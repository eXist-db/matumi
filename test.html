                <p class="block"> The basic, etymological meaning of the Japanese word <span class="italic">shine</span>, which is used to translate the English word "nature," is the
                power of spontaneous self-development and what results from that power. The Chinese characters for the Japanese term <span class="italic">shine</span>
                literally mean "from itself thus it is." It expresses a mode of being rather than the existence or "nature" of objects in the natural order. </p>
                <p class="block"> The term <span class="italic">shine</span>, if understood as a general expression encompassing heaven and earth, including mountains, water, animals,
                and plants, cannot be found in <a class="language name" href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Classical_Japanese_language" target="_new" rel="Classical_Japanese_language">ancient Japanese</a>. This was not
                due to any lack of a capacity for abstract thought on the part of the <a class="people name" href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Japanese_people" target="_new" rel="Japanese_people">Japanese
                  people </a> in ancient times, but because their chief concern was to recognize each and every phenomenon as a manifestation of the <a class="institution name" href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Kami" target="_new" rel="Kami">KAMI (god or gods)</a> behind it. It was hard for them to think of the ever-flowing wind
                and the immovable mountains as all belonging to the same general classification of nature. It is safe to say that the "articulated" thought process
                of the <a class="people name" href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Japanese_people" target="_new" rel="Japanese_people">Japanese</a> (which is reflected in their polytheism) tied up with their
                aesthetic sensibility to separate the universe into its elements and, consequently, to forestall simplified generalizations about it. If we insist,
                however, on finding generic terms for nature in the ancient literature, we can offer comprehensive expressions like <span class="italic">ametsuchi</span>
                (heaven and earth) and <span class="italic">ikitoshi ikeromono</span> (living things). </p>
