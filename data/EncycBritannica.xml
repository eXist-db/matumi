                        <p>,<gloss target="#ART" rend="unmarked"> a word in its most extended and most popular sense meaning everything which we distinguish
                                from Nature</gloss>. Art and Nature are the two most comprehensive genera of which the human mind has formed the conception.
                            Under the genus Nature, or the genus Art, we include all the phenomena of the universe. But as our conception of Nature is
                            indeterminate and variable, so in some degree is our conception of Art. Nor does such ambiguity arise only because some modes of
                            thought refer a greater number of the phenomena of the universe to the genus Nature, and others a greater number to the genus Art.
                            It arises also because we do not strictly limit the one genus by the other. The range of the phenomena to which we point, when we
                            say Art, is never very exactly determined by the range of the other phenomena which at the same time we tacitly refer to the order
                            of Nature. Everybody understands the general meaning of a phrase like <cit>
                                <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer's</name>
                                </ref>
                                <quote>"Nature ne Art ne koude him not amende"</quote>
                            </cit>, or <cit>
                                <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Pope">Pope's</name>
                                </ref>
                                <quote>"Blest with each grace of nature and of art"</quote>
                            </cit>. In such phrases we intend to designate familiarly as Nature all which exists independently of our study, forethought and
                            exertion—in other words, those phenomena in ourselves or the world which we do not originate but find; and we intend to designate
                            familiarly as Art all which we do not find but originate—or, in other words, the phenomena which we add by study, forethought and
                            exertion to those existing independently of us. But we do not use these designations consistently. Sometimes we draw an arbitrary
                            line in the action of individuals and societies, and say, Here Nature ends and Art begins—such a law, such a practice, such an
                            industry even, is natural, and such another is artificial; calling those natural which happen spontaneously and without much
                            reflection, and the others artificial. But this line different observers draw at different places. Sometimes we adopt views which
                            waive the distinction altogether. One such view is that wherein all phenomena are regarded as equally natural, and the idea of
                            Nature is extended so as to include <quote>"all the powers existing in either the outer or the inner world, and everything which
                                exists by means of those powers"</quote>. In this view Art becomes a part of Nature. It is illustrated in the familiar passage
                            of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare">Shakespeare</name>, where <name type="person">Polixenes</name> reminds <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perdita_(The_Winter's_Tale)">Perdita</name>

                        <p>A posthumous essay of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">John Stuart Mill</name> contains a full
                            philosophical exposition and defence of this mode of regarding the relations of Nature and Art. Defining Nature as above, and again
                            as a <quote>"collective name for all facts, actual and possible"</quote>, that writer proceeds to say that such a definition
                                <quote>"is evidently inapplicable to some of the modes in which the word is familiarly employed. For example, it entirely
                                conflicts with the common form of speech by which Nature is opposed to Art, and natural to artificial. For in the sense of the
                                word Nature which has thus been defined, and which is the true scientific sense, Art is as much Nature as anything else; and
                                everything which is artificial is natural—Art has no independent powers of its own: Art is but the employment of the powers of
                                Nature for an end. Phenomena produced by human agency, no less than those which, as far as we are concerned, are spontaneous,
                                depend on the properties of the elementary forces, or of the elementary substances and their compounds. The united powers of the
                                whole human race could not create a new property of matter in general, or of any one of its species. We can only take advantage
                                for our purposes of the properties we find. A ship floats by the same laws of specific gravity and equilibrium as a tree
                                uprooted by the wind and blown into the water. The corn which men raise for food grows and produces its grain by the same laws
                                of vegetation by which the wild rose and the mountain strawberry bring forth their flowers and fruit. A house stands and holds
                                together by the natural properties, the weight and cohesion of the materials which compose it. A steam engine works by the
                                natural expansive force of steam, exerting a pressure upon one part of a system of arrangements, which pressure, by the
                                mechanical properties of the lever, is transferred from that to another part, where it raises the weight or removes the obstacle
                                brought into connexion with it. In these and all other artificial operations the office of man is, as has often been remarked, a
                                very limited one; it consists of moving things into certain places. We move objects, and by doing this, bring some things into
                                contact which were separate, or separate others which were in contact; and by this simple change of place, natural forces
                                previously dormant are called into action, and produce the desired effect. Even the volition which designs, the intelligence
                                which contrives, and the muscular force which executes these movements, are themselves powers of Nature"</quote>.</p>
                        <p>Another mode of thought, in some sort complementary to the last, is based on the analogy which the operations of forces external to a
                            man bear to the operations of man himself. Study, forethought and exertion are assigned to Nature, and her operations are called
                            operations of Art. This view was familiar to ancient systems of philosophy, and especially to that of the Stoics. According to the
                            report of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, Nature as conceived by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeno_of_Citium">Zeno</name> was a fire, and at the same time a voluntary agent having the power
                            or art of creating things with regularity and design (<quote>"naturam esse ignem artificiosum ad gignendum progredientem
                                via"</quote>) . To this fire not merely creative force and <pb n="658" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0658.png"/> systematic action were ascribed, but actual
                            personality. Nature was <quote>"non artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex"</quote>. <quote>"That which in the works of human art is
                                done by hands, is done with much greater art by Nature, that is, by a fire which exercises an art and is the teacher of other
                                arts"</quote>. This conception of Nature as an all-generating fire, and at the same time as a personal artist both teaching and
                            including in her own activity all the human arts, on the one hand may be said, with <name type="person">Polixenes</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name>, to merge Art in Nature ; but on the other
                            hand it finds the essence of Nature in the resemblance of her operations to those of Art. <quote>"It is the <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> of art,"</quote> according to the same system, <quote>"to create and beget,"</quote> and the reasoning
                            proceeds —Nature creates and begets, therefore Nature is an artist or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demiurge">Demiurgus</name>. A kindred view is set forth by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Browne">Sir Thomas
                                Browne</name> in the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religio_Medici">
                                <hi rend="italic">Religio Medici</hi>
                            </title>, when
                            he declares that <quote>"all things are artificial; for Nature is the Art of God"</quote>.</p>
                        <p>But these modes of thought, according to which, on the one hand, the processes of Art are included among processes of Nature, or on
                            the other the processes of Nature among the processes of Art, are exceptional. In ordinary use the two conceptions, each of them
                            somewhat vague and inexact, are antithetical. Their antithesis was what <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson</name> had chiefly in his mind when he defined Art as <quote>"the
                                power of doing something which is not taught by Nature or by instinct"</quote>. But this definition is insufficient, because the
                            abstract word Art, whether used of all arts at once or of one at a time, is a name not only for the power of doing something, but
                            for the exercise of the power; and not only for the exercise of the power, but for the rules according to which it is exercised; and
                            not only for the rules, but for the result. Painting, for instance, is an art, and the word connotes not only the power to paint,
                            but the act of painting; and not only the act, but the laws for performing the act rightly; and not only all these, but the-material
                            consequences of the act or the thing painted. So of agriculture, navigation and the rest. Exception might also be taken to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson's</name> definition on the ground that it excludes all
                            actions of instinct from the genus Art, whereas usage has in more languages than one given the name of Art to several of those
                            ingenuities in the lower animals which popular theory at the same time declares to be instinctive. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</name>, for instance, speaks of boughs shaken by the wind, but not so
                            violently as to make the birds forgo their Art—</p>

                            not of poetry but of science :—<quote>"Most animals—as, for instance, bees, spiders and beavers—have a kind of art peculiar to
                                themselves; but each race of animals has no more than one art, and this one has had no first inventor among the race. Man, on
                                the other hand, has an infinity of different arts which were not born with his race, and of which the glory is his own"</quote>.
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson</name> might reply that those properties of
                            variety and of originality or individual invention, which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_le_Bovier_de_Fontenelle">Fontenelle</name> himself alleges in the ingenuities of man
                            but not in those of the lower animals, are sufficient to make a generic difference, and to establish the impropriety of calling a
                            honeycomb or a spider's web a work of Art. It is not our purpose to trespass on ground so debateable as that of the nature of
                            consciousness in the lower animals. Enough that when we use the term Art of any action, it is because we are thinking of properties
                            in the action from which we infer, whether justly or not, that the agent voluntarily and designedly puts forth skill for known ends
                            and by regular and uniform methods. If, then, we were called upon to frame a general definition of Art, giving the word its widest
                            and most comprehensive meaning, it would run thus :—<hi rend="italic">Every regulated operation or dexterity by which organized
                                beings pursue ends which they know beforehand, together with the rules and the result of every such operation or
                            dexterity</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Here it will be well to consider very briefly the natural history of the name which has been given to this very comprehensive
                            conception by the principal branches of civilized mankind. Our own word Art the English language has taken, as all the Romance
                            languages of modern Europe have taken theirs, directly from the Latin. The Latin <term xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">ars</hi>
                            </term>, according to the prevailing opinion of philologists, proceeds from a root AR, of which the primitive
                            signification was to put or fit things together, and which is to be found in a large family of Greek words. The Greek <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi>
                            </term> the name both for arts in the particular and art in the abstract, is by its
                            root related both to <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέκ-τωυ</hi>
                            </term> and <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέκ-υου</hi>
                            </term>, and thus contains the allied ideas of making and begetting. The <term xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi>
                            </term> of art in the logic of the Stoics, <quote>"to create and beget"</quote>, was strictly in accordance
                            with this etymology. The Teutonic <term xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi>
                            </term> is formed from <hi rend="italic">können</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">können</hi> is developed from a primitive <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">kann</hi> philology is inclined to recognize a preterite form of a lost verb, of which we find the traces in <hi rend="italic">Kin-d</hi>, a child ; and the form <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi> thus meaning originally "I begot," contains the
                            germ of the two several developments,—<hi rend="italic">können</hi>, "to be master," "to be able," and <hi rend="italic">kennen</hi>, "to know." We thus see that the chief Indo-European languages have with one consent extended a name for the most
                            elementary exercise of a constructive or productive power, till that name has covered the whole range of the skilled and deliberate
                            operations of sentient beings.</p>
                        <p>In proportion as men left out of sight the idea of creation, of constructing or producing, <q>"artificiosum esse ad gignendum"</q>,
                            which is the primitive half of this extended notion, and attended only to the idea of skill, of proceeding by regular and
                            disciplined methods, <q>"progredi via,"</q> which is the superadded half, the whole notion Art, and the name for it, might become
                            subject to a process of thought which, if analysed, would be like this:— What is done by regular and disciplined methods is Art;
                            facts are observed and classified, and a systematic view of the order of the universe obtained, by regular and disciplined methods;
                            the observing and classifying of facts, and obtaining a systematic view of the order of the universe, is therefore Art. To a partial
                            extent this did unconsciously take place. Science, of which the essence is only in knowledge and theory, came to be spoken of as
                            Art, of which the essence is all in practice and production. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, notwithstanding his citation of the Stoical dictum that practice and production were of the essence of Art,
                            elsewhere divides Art into two kinds—one by which things are only contemplated in the mind, another by which something is produced
                            and done. (<cit>
                                <quote>"Quumque artium aliud eiusmodi sit, ut tantummodo rem cernat; aliud, ut moliatur aliquid et faciat."</quote>

                            </cit>) Of the former kind his instance is geometry; of the latter the art of playing on the lyre. Now geometry, understanding by
                            geometry an acquisition of the mind, that is, a collected body of observations and deductions concerning the properties of space and
                            magnitude, is a science and not an art; although there is an art of the geometer, which is the skill by which he solves any given
                            problem in his science, and the rules of that skill, and his exertion in putting it forth. And so every science has its instrumental
                            art or practical discipline; and in as far as the word Art is used only of the practical discipline or dexterity of the geometer,
                            the astronomer, the logician, the grammarian, or other person whose business it is to collect and classify facts for contemplation,
                            in so far the usage is just. The same justification may be extended to another usage, whereby in Latin, and some of its derivative
                            languages, the name Art came to be transferred in a concrete sense to the body of rules, the written code or manual, which lays down
                            the discipline and regulates the dexterity; as <hi rend="italic">ars grammatica, ars logica, ars rhetorica</hi> and the rest. But
                            when the word is stretched so as to mean the sciences, as theoretical acquisitions of the mind, that meaning is illegitimate.
                            Whether or not <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, in the passage above quoted, had in his
                            mind the science of geometry as a collected body of observations and deductions, it is certain that the Ciceronian phrase of the <hi rend="italic">liberal arts</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">ingenuous arts</hi>, both in Latin and its derivatives or translations in
                            modern speech, has been used currently to denote the sciences themselves, and not merely the disciplines instrumental to them. The
                                <hi rend="italic">trivium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">quadrivium</hi> (grammar, logic and rhetoric—geometry, astronomy, music
                            and arithmetic) have been habitually called arts, when some of them have been named in that sense in which they mean <pb n="659" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0659.png"/>
                            not arts but sciences, <q>"only contemplating things in the mind."</q> Hence the nomenclature, history and practical organization,
                            especially in Britain, of one great division of university studies: the division of <q>"arts,"</q> with its <q>"faculty,"</q> its
                            examinations, and its degrees.</p>
                        <p>In the German language the words for Art and Science have in general been loosely interchanged. The etymology of the word for Art
                            secured a long continuance for this ambiguity. <term xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi>
                            </term> was employed indiscriminately
                            in both the senses of the primitive <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi>, to signify what I know, or Science, and what I can do, or Art.
                            It was not till the end of the 17th century that a separate word for Science, the modern <term xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Wissenschaft</hi>
                            </term>, came into use. On the other hand, the Greek word <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi>
                            </term>, with its distinct suggestion of the root signification to make or get, acted probably as a safeguard
                            against this tendency. The distinction between <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi>
                            </term>, Art or practice, and <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">έπιστήμη</hi>
                            </term>, knowledge or Science, is observed, though not systematically, in Greek
                            philosophy. But for our present purpose, that of making clear the true relation between the one conception and the other, further
                            quotation is rendered superfluous by the discussion the subject has received at the hands of the modern writer already quoted.
                            Between Art, of which we practise the rules, and Science, of which we entertain the doctrines, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name> establishes the difference in the simplest shape, by
                            pointing out that one grammatical mood is proper for the conclusions of Science, and another for those of Art. Science enunciates
                            her conclusions in the indicative mood, whereas <quote>"the imperative is the characteristic of Art, as distinguished from
                                Science."</quote> And as Art utters her conclusions in her own form, so she supplies the substance of her own major premise.
                                <quote>"Every art has one first principle, or general major premise, not borrowed from science, that which enunciates the object
                                aimed at, and affirms it to be a desirable object. The builder's art assumes that it is desirable to have buildings;
                                architecture (as one of the fine arts) that it is desirable to have them beautiful and imposing. The hygienic and medical arts
                                assume, the one that the preservation of health, the other that the cure of disease, are fitting and desirable ends. These are
                                not propositions of science. Propositions of science assert a matter of fact—an existence, a co-existence, a succession, or a
                                resemblance. The propositions now spoken of do not assert that anything is, but enjoin or recommend that something should be.
                                They are a class by themselves. A proposition of which the predicate is expressed by the words <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> or
                                    <hi rend="italic">should be</hi> is generically different from one which is expressed by <hi rend="italic">is</hi> or <hi rend="italic">will be</hi>."</quote> And the logical relation of Art and Science, in other words, the manner of framing the
                            intermediate member between the general major premise of Art and its imperative conclusion, is thus defined:— <cit>
                                <quote>"The Art [in any given case] proposes to itself an end to be attained, defines the end, and hands it over to the Science.
                                    The Science receives it, considers it as a phenomenon or effect to be studied, and having investigated its causes and
                                    conditions, sends it back to Art with a theorem of the causes and combinations by which it could be produced. Art then
                                    examines these combinations of circumstances, and according as any of them are or are not in human power, pronounces the end
                                    attainable or not. The only one of the premises, therefore, which Art supplies, is the original major premise, which asserts
                                    that the attainment of the given end is desirable. Science, then, lends to Art the proposition (obtained by a series of
                                    inductions or deductions) that the performance of certain actions will attain the end. From these premises Art concludes
                                    that the performance of these actions is desirable, and finding it also practicable, converts the theorem into a rule or
                                    precept. ... The grounds, then, of every rule of Art are to be found in the theorems of Science. An Art, or a body of Art,
                                    consists of the rules, together with as much of the speculative propositions as comprises the justification of these rules.
                                    The complete Art of any matter includes a selection of such a portion from the Science as is necessary to show on what
                                    conditions the effects, which the Art aims at producing, depend. And Art in general consists of the truths of Science
                                    arranged in the most convenient order for practice, instead of the order which is most convenient for thought. Science
                                    groups and arranges its truths so as to enable us to take in at one view as much as possible of the general order of the
                                    universe. Art, though it must assume the same general laws, follows them only into such of their detailed consequences as
                                    have led to the formation of rules of conduct, and brings together from parts of the field of Science most remote from one
                                    another, the truths relating to the production of the different and heterogeneous causes necessary to each effect which the
                                    exigencies of practical life require to be produced."</quote>

                        <p>The whole discussion may be summed up thus. Science consists in knowing, Art consists in doing. What I must do in order to know, is
                            Art subservient to Science: what I must know in order to do, is Science subservient to Art.</p>
                        <p>Art, then, is defined by two broad distinctions: first, its popular distinction from Nature; and next, its practical and theoretic
                            distinction from Science. Both of these distinctions are observed in the terms of our definition given above. Within the proper
                            limits of this definition, the conception of Art, and the use of the word for it, have undergone sundry variations. These variations
                            correspond to certain vicissitudes or developments in the order of historical facts and in society. The requirements of society,
                            stimulating the ingenuity of its individual members, have led to the invention of arts and groups of arts, constantly progressing,
                            with the progress of civilization, in number, in complexity, and in resource. The religious imagination of early societies, who find
                            themselves in possession of such an art or group of arts, forgets the history of the invention, and assigns it to the inspiration or
                            special grace of some god or hero. So the Greeks assigned the arts of agriculture to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triptolemus">Triptolemus</name>, those of spinning and navigation to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ATHENA">Athena</name>, and of music to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo">Apollo</name>. At one stage of civilization one art or group of arts is held in higher
                            esteem, another at another. In societies, like most of those of the ancient world, where slaves were employed in domestic service,
                            and upon the handicrafts supplying the immediate utilities of life—food, shelter and clothing—these constituted a group of servile
                            arts. The arts of husbandry or agriculture, on the other hand, have alternately been regarded as servile and as honourable according
                            as their exercise has been in the hands of a subject class, as under feudal institutions, or, as under the Roman republic, of free
                            cultivators. Under feudal institutions, or in a society in a state of permanent war, the allied arts of war and of government have
                            been held the only honourable class. In commercial states, like the republics of Italy, the arts of gain, or of production (other
                            than agricultural) and distribution, have made good their title to equal estimation and greater power beside the art of captains.
                            But among peaceful arts, industries or trades, some have always been held to be of higher and others of lower rank; the higher rank
                            being assigned to those that required larger operations, higher training, or more thoughtful conduct, and yielded ampler returns—the
                            lower rank to those which called for simple manual exercise, especially if such exercise was of a disagreeable or degrading kind. In

                        <p>The arts of which we have hitherto spoken have arisen from positive requirements, and supply what are strictly utilities, in
                            societies; not excluding the art of war, at least so far as concerns one-half of war, the defensive half. But war continued to be an
                            honourable pursuit, because it was a pursuit associated with birth, power and wealth, as well as with the virtue of courage, in
                            cases where it had no longer the plea of utility, but was purely aggressive or predatory; and the arts of the chase have stood in
                            this respect in an analogous position to those of war.</p>
                        <p>There are other arts which have not had their origin in positive practical needs, but have been practised from the first for pleasure
                            or amusement. The most primitive human beings of whom we have any knowledge, the cave-dwellers of the palaeolithic period, had not
                            only the useful art of chipping stones into spear-heads, knife-heads and arrow-heads, and making shafts or handles of these
                            implements out of bone; they had also the ornamental art of scratching upon the bone handle the outlines of the animals they
                            saw—mammoth, rhinoceros or reindeer—or of carving such a handle into a rude resemblance of one of these animals. Here we have a
                            skill exercised, in the first case, for pure fancy or pleasure, and in the second, for adding an element of fancy or pleasure to an
                            element of utility. Here, therefore, is the <pb n="660" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0660.png"/> germ of all those arts which produce imitations of natural objects for
                            purposes of entertainment or delight, as painting, sculpture, and their subordinates; and of all those which fashion useful objects
                            in one way rather than another because the one way gives pleasure and the other does not, as architecture and the subordinate
                            decorative arts of furniture, pottery and the rest. Arts that work in a kindred way with different materials are those of dancing
                            and music. Dancing works with the physical movements of human beings. Music works with sound. Between that imitative and plastic
                            group, and the group of these which only produce motion or sound and pass away, there is the intermediate group of eloquence and the
                            drama, which deal with the expression of human feeling in spoken words and acted gestures. There is also the comprehensive art of
                            poetry, which works with the material of written words, and can ideally represent the whole material of human life and experience.
                            Of all these arts the end is not use but pleasure, or pleasure before use, or at least pleasure and use conjointly. In modern
                            language, there has grown up a usage which has put them into a class by themselves under the name of the Fine Arts, as distinguished
                            from the Useful or Mechanical Arts. (See AESTHETICS and FINE ARTS.) Nay more, to them alone is often appropriated the use of the
                            generic word Art, as if they and they only were the arts <term xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">κατ’έξοχήν</hi>
                            </term>. And further
                            yet, custom has reduced the number which the class-word is meant to include. When Art and the works of Art are now currently spoken
                            of in this sense, not even music or poetry is frequently denoted, but only architecture, sculpture and painting by themselves, or
                            with their subordinate and decorative branches. In correspondence with this usage, another usage has removed from the class of <hi rend="italic">arts</hi>, and put into a contrasted class of <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>, a large number of industries
                            and their products, to which the generic term Art, according to our definition, properly applies. The definition covers the <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> arts, which can be efficiently exercised by mere trained habit, rote or calculation, just as well
                            as the fine arts, which have to be exercised by a higher order of powers. But the word Art, becoming appropriated to the fine arts,
                            has been treated as if it necessarily carried along with it, and as if works to be called works of art must necessarily possess, the
                            attributes of free individual skill and invention, expressing themselves in ever new combinations of pleasurable contrivance, and
                            seeking perfection not as a means towards some ulterior practical end but as an ideal end in itself.</p>

                                the north-eastern portion of the great mass of land which constitutes what is generally known as the Old World, of which Europe
                                forms the northwestern and Africa the south-western region</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Much doubt attaches to the origin of the name. Some of the earliest Greek geographers divided their known world into two portions
                            only, Europe and Asia, in which last <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libya_(mythology)">Libya</name> (the Greek
                            name for Africa) was included. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, who ranks <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Libya_(mythology)">Libya</name> as one of the chief divisions of the world,
                            separating it from Asia, repudiates as fables the ordinary explanations assigned to the names Europe and Asia, but confesses his
                            inability to say whence they came. It would appear probable, however, that the former of these words was derived from an <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyrian</name> or <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrews">Hebrew</name> root, which signifies the west or setting sun, and the latter from a
                            corresponding root meaning the east or rising sun, and that they were used at one time to imply the west and the east. There is
                            ground also for supposing that they may at first have been used with a specific or restricted local application, a more extended
                            signification having eventually been given to them. After the word Asia had acquired its larger sense, it was still specially used
                            by the Greeks to designate the country around <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus">Ephesus</name>. The idea
                            of Asia as originally formed was necessarily indefinite, and long continued to be so; and the area to which the name was finally
                            applied, as geographical knowledge increased, was to a great extent determined by arbitrary and not very precise conceptions, rather
                            than on the basis of natural relations and differences subsisting between it and the surrounding regions.</p>

                            <p> The northern boundary of Asia is formed by the Arctic Ocean; the coast-line falls between 700 and 75° N., and so lies within the
                                Arctic circle, having its extreme northern point in Cape Sivero-Vostochnyi (i.e. north-east) or Chelyuskin, in 78° N. On the
                                south the coast-line is far more irregular, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the China Sea reaching about to the northern
                                tropic at the mouths of the Indus, of the Ganges and of the Canton river; <pb n="735" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0735.png"/> while the great peninsulas of Arabia,
                                Hindostan and Cambodia descend to about 10° N., and the Malay peninsula extends within a degree and a half of the equator. On
                                the west the extreme point of Asia is found on the shore of the Mediterranean, at Cape Baba, in 260 E., not far from the
                                Dardanelles. Thence the boundary passes in the one direction through the Mediterranean, and down the Red Sea to the southern
                                point of Arabia, at the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, in 450 E.; and in the other through the Black Sea, and along the range of
                                Caucasus, following approximately 400 N. to the Caspian, whence it turns to the north on a line not far from the 60th meridian,
                                along the Ural Mountains, and meets the Arctic Ocean nearly opposite the island of Novaya Zemlya. The most easterly point of
                                Asia is East Cape (Vostochnyi, i.e. east, or Dezhnev), in 190° E., at the entrance of Bering Strait. The boundary between this
                                point and the extremity of the Malay Peninsula follows the coast of the Northern Pacific and the China Sea, on a line deeply
                                broken by the projection of the peninsulas of Kamchatka and Korea, and the recession of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Yellow Sea, and
                                the Gulfs of Tongking and Siam.</p>

                            <p>On the east and south-east of Asia are several important groups of islands, the more southern of which link this continent to
                                Australia, and to the islands of the Pacific. The islands. Kurile islands, the Japanese group, Luchu, Formosa and the
                                Philippines, may be regarded as unquestionable outliers of Asia. Between the islands of the Malay archipelago from Sumatra to
                                New Guinea, and the neighbouring Asiatic continent, no definite relations appear ever to have existed, and no distinctly marked
                                boundary for Asia has been established by the old geographers in this quarter. Modern science, however, has indicated a line of
                                physical separation along the channel between Borneo and Celebes, called the Straits of Macassar, which follows approximately
                                120° E., to the west of which the flora and fauna are essentially Asiatic in their type, while to the south and east the
                                Australian element begins to be distinctly marked, soon to become predominant. To this boundary has been given the name of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wallace_Line">Wallace's line</name>, after the eminent naturalist, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred_Russel_Wallace">A.R.

                            <p>Owing to the great extent of Asia, it is not easy to obtain a correct conception of the actual form of its outline from ordinary
                                maps, the distortions which accompany projections of Form of large spherical areas on a flat surface being necessarily great and
                                misleading. Turning, therefore, to a globe, Asia viewed as a whole, will be seen to have the form of a great isosceles spherical
                                triangle, having its north-eastern apex at East Cape (Vostochnyi), in Bering Strait; its two equal sides, in length about a
                                quadrant of the sphere, or 6500 m., extending on the west to the southern point of Arabia, and on the east to the extremity of
                                the Malay peninsula; and the base between these points occupying about 60° of a great circle, or 4500 m., and being deeply
                                indented by the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on either side of the Indian peninsula. A great circle, drawn through East
                                Cape and the southern point of Arabia, passes nearly along the coast-line of the Arctic Ocean, over the Ural Mountains, through
                                the western part of the Caspian, and nearly along the boundary between Persia and Asiatic Turkey. Asia Minor and the
                                north-western half of Arabia lie outside such a great circle, which otherwise indicates, with fair accuracy, the north-western
                                boundary of Asia. In like manner a great circle drawn through East Cape and the extremity of the Malay peninsula, passes nearly
                                over the coasts of Manchuria, China and Cochin-China, and departs comparatively little from the eastern boundary.</p>

                            <p>Asia is divided laterally along the parallel of 400 north by a depression which, beginning on the east of the desert of Gobi,
                                extends westwards through Mongolia to Chinese Turkestan. To the west of Kashgar the central depression is limited by the
                                meridional range of Sarikol and the great elevation of the Pamir, of which the Sarikol is the eastern face. The level of this
                                depression (once a vast inland sea) between the mountains which enclose the sources of the Hwang-ho and the Sarikol range
                                probably never exceeds 2000 ft. above sea, and modern researches tend to prove that in the central portions of the Gobi (about
                                Lop Nor) it may be actually below sea-level. A vast proportion of the continent north of this central line is but a few hundred
                                feet in altitude. Shelving gradually upward from the low flats of Siberia the general continental level rises to a great central
                                waterparting, or divide, which stretches from the Black Sea through the Elburz and the Hindu Kush to the Tian-shan mountains in
                                the Pamir region, and hence to Bering Strait on the extreme north-east. This great divide is not always marked by well-defined
                                ranges facing steeply either to the north or south. There are considerable spaces where the strike, or axis, of the main ranges
                                is transverse to the water-parting, which is then represented by intermediate highlands forming lacustrine regions with an
                                indefinite watershed. Only a part of this great continental divide (including such ranges as the Hindu Kush, Tian-shan, Altai or
                                Khangai) rises to any great height, a considerable portion of it being below 5000 ft. in altitude. South of the divide the level
                                at once drops to the central depression of Gobi, which forms a vast interior, almost waterless space, where the local drainage
                                is lost in deserts or swamps. South of this enclosed depression is another great hydrographic barrier which parts it from the
                                low plains of the Amur, of China, Siam and India, bordered by the shallows of the Yellow Sea and the shoals which enclose the
                                islands of Japan and Formosa, all of them once an integral part of the continent. This second barrier is one of the most mighty
                                upheavals in the world, by reason both of its extent and its altitude. Starting from the Amur river and reaching along the
                                eastern margin of the Gobi desert towards the sources of the Hwangho, it merges into the Altyn-tagh and the Kuen-lun, forming
                                the northern face of the vast Tibetan highlands which are bounded on the south by the Himalaya. The Pamir highlands between the
                                base of the Tian-shan mountains and the eastern buttresses of the Hindu Kush unite these two great divides, enclosing the Gobi
                                depression on the west; and they would again be united on the east but for the transverse valley of the Amur, which parts the

                                than 5000 ft. above sea, where all the main rivers flow northward to the Mediterranean, the Arctic Sea, or the Caspian; a
                                central section of depression, where the drainage is lost in swamps or <hi rend="italic">hamūns</hi>, and of which the average
                                level probably does not exceed 2000 ft. above sea; and a southern section divided between highly elevated table-lands from
                                15,000 to 16,000 ft. in altitude, and lowlands of the Arabian, Indian, Siamese and Chinese peninsulas, with an ocean outlet for
                                its drainage; we find that there is only one direct connexion between northern and southern sections which involves no mountain
                                passes, and no formidable barrier of altitudes. That one is afforded by the narrow valley of the Hari Rud to the west of Herat.
                                From the Caspian to Karachi it is possible to pass without encountering any orographic obstacle greater than the divide which
                                separates the valley of the Hari Rud from the Helmund <hi rend="italic">hamūn</hi> basin, which may be represented by an
                                altitude of about 4000 ft. above sea-level. This fact possesses great significance in connexion with the development of Asiatic

                                the indefinitely extended swamps of Persia. Many of them are at high elevations (Lake Victoria, 13,400 ft., being probably the
                                most elevated), and are undoubted vestiges of an ancient period of glaciation. Such lakes, as a rule, show indications of a

                                solid crust <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the ocean level—are most easily recognized and are of special convenience; and although
                                such boundaries, from following lines on which the continuity of the land is interrupted, often necessarily indicate important
                                differences in the conditions of adjoining countries, and of their political and physical relations, yet variations of the
                                elevation of the surface <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the sea-level frequently produce effects not less marked. The changes of
                                temperature and climate caused by difference of elevation are quite comparable in their magnitude and effect on all organized
                                creatures with those due to differences of latitude; and the relative position of the high and low lands on the earth's surface,

                            <p>From such causes the physical conditions of a large part of Asia, and the history of its population, have been very greatly
                                influenced by the occurrence of the mass of mountain above described, which includes the Himalaya and the whole elevated area
                                having true physical connexion with that range, and occupies an area about 2000 m. in length and varying from 100 to 500 m. in
                                width, between 65º and 100° east and between 28° and 35º north. These mountains, which include the highest peaks in the world,
                                rise, along their entire length, far above the line of perpetual snow, and few of the passes across the main ridges are at a
                                less altitude than 15,000 or 16,000 ft. above the sea. Peaks of 20,000 ft. abound along the whole chain, and the points that
                                exceed that elevation are numerous. A mountain range such as this, attaining altitudes at which vegetable life ceases, and the
                                support of animal life is extremely difficult, constitutes an almost impassable barrier against the spread of all forms of
                                living creatures. The mountain mass, moreover, is not less important in causing a complete separation between the atmospheric
                                conditions on its opposite flanks, by reason of the extent to which it penetrates that stratum of the atmosphere which is in
                                contact with the earth's surface and is effective in determining climate. The highest summits create serious obstructions to the
                                movements of nearly three-fourths of the mass of the air resting on this part of the earth, and of nearly the whole of the
                                moisture it contains ; the average height of the entire chain is such as to make it an almost absolute barrier to one-half of
                                the air and three-fourths of the moisture; while the lower ranges also produce important atmospheric effects, one-fourth of the
                                air and one-half of the watery vapour it carries with it lying below 9000 ft.</p>
                            <p>This great mass of mountain, constituting as it does a complete natural line of division across a large part of the continent,
                                will form a convenient basis from which to work, in proceeding, as will now be done, to give a general view of the principal
                                countries contained in Asia.</p>

                            <p>The summit of the great mountain mass is occupied by Tibet, a country known by its inhabitants under the name of <hi rend="italic">Bod</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bodyul</hi>. Tibet is a rugged table-land, narrow as compared with its length,
                                broken up by a succession of mountain ranges, which follow as a rule the direction of the length of the table-land, and commonly
                                rise into the regions of perpetual snow ; between the flanks of these lie valleys, closely hemmed in, usually narrow, having a
                                very moderate inclination, but at intervals opening out into wide plains, and occupied either by rivers, or frequently by lakes
                                from which there is no outflow and the waters of which are salt. The eastern termination of Tibet is in the line of snowy
                                mountains which flanks China on the west, between the 27th and 35th parallels of latitude, and about 103º east. On the west the
                                table-land is prolonged beyond the political limits of Tibet, though with much the same physical features, to about 70° east,
                                beyond which it terminates; and the ranges which are covered with perpetual snow as far west as Samarkand, thence rapidly
                                diminish in height, and terminate in low hills north of Bokhara.</p>
                            <p>The mean elevation of Tibet may be taken as 15,000 ft. above the sea. The broad mountainous slope by which it is connected with
                                the lower levels of Hindustan contains the ranges known as the Himalaya ; the name Kuen-lun is generally applied to the northern
                                slope that descends to the central plains of the Gobi, though these mountains are not locally known under those names, Kuen-lun
                                being apparently a Chinese designation.</p>
                            <p>The extreme rigour of the climate of Tibet, which combines great cold with great drought, makes the country essentially very
                                poor, and the chief portion of it little better than desert. The vegetation is everywhere most scanty, and scarcely anything
                                deserving the name of a tree is to be found unless in the more sheltered spots, and then artificially planted. The population in
                                the lower and warmer valleys live in houses, and follow agriculture ; in the higher regions they are nomadic shepherds, thinly
                                scattered over a large area.</p>

                                Malay peninsula, and the east flank of Bengal. Between these ranges, which are probably permanently snowy to about 27° N., flow
                                the great rivers of the Indo-Chinese peninsula, the Mekong, the Menam, the Salween, and the Irrawaddy, the valleys of which form
                                the main portions of the states of Cochin- China (including Tongking and Cambodia), of Siam (including Laos) and of Burma. The
                                people of Cochin-China are called Anam ; it is probably from a corruption of their name for the capital of Tongking, Kechao,
                                that the Portuguese Cochin has been derived. All these countries are well watered, populous and fertile, with a climate very
                                similar to that of eastern Bengal. The geography of the region in which the mountains of Cochin-China and Siam join Tibet is
                                still imperfectly known, but there is no ground left for doubting that the great river of eastern Tibet, the Tsanpo, supplies
                                the main stream of the Brahmaputra. The two great rivers of China, the Hwang-ho and the Yang-tsze-kiang, take their rise from
                                the eastern face of Tibet, the former from the north-east angle, the latter from the south-east. The main stream of this last is
                                called Dichu in Tibet, and its chief feeder is the Ya-lung-kiang, which rises not far from the Hwang-ho, and is considered the
                                territorial boundary between China and Tibet.</p>

                                Indian Ocean. The Indian peninsula from 25º N. south- wards is a table-land, having its greatest elevation on the west, where
                                the highest points rise to over 8000 ft., though the ordinary altitude of the higher hills hardly exceeds 4000 ft. : the general
                                level of the table-land lies between 3000 ft. as a maximum and 1000 ft.</p>
                            <p>From the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra on the east to that of the Indus on the west, and intervening between the tableland
                                of the peninsula and the foot of the Himalayan slope of the Tibetan plateau, lies the great plain of northern India, which rises
                                at its highest point to about 1000 ft., and includes altogether, with its prolongation up the valley of Assam, an area of about
                                500.000 sq. m., comprising the richest, the most populous and most civilized districts of India. The great plain extends, with
                                an almost unbroken surface, from the most western to the most eastern extremity of British India, and is composed of deposits so
                                finely comminuted, that it is no exaggeration to say that it is possible to go from the Bay of Bengal up the Ganges, through the
                                Punjab, and down the Indus again to the sea, over a distance of 2000 m. and more, without finding a pebble, however small.</p>
                            <p>The great rivers of northern India—the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Indus—all derive their waters from the Tibetan mountain
                                mass ; and it is a remarkable circumstance that the northern water-parting of India should lie to the north of the Himalaya in
                                the regions of central Tibet.</p>
                            <p>The population of India is very large, some of its districts being among the most densely peopled in the world. The country is
                                generally well cleared, and forests are, as a rule, found only along the flanks of the mountains, where the fall of rain is most
                                abundant. The more open parts are highly cultivated, and large cities abound. The climate is generally such as to secure the
                                population the necessaries of life without severe labour; the extremes of heat and drought are such as to render the land
                                unsuitable for pasture, and the people everywhere subsist by cultivation of the soil or commerce, and live in settled villages
                                or towns.</p>
                            <p>The island of Ceylon is distinguished from the neighbouring parts of British India by little more than its separate
                                administration and the Buddhistic religion of its population. The highest point in Ceylon rises to about 9000 ft. above the sea,
                                and the mountain slopes are densely covered with forest. The lower levels are in climate and cultivation quite similar to the
                                regions in the same latitude on the Malay peninsula.</p>
                            <p>Of the islands in the Bay of Bengal the Nicobar and Andaman groups are alone worth notice. They are placed on a line joining the
                                north end of Sumatra and Cape Negrais, the south-western extremity of Burma. They possibly owe their existence to the volcanic
                                agencies which are known to extend from Sumatra across this part of the Indian Ocean.</p>

                            <p>The portion of Asia west of British India, excluding Arabia and Syria, forms another extensive plateau covering an area as large
                                as that of Tibet, though at a much lower altitude. Its southern border runs along the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Tigris,
                                and thence westward to the north-east angle of the Levant; on the north the high land follows nearly 36º N. to the southern
                                shore of the Caspian, and thence to the Black Sea and Sea of Marmora. Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Iran or Persia, Armenia and the
                                provinces of Asia Minor occupy this high region, with which they are nearly conterminous. The eastern flank of this tableland
                                follows a line of hills drawn a short distance from the Indus, between the mouth of that river and the Himalaya, about on the
                                72nd meridian; these hills do not generally exceed 4000 or 5000 ft. in elevation, but a few of the summits reach 10,000 ft. or
                                more. The southern and south-western face follows the coast closely up the Persian Gulf from the mouth of the Indus, and is
                                formed farther west by the mountain scarp, which, rising in many points to 10,000 ft., flanks the Tigris and the Mesopotamian
                                plains, and extends along Kurdistan and Armenia nearly to the 40th meridian ; beyond which it turns along the Taurus range, and
                                the north - eastern angle of the Mediterranean. The north - eastern portion of the Afghan tableland abuts on the Himalaya and
                                Tibet, with which it forms a continuous mass of mountain between the 71st and 72nd meridians, and 34° and 36º N. From the point
                                of intersection of the 71st meridian with the 36th parallel of latitude, an unbroken range of mountain stretches on one side
                                towards the north-east, up to the crest of the northern slope of the Tibetan plateau, and on the other nearly due west as far as
                                the Caspian. The north-eastern portion of this range is of great altitude, and separates the headwaters of the Oxus, which run
                                off to the Aral Sea, from those of the Indus and its Kabul tributary, which, uniting below Peshawar, are thence discharged
                                southward into the Arabian Sea. The western part of the range, which received the name of Paropamisus Mons from the ancients,
                                diminishes in height west of the 65th meridian and constitutes the northern face of the Afghan and Persian plateau, rising
                                abruptly from the plains of the Turkoman desert, which lies between the Oxus and the Caspian. These mountains at some points
                                attain a height of 10,000 or 12,000 ft. Along the south coast of the Caspian this line of elevation is prolonged as the Elburz
                                range (not to be confused with t h e Elburz of the Caucasus), and has its culminating point in Demavend, which rises to 19,400
                                ft. above the sea ; thence it extends to the north-west to Ararat, which rises to upwards of 17,000 ft., from the vicinity of
                                which the Euphrates flows off to the south-west, across the high lands of Armenia. Below the north-east declivity of this range
                                lies Georgia, on the other side of which province rises the Caucasus, the boundary of Asia and Europe between the Caspian and
                                Black Seas, the highest points of which reach an elevation of nearly 19,000 ft. West of Ararat high hills extend along the Black
                                Sea, between which and the Taurus range lies the plateau of Asia Minor, reaching to the Aegean Sea ; the mountains along the
                                Black Sea, on which are the Olympus and Ida of the ancients, rise to 6000 or 7000 ft. ; the Taurus is more lofty, reaching 8000
                                and 10,000 ft. ; both ranges decline in altitude as they approach the Mediterranean.</p>
                            <p>This great plateau, extending from the Mediterranean to the Indus, has a length of about 2500 m. from east to west, and a breadth
                                of upwards of 600 m. on the west and nowhere of less than 250 m. It lies generally at altitudes between 2000 ft. and 8000 ft.
                                above the sea-level. Viewed as a whole, the eastern half of this region, comprising Persia, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, is poor
                                and unproductive. The climate is very severe in the winter and extremely hot in summer. The rainfall is very scanty, and running
                                waters are hardly known, excepting among the mountains which form the scarps of the elevated country. The population is sparse,
                                frequently nomadic and addicted to plunder ; progress in the arts and habits of civilization is small. The western part of the
                                area falls within <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Turkish empire</name>. Its
                                climate is less hot and arid, its natural productiveness much greater, and its population more settled and on the whole more
                                advanced.</p>

                            <p>The peninsula of Arabia, with Syria, its continuation to the northwest has some of the characteristics of the hottest and driest
                                parts of Persia and Baluchistan. Excepting the northern part of this tract, which is conterminous with the plain of Mesopotamia
                                (which at its highest point reaches an elevation of about 700 ft. above the sea), the country is covered with low mountains,
                                rising to 3000 or 4000 ft. in altitude, having among them narrow valleys in which the vegetation is scanty, with exceptional
                                regions of greater fertility in the neighbourhood of the coasts, where the rainfall is greatest. In northern Syria the mountains
                                of Lebanon rise to about 10,000 ft., and with a more copious water supply the country becomes more productive. The whole tract,
                                excepting south-eastern Arabia, is nominally subject to Turkey, but the people are to no small extent practically independent,
                                living a nomadic, pastoral and freebooting life under petty chiefs, in the more arid districts, but settled in towns in the more
                                fertile tracts, where agriculture becomes more profitable and external commerce is established.</p>

                            <p>The area between the northern border of the Persian high lands and the Caspian and Aral Seas is a nearly desert low-lying plain,
                                extending to the foot of the north-western extremity of the great Tibeto-Himalayan mountains, and prolonged eastward up the
                                valleys of the Oxus (Amu-Darya) and Jaxartes (Syr-Darya), and northward across the country of the Kirghiz to the south-western
                                border of Siberia. It includes Bokhara, Khiva and Turkestan proper, in which the Uzbeg Turks are dominant, and for the most part
                                is inhabited by nomadic tribes, who are marauders, enjoying the reputation of being the worst among a race of professed robbers.
                                The tribes to the north, subject to Russia, are naturally more peaceable, and have been brought into some degree of discipline.
                                In this tract the rainfall is nowhere sufficient for the purposes of agriculture, which is only possible by help of irrigation ;
                                and the fixed population (which contains a non-Turkish element) is comparatively small, and restricted to the towns and the

                            <p>The north-western extremity of the elevated Tibeto-Himalayan mountain plateau is situated about on 73° E. and 39° N. This region
                                is known as Pamir; it has all the characteristics of the highest regions of Tibet, and so far fitly receives the Russian

                            <p>From the western end of the Yablonoi range, on the 115th meridian, a mountainous belt extends along a somewhat irregular line to
                                the extremity of Pamir, known under various names in its different parts, and broken up into several branches, enclosing among
                                them many isolated drainage areas, from which there is no outflow, and within which numerous lakes are formed. The most
                                important of these ranges is the Tian-shan or Celestial Mountains, which form the northern boundary of the Gobi desert; they lie
                                between 40° and 43° N., and between 75º and 95º E., and some of the summits are said to exceed 20,000 ft. in altitude ; along
                                the foot of this range are the principal cultivated districts of central Asia, and here too are situated the few towns which
                                have sprung up in this barren and thinly peopled region. Next may be named the Ala-tau, on the prolongation of the Tian-shan,
                                flanking the Syr on the north, and rising to 14,000 or 15,000 ft. It forms the barrier between the Issyk-kul and Balkash lakes,
                                the elevation of which is about 5000 ft. Last is the Altai, near the 50th parallel, rising to 10,000 or 12,000 ft., which
                                separates the waters of the great rivers of western Siberia from those that collect into the lakes of northwest Mongolia,
                                Dzungaria and Kalka. A line of elevation is continued west of the Altai to the Ural Mountains, not rising to considerable
                                altitudes; this divides the drainage of south-west Siberia from the great plains lying north-east of the Aral Sea.</p>
                            <p>The central area bounded on the north and north-west by the Yablonoi Mountains and their western extension in the Tian-shan, on
                                the south by the northern face of the Tibetan plateau, and on the east by the Khingan range before alluded to, forms the great
                                desert of central Asia, known as the Gobi. Its eastern part is nearly conterminous with south Mongolia, its western forms
                                Chinese or eastern Turkestan. It appears likely that no part of this great central Asiatic desert is less than 2000 ft. above
                                the sea-level. The elevation of the plain about Kashgar and Yarkand is from 4000 to 6000 ft. The more northern parts of Mongolia
                                are between 4000 and 6000 ft., and no portion of the route across the desert between the Chinese frontier and Kiakhta is below
                                3000 ft. The precise positions of the mountain ridges that traverse this central area are not properly known ; their elevation
                                is everywhere considerable, and many points are known to exceed 10,000 or 12,000 ft.</p>
                            <p>In Mongolia the population is essentially nomadic, its wealth consisting in herds of horned cattle, sheep, horses and camels. The
                                Turki tribes, occupying western Mongolia, are among the least civilized of human beings, and it is chiefly to their extreme
                                barbarity and cruelty that our ignorance of central Asia is due. The climate is very severe, with great extremes of heat and
                                cold. The drought is very great; rain falls rarely and in small quantities. The surface is for the most part a hard stony
                                desert, areas of blown sand occurring but exceptionally. There are few towns or settled villages, except <pb n="738" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0738.png"/> along the
                                slopes of the higher mountains, on which the rain falls more abundantly, or the melting snow supplies streams for irrigation. It
                                is only in such situations that cultivated lands are found, and beyond them trees are hardly to be seen.</p>

                            <p>The portion of Asia which lies between the Arctic Ocean and the mountainous belt bounding Manchuria, Mongolia and Turkestan on
                                the north is Siberia. It includes an immense high and broken plateau which spreads from south-west to north-east, losing in
                                width and altitude as it advances north-east. It is fringed on either side by high border ridges, which subside on the
                                north-west into a stretch of high plains, 1500 to 2000 ft. high, finally dropping to lowlands a few hundred feet above
                                sea-level. The extremes of heat and cold are very great. The rainfall, though not heavy, is sufficient to maintain such
                                vegetation as is compatible with the conditions of temperature, and the surface is often swampy or peaty. The mountain-sides are
                                commonly clothed with pine forests, and the plains with grasses or shrubs. The population is very scanty ; the cultivated tracts
                                are comparatively small in extent and restricted to the more settled districts. The towns are entirely Russian. The indigenous
                                races are nomadic Mongols, of a peaceful character, but in a very backward state of civilization. The Ural Mountains do not
                                exceed 2000 or 3000 ft. in average altitude, the highest summits not exceeding 6000 ft., and one of the passes being as low as
                                3400 ft. In the southern half of the range are the chief mining districts of Russia. The Ob, Yenisei and Lena, which traverse
                                Siberia, are among the largest rivers in the world.</p>

                                E., and from 5° to 10° S. The central part of the group is a volcanic region, many of the volcanoes being still active, the
                                summits frequently rising to 10,000 ft. or more.</p>
                            <p>Sumatra, the largest of the islands, is but thinly peopled ; the greater part of the surface is covered with dense forest, the
                                cultivated area being comparatively small, confined to the low lands, and chiefly in the volcanic region near the centre of the
                                island. Java is the most thickly peopled, best cultivated and most advanced island of the whole Eastern archipelago. It has
                                attained a high degree of wealth and prosperity under the Dutch government. The people are peaceful and industrious, and chiefly
                                occupied with agriculture. The highest of the volcanic peaks rises to 12,000 ft. above the sea. The eastern islands of this
                                group are less productive and less advanced.</p>

                                Guinea or Papua, is but little known. The population is small, rude and uncivilized ; and the surface is rough and mountainous

                                various surrounding countries. The highest mountain rises to nearly 14,000 ft., but the ordinary elevations do not exceed 4000
                                or 5000 ft.</p>

                                Torres Straits. Very little is known of the interior. The mountains are said to rise to 20,000 ft., having the appearance of
                                being permanently covered with snow ; the surface seems generally to be clothed with thick wood. The inhabitants are of the
                                Negrito type, with curly or crisp and bushy hair ; those of the west coast have come more into communication with the traders of
                                other islands and are fairly civilized. Eastward, many of the tribes are barbarous savages.</p>
                            <p>The Philippine Islands lie between 5° and 20º N., between Borneo and southern China. The highest land does not rise to a greater
                                height than 10,250 ft. ; the climate is well suited for agriculture, and the islands generally are fertile and fairly
                                cultivated, though not coming up to the standard of Java either in wealth or population.</p>
                            <p>Formosa, which is situated under the northern tropic, near the coast of China, is traversed by a high range of mountains,
                                reaching nearly 13,000 ft. in elevation. On its western side, which is occupied by an immigrant Chinese population, are open and
                                well-cultivated plains ; on the east it is mountainous, and occupied by independent indigenous tribes in a less advanced
                                state.</p>
                            <p>The islands of Japan, not including Sakhalin, of which half is Japanese, lie between the 30th and 45th parallels. The whole group
                                is traversed by a line of volcanic mountains, some of which are in activity, the highest point being about 13,000 ft. above the
                                sea. The country is generally well watered, fertile and well cultivated. The Japanese people have added to their ancient
                                civilization and their remarkable artistic faculty, an adaptation of Western methods, and a capacity for progress in war and
                                commerce, which single them out among Eastern races as a great modern world-force.</p>

                                <p>The progress of geodetic surveys in Russia had long ago extended across the European half of the great empire, St Petersburg
                                    being connected with Tiflis on the southern slopes of the Caucasus by a direct system of triangulation carried out with the
                                    highest scientific precision. St Petersburg, again, is connected with Greenwich by European systems of triangulation; and
                                    the Greenwich meridian is adopted by Russia as the zero for all her longitude values. But beyond the eastern shores of the
                                    Caspian no system of direct geodetic measurement by first-class triangulation has been possible, and the surveys of Asiatic
                                    Russia are separated from those of Europe by the width of that inland sea. The arid nature of the trans-Caspian deserts has
                                    proved an insuperable obstacle to those rigorous methods of geodetic survey which distinguish Russian methods in Europe, so
                                    that Russian geography in central Asia is dependent on other means than that of direct measurement for the co-ordinate
                                    values in latitude and longitude for any given point. The astronomical observatory at Tashkent is adopted for the initial
                                    starting-point of the trans-Caspian triangulation of Russia ; the triangulation ranks as second-class only, and now extends
                                    to the Pamir frontier beyond Osh. The longitude of the Tashkent observatory has been determined by telegraph differentially

                                    further and more rigorous application of the telegraphic method of determining longitudes differentially with Greenwich has
                                    resulted in a slight correction (amounting to about 2" of arc) to the previous determination by the same method through
                                    Suez. This last determination was effected through four arcs as follows :— <list>
                                        <item>I. Greenwich—Potsdam.</item>
                                        <item>II. Potsdam—Teheran.</item>
                                        <item>III. Teheran—Bushire.</item>
                                        <item>IV. Bushire—Karachi.</item>
                                    </list> Each arc was measured with every precaution and a multitude of observations. The only element of uncertainty was
                                    caused by the retardation of the current, which between Potsdam and Teheran (3000 m.) took 08-20 to travel; but it is
                                    probable that the final value can be accepted as correct to within 08-05.</p>
                                <p>The final result of this latest determination is to place the Madras observatory 2' 27" to the west of the position adopted
                                    for it on the strength of absolute astronomical determinations.</p>

                                    by the direct process of earth measurement, a topographical connexion has been effected between Russian and Indian surveys
                                    which sufficiently proves that the deductive methods employed by both countries for the determination of the co-ordinate
                                    values of fixed points so far agree that, for all practical purposes of future Asiatic cartography, no difficulty in

                                    been pushed outwards on all sides. They reach through Afghanistan and Baluchistan to the eastern districts of Persia, and
                                    along the coast of Makran to that of Arabia. They have long ago included the farther mountain peaks of Nepal, and they now
                                    branch outwards towards western China and into Siam. These far extensions furnish the basis for a vast amount of exploratory
                                    survey of a strictly geographical character, and they have contributed largely towards raising the standard of accuracy in
                                    Asiatic geographical surveys to a level which was deemed unattainable fifty years ago. There is yet a vast field open in
                                    Asia for this class of surveys. While at the close of the 19th century western Asia (exclusive of Arabia) may be said to
                                    have been freed from all geographical perplexity, China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia still include enormous areas of which
                                    geographical knowledge is in a primitive stage of nebulous uncertainty.</p>

                                    that it is only possible to refer in barest outline to some of the principal expeditions, most of which have been directed
                                    either to the great elevated tableland of Tibet or to the central depression which exists to the north of it. In southern
                                    Tibet the trans-Himalayan explorations of the native surveyors attached to the Indian survey, notably Pundits <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nain_Singh_Rawat">Nain Singh</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krishna_Singh">Krishna</name>, added largely to our knowledge of the great plateau.

                                    Indus and of the Upper Brahmaputra in the years 1865-1867 ; and in 1874-1875 he followed a line from the eastern frontiers
                                    of Kashmir to the Tengri Nor lake and thence to Lhasa, in which city he remained for some months. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Krishna_Singh">Krishna</name>'s remarkable journey in 1879-1882 extended from Lhasa

                                    the town of Darchendo, or Tachienlu, on the high road between Lhasa and Peking, and on the borders of China. Failing to
                                    reach India through Upper Assam he returned to the neighbourhood of Lhasa, and crossed the Himalayas by a more westerly
                                    route. Both these explorers visited Lhasa.</p>

                                    Tsaidam, and mapped the hydrography of that remarkable region, from which emanate the great rivers of China, Siam and Burma.
                                    He penetrated southwards to within a month's march of Lhasa. In 1876 he visited the Lop Nor and discovered the Altyn Tagh
                                    range. In 1879 he followed up the Urangi river to the Altai Mountains, and demonstrated to the world the extraordinary

                                    and the Salween, and then returned to Russia. His fourth journey in 1883-1885 was to Sining (the great trade centre of the
                                    Chinese borderland), and thence through northern Tibet (crossing the Altyn Tagh to Lop Nor), and by the Cherchen-Keriya
                                    trade route to Khotan. From Khotan he followed the Tarim to Aksu.</p>

                                <p>No longer do we regard the Kuen-lun mountains, which extend from the frontiers of Kashmir, north of Leh, almost due east to
                                    the Chinese province of Kansu, as the southern limit of the Gobi or Turkestan depression. This very remarkable longitudinal
                                    chain is undoubtedly the northern limit of the Chang Tang, the elevated highland steppes of Tibet; but from it there
                                    branches a minor system to the north-east from a point in about 830 E. longitude, which culminates in the Altyn Tagh, and
                                    extends eastwards in a continuous water-divide to the Nan Shan mountains, north of the Koko Nor basin. Thus between Tibet
                                    and the low-lying sands of Gobi we have, thrust in, a system of elevated valleys (Tsaidam), 8000 to 9000 ft. above
                                    sea-level, forming an intermediate steppe between the highest regions and the lowest, east of Lop Nor. All this is
                                    comparatively new geography, and it goes far to explain why the great trade routes from Peking to the west were pushed so
                                    far to the north.</p>

                                    desert to Lop Nor and the Gobi has yielded up many interesting secrets. The remarkable phenomenon of the periodic shifting
                                    of the Lop Nor system has been revealed by the researches of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sven_Hedin">Sven Hedin</name>, and the former existence of highly civilized centres of
                                    Buddhist art and industry in the now sand-strewn wastes of the Turkestan desert has been clearly demonstrated by the same

                                    investigation of Russian scientists, with the result that the theory of an ancient connexion between the Oxus and the
                                    Caspian has been displaced by the more recent hypothesis of an extension of the Caspian Sea eastwards into Trans-Caspian
                                    territory within the post- Pleiocene age. The discovery of shells (now living in the Caspian} at a distance of about 100 m.
                                    inland, at an altitude of 140 to 280 ft. above the present level of the Caspian, gives support to this hypothesis, which is
                                    further advanced by the ascertained nature of the Kara-kum sands, which appear to be a purely marine formation exhibiting no
                                    traces of fluviatile deposits which might be considered as delta deposits of the Oxus.</p>

                                    Further matter of interest in connexion with the Oxus basin was elucidated by the researches of <name type="person">L.
                                        Griesbach</name> in connexion with <name type="institution">the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission</name>. He reported the
                                    gradual formation of an anticlinal or ridge extending longitudinally through the great Balkh plain of Afghan Turkestan,
                                    which effectually shuts off the northern affluents of that basin from actual junction with the river. This evidence of a
                                    gradual process of upheaval still in action may throw some light on the physical (especially the climatic) changes which
                                    must have passed over that part of Asia since Balkh was the <q>" mother of cities,"</q> the great trade centre of Asia, and

                                    wilderness that divides Tibet and Burma from China. In this field the researches of travellers already mentioned, combined

                                    the interests of commercial projects, have left little to future inquiry. We know now for certain that the great Tsanpo of
                                    Tibet and the Brahmaputra are one and the same river; that north of the point where the great countermarch of that river
                                    from east to west is effected are to be found the sources of the Salween, the Mekong, the Yang-tsze-kiang and the Hwang-ho,
                                    or Yellow river, in order, from west to east ; and that south of it, thrust in between the extreme eastern edge of the

                                    separates the most eastern affluent of the Brahmaputra, eastwards to the deep gorges which enclose the most westerly branch
                                    of the upper Yang-tsze-kiang (here running from north to south), is a short space of 100 m. ; and within that space two
                                    mighty rivers, the Salween and the Mekong, send down their torrents to Burma and Siam. These three rivers flow parallel to
                                    each other for some 300 m., deep hidden in narrow and precipitous troughs, amidst some of the grandest scenery of Asia ;
                                    spreading apart where the Yang-tsze takes its course eastwards, not far north of the parallel of 25º.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">Modern Boundary Demarcation</hi>.—The period from about 1880 has been an era of boundary-making in Asia, of
                                    defining the politico-geographical limits of empire, and of determining the responsibilities of government. Russia, Persia,
                                    Afghanistan, Baluchistan, India and China have all revised their borders, and with the revision the political relations
                                    between these countries have acquired a new and more assured basis. See also the articles on the different countries. We are
                                    not here concerned with understandings as to <q>" spheres of influence,"</q> or with arrangements such as the Anglo- Russian
                                    Convention of 1907 concerning Persia.</p>

                                <p>The advance of Russia to the Turkoman deserts and the Oxus demanded a definite boundary between her trans-Caspian conquests
                                    and the kingdom of Afghanistan. This was determined on the north-west by <name type="institution">the Russo-Afghan Boundary
                                        Commission</name> of 1884-I886. A boundary was then fixed between the Hari Rud (the river of Herat) and the Oxus, which
                                    is almost entirely artificial in its construction. Zulfikar, where the boundary leaves the Hari Rud, is about 70 m. south of
                                    Sarakhs, and the most southerly point of the boundary (where it crosses the Kushk) is about 60 m. north of Herat. From the
                                    junction of the boundary with the Oxus at Khamiab about 150 m. above the crossing-point of the Russian Trans-Caspian railway
                                    at Charjui, the main channel of the Oxus river becomes the northern boundary of Afghanistan, separating that country from
                                    Russia, and so continues to its source in Victoria Lake of the Great Pamir. Beyond this point <name type="institution">the
                                        Anglo-Russian Commission</name> of 1895 demarcated a line to the snowfields and glaciers which overlook the Chinese
                                    border. Between the Russian Pamirs and Chinese Turkestan the rugged line of the Sarikol range intervenes, the actual
                                    dividing line being still indefinite. Beyond Kashgar the southern boundary of Siberia follows an irregular course to the
                                    north-east, partly defined by the Tian-shan and Alatau mountains, till it attains a northerly point in about 53° N. lat.
                                    marked by the Sayan range to the west of Irkutsk. It then deflects south-east till it touches the Kerulen affluent of the
                                    Amur river at a point which is shown in unofficial maps as about 117º 30'E. long, and 49º 20' N. lat. From here it follows
                                    this affluent to its junction with the Amur river, and the Amur river to its junction with the Usuri. It follows the Usuri
                                    to its head (its direction now being a little west of south), and finally strikes the Pacific coast on about 42º 30' N. lat.
                                    at the month of the Tumen river 100 m. south of the Amur bay, at the head of which lies the Russian port of Vladivostok. At
                                    two points the Russian boundary nearly approaches that of provinces which are directly under British suzerainty. Where the
                                    Oxus river takes its great bend to the north from Ishkashim, the breadth of the Afghan territory intervening between that
                                    river and the main water-divide of the Hindu Kush is not more than 10 or 12 m. ; and east of the Pamir extension of
                                    Afghanistan, where the Beyik Pass crosses the Sarikol range and drops into the Taghdumbash Pamir, there is but the narrow
                                    width of the Karachukar valley between the Sarikol and the Muztagh. Here, however, the boundary is again undefined.
                                    Eastwards of this the great Kashgar depression, which includes the Tarim desert, separates Russia from the vast sterile
                                    highlands of Tibet; and a continuous series of desert spaces of low elevation, marking the limits of a primeval inland sea
                                    from the Sarikol meridional watershed to the Khingan mountains on the western borders of Manchuria, divide her from the
                                    northern provinces of China. From the Khingan ranges to the Pacific, south of the Amur, stretch the rich districts of
                                    Manchuria, a province which connects Russia with the Korea by a series of valleys formed by the Sungari and its affluents—a
                                    land of hill and plain, forest and swamp, possessing a delightful climate, and vast undeveloped agricultural resources.
                                    Throughout this land of promise Russian influence was destroyed by Japan in the war of 1904. The possession of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lüshunkou_District">Port Arthur</name>, and direct political control over
                                    Korea, place Japan in the dominant position as regards Manchuria.</p>

                                <p>Coincident with the demarcation of Russian boundaries in Turkestan was that of northern Afghanistan. From the Hari Rud on the
                                    west to the Sarikol mountains on the east her northern Afghan limits were set by <name type="institution">the Boundary
                                        Commissions</name> of 1884-1886 and of 1895 respectively. Her southern and eastern boundaries were further defined by a
                                    series of minor commissions, working on the basis of the Kabul agreement of 1893, which lasted for nearly four years,
                                    terminating with the Mohmand settlement at the close of an expedition in 1897.</p>
                                <p>The Pamir extension of Afghan territory to the north-east reaches to a point a little short of 75° E., from whence it follows
                                    the waterdivide to the head of the Taghdumbash Pamir, and is thenceforward defined by the water-parting of the Hindu Kush.
                                    It leaves the Hindu Kush near the Dorah Pass at the head of one of the minor Chitral affluents, and passing south-west
                                    divides Kafiristan from Chitral and Bajour, separates the sections of the Mohmands who are within the respective spheres of
                                    Afghan and British sovereignty, and crosses the Peshawar-Kabul route at Lundi-Khana. It thus places a broad width of
                                    independent territory between the boundaries of British India (which have remained practically, though not absolutely,
                                    untouched) and Afghanistan; and this independent belt includes Swat, Bajour and a part of the Mohmand territory north of the
                                    Kabul river. The same principle of maintaining an intervening width of neutral territory between the two countries is
                                    definitely established throughout the eastern borders of Afghanistan, along the full length of which a definite boundary has
                                    been demarcated to the point where it touches the northern limits of Baluchistan on the Gomal river. From the Gomal
                                    Baluchistan itself becomes an intervening state between British India and Afghanistan, and the dividing line between
                                    Baluchistan and Afghanistan is laid down with all the precision employed on the more northerly sections of the
                                    demarcation.</p>

                                    Baluchistan independence demands qualification. There is British Baluchistan <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    is everywhere subject to British control. British Baluchistan officially includes the districts of Peshin, Sibi and of
                                    Thal-Chotiali. As these districts had originally been Afghan, they were transferred to British authority by the treaty of
                                    Gandamak in 1879, although nominally they had been handed over to Kalat forty years previously. Now they form an official
                                    province of British Baluchistan within <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluchistan_Agency">the
                                        Baluchistan Agency</name>; and the agency extends from the Gomal to the Arabian Sea and the Persian frontier. Within
                                    this agency there are districts as independent as any in Afghanistan, but the political status of the province as a whole is
                                    almost precisely that of the native states of the Indian peninsula. The agent to the governor-general of India, with a staff
                                    of political assistants, practically exercises supreme control.</p>

                                    west, she has touched another on the east. The Mekong river which limits British interests in Burma limits also those of
                                    France in Tongking. The eastern boundaries of Burma are not yet fully demarcated on the Chinese frontier. At a point level
                                    in latitude with Mogaung, near the northern termination of the Burmese railway system, this boundary is defined by the
                                    eastern watershed of the Nmaikha, the eastern of the two great northern affluents of the Irrawaddy. Then it follows an
                                    irregular course southwards to a position south-east of Bhamo in lat. 24º. It next defines the northern edge of the Shan
                                    States, and finally strikes the Mekong river in lat. 21º 45' (approximately). From that point southwards the river becomes
                                    the boundary between the Shan States and Tongking for some 200 m., the channel of the river defining the limits of
                                    occupation (though not entirely of interest) between French and British subjects. Approximately on the parallel of 20º N.
                                    lat. the Burmese boundary leaves the Mekong to run westwards towards the Salween, and thereafter following the eastern
                                    watershed of the Salween basin it divides the Lower Burma provinces from Siam.</p>

                                <p>The total area of Asia, continental and insular, is therefore somewhat over 16,819,000 sq. m. (but various authorities differ
                                    considerably in their detailed estimates). The population may be set down roughly as 823,000,000, of which 330,000,000
                                    inhabit Chinese territory, 302,000,000 British, and 25,000,000 Russian.</p>

                                <p>The geology of Asia is so complex and over wide areas so little known that it is difficult to give a connected account of
                                    either the structure or the development of the continent, and only the broader features can be dealt with here.</p>
                                <p>In the south, in Syria, Arabia and the peninsula of India, none but the oldest rocks are folded, and the Upper Palaeozoic,
                                    the Mesozoic and the Tertiary beds lie almost horizontally upon them. It is a region of quiescence or of faulting, but not
                                    of folding. North of this lies a broad belt in which the Mesozoic deposits and even the lower divisions of the Tertiary
                                    system are thrown into folds which extend in a series of arcs from west to east and now form the principal mountain ranges
                                    of central Asia. This belt includes Asia Minor, Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, the Himalayas, the Tian-shan, and,
                                    although they are very different in direction, the Burmese ranges. The Kuen-lun, Nan-shan and the mountain ranges of
                                    southern China are, perhaps, of earlier date, but nevertheless they lie in the same belt. It is not true that throughout the
                                    whole width of this zone the beds are folded. There are considerable tracts which are but little disturbed, but these tracts
                                    are enclosed within the arcs formed by the folds, and the zone taken as a whole is distinctly one of crumpling. North of the
                                    folded belt, and including the greater part of Siberia, Mongolia and northern China, lies another area which is, in general,
                                    free from any important folding of Mesozoic or Tertiary age. There are, it is true, mountain ranges which are formed of
                                    folded beds, but in many cases the direction of the chains is different from that of the folds, so that the ranges must owe
                                    their elevation to other causes; and the folds, moreover, are of ancient date, for the most part Archaean or Palaeozoic. The
                                    configuration of the region is largely due to faulting, trough-like or tray-like depressions being formed, and the
                                    intervening strips, which have not been depressed, standing up as mountain ridges. Over a large part of Siberia and in the
                                    north of China, even the Cambrian beds still he as horizontally as they were first laid down. In the extreme north, in the
                                    Verkhoyansk range and in the mountains of the Taimyr peninsula, there are indications of another zone of folding of Mesozoic
                                    or later date, but our information concerning these ranges is very scanty. Besides the three chief regions into which the
                                    mainland is thus seen to be divided, attention should be drawn to the festoons of islands which border the eastern side of
                                    the continent, and which are undoubtedly due to causes similar to those which produced the folds of the folded belt.</p>
                                <p>Of all the Asiatic ranges the Himalayan is, geologically, the best known ; and the evidence which it affords shows clearly
                                    that the folds to which it owes its elevation were produced by an overthrust <pb n="743" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0743.png"/> from the north. It is, indeed, as
                                    if the high land of central Asia had been pushed southward against and over the unyielding mass formed by the old rocks of
                                    the Indian peninsula, and in the process the edges of the over-riding strata had been crumpled and folded. Overlooking all
                                    smaller details, we may consider Asia to consist of a northern mass and a southern mass, too rigid to crumple, but not too
                                    strong to fracture, and an intermediate belt of softer rock which was capable of folding. If then by the contraction of the
                                    earth's interior the outer crust were forced to accommodate itself to a smaller nucleus, the central softer belt would yield
                                    by crumpling; the more rigid masses to the north and south, if they gave way at all, would yield by faulting. It is
                                    interesting to observe, as will be shown later, that during the Mesozoic era there was a land-mass in the north of Asia and
                                    another in the south, and between them lay the sea in which ordinary marine sediments were deposited. The belt of folding
                                    does not precisely coincide with this central sea, but the correspondence is fairly close.</p>
                                <p>The present outline of the eastern coast and the nearly enclosed seas which lie between the islands and the mainland, are
                                    attributed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_von_Richthofen">Richthofen</name> chiefly to
                                    simple faulting.</p>
                                <p>Little is known of the early geological history of Asia beyond the fact that a large part of the continent was covered by the
                                    sea during the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. But there is positive evidence that much of the north and east of Asia has
                                    been land since the Palaeozoic era, and it has been conclusively proved that the peninsula of India has never been beneath
                                    the sea since the Carboniferous period at least. Between these ancient land masses lies an area in which marine deposits of
                                    Mesozoic age are well developed and which was evidently beneath the sea during the greater part of the Mesozoic era. The
                                    northern land-mass has been named <name type="place">Angaraland</name> by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">E. Suess</name> ; the southern, of which the Indian peninsula is but a
                                    fragment, is called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name> by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melchior_Neumayr">Neumayr</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name> and others ; while the intervening sea is the central
                                    Mediterranean sea of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melchior_Neumayr">Neumayr</name> and <name type="place">the Tethys</name> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name>. The
                                    greater part of western Asia, including the basin of the Obi, the drainage area of the Aral Sea, together with Afghanistan,
                                    Baluchistan, Persia and Arabia, was covered by the sea during the later stages of the Cretaceous period ; but a considerable
                                    part of this region was probably dry land in Jurassic times.</p>
                                <p>The northern land-mass begins in the north with the area which lies between the Yenisei and the Lena. Here the folded Archean
                                    rocks are overlaid by Cambrian and Ordovician beds, which still lie for the most part flat and undisturbed. Upon these rest
                                    patches of freshwater deposits containing numerous remains of plants. They consist chiefly of sandstone and conglomerate,
                                    but include workable seams of coal. Some of the deposits appear to be of Permian age, but others are probably Jurassic ; and
                                    they are all included under the general name of the Angara series. Excepting in the extreme north, where marine Jurassic and
                                    Cretaceous fossils have been found, there is no evidence that this part of Siberia has been beneath the sea since the early
                                    part of the Palaeozoic era. Besides the plant beds extensive outflows of basic lava rest directly upon the Cambrian and
                                    Ordovician strata. The date of these eruptions is still uncertain, but they probably continued to a very recent period.</p>
                                <p>South and east of the Palaeozoic plateau is an extensive area consisting chiefly of Archean rocks, and including the greater
                                    part of Mongolia north of the Tian-shan. Here again there are no marine beds of Mesozoic or Tertiary age, while
                                    plant-bearing deposits belonging to the Angara series are known. Structurally, the folds of this region are of ancient date
                                    ; but the area is crossed by a series of depressions formed by faults, and the intervening strips, which have not been
                                    depressed to the same extent, now stand up as mountain ranges. Farther south, in the Chinese provinces of Shansi and Shensi,
                                    the geological succession is similar in some respects to that of the Siberian Palaeozoic plateau, but the sequence is more
                                    complete. There is again a floor of folded Archean rocks overlaid by nearly horizontal strata of Lower Palaeozoic age; but
                                    these are followed by marine beds belonging to the Carboniferous period. From the Upper Carboniferous onward, however, no
                                    marine deposits are known; and, as in Siberia, plant-bearing beds are met with. Southern China is very different in
                                    structure, consisting largely of folded mountain chains, but the geological succession is very similar, and excepting near
                                    the Tibetan and Burmese borders, there are no marine deposits of Mesozoic or Tertiary age.</p>
                                <p>Thus it appears that from the Arctic Ocean there stretches a broad area as far as the south of China, in which no marine
                                    deposits of later date than Carboniferous have yet been found, except in the extreme north. Freshwater and terrestrial
                                    deposits of Mesozoic age occur in many places, and the conclusion is irresistible that the greater part of this area has
                                    been land since the close of the Palaeozoic era. The Triassic deposits of the Verkhoyansk Range show that this land did not
                                    extend to the Bering Sea ; while the marine Mesozoic deposits of Japan on the east, the western Tian-shan on the west and
                                    Tibet on the south give us some idea of its limits in other directions.</p>
                                <p>In the same way the entire absence of any marine fossils in the peninsula of India, excepting near its borders, and the
                                    presence of the terrestrial and freshwater deposits of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwana</name> series, representing the whole of the geological scale from the top of the Carboniferous to the top of
                                    the Jurassic, show that this region also has been land since the Carboniferous period. It was a portion of a great land-mass
                                    which probably extended across the Indian Ocean and was at one time united with the south of Africa.</p>
                                <p>But these two land-masses were not connected. Between India and China there is a broad belt in which marine deposits of
                                    Mesozoic and Tertiary age are well developed. Marine Tertiary beds occur in Burma ; in the Himalayas and in south Tibet
                                    there is a nearly complete series of marine deposits from the Carboniferous to the Eocene ; in Afghanistan the Mesozoic beds
                                    are in part marine and in part fluviatile. The sea in which these strata were deposited seems to have attained its greatest
                                    extension in Upper Cretaceous times, when its waters spread over the whole of western Asia and even encroached slightly upon
                                    the Indian land. The Eocene sea, however, cannot have been much inferior in extent.</p>
                                <p>It was after the Eocene period that the main part of the elevation of the Himalayas took place, as is shown by the occurrence
                                    of nummulitic limestone at a height of 20,000 ft. The formation of this and of the other great mountain chains of central
                                    Asia resulted in the isolation of portions of the former central sea ; and the same forces finally led to the elevation of
                                    the whole region and the union of the old continents of <name type="place">Angara</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwana</name>. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name>, however, did not long survive, and the portion which lay
                                    between India and South Africa sank beneath the waves in Tertiary times.</p>
                                <p>Leaving out of consideration all evidence of more ancient volcanic activity, each of the three regions, into which, as we
                                    have seen, the continent may be divided, has been, during or since the Cretaceous period, the seat of great volcanic
                                    eruptions. In the southern region of unfolded beds are found the lavas of the <q>" harras "</q> of Arabia, and in India the
                                    extensive flows of the Deccan Trap. In the central folded belt lie the great volcanoes, now mostly extinct, of Asia Minor,
                                    Armenia, Persia and Baluchistan. In Burma also there is at least one extinct volcano. In the northern unfolded region great
                                    flows of basic lava lie directly upon the Cambrian and Ordovician beds of Siberia, but are certainly in part of Tertiary
                                    age. Similar flows on a smaller scale occur in Manchuria, Korea and northern China. In all these cases, however, the
                                    eruptions have now almost ceased; and the great volcanoes of the present day lie in the islands off the eastern and
                                    south-eastern coasts.</p>

                            <p>Among the places on the globe where the temperature falls lowest are some in northern Asia, and among those where it rises
                                highest are some in southern Asia. The mean temperature of the north coast of eastern Siberia is but a few degrees above the
                                zero of Fahrenheit; the lowest mean temperature anywhere observed is about 4º Fahr., at Melville Island, north of the American
                                continent. The isothermals of mean annual temperature lie over northern Asia on curves tolerably regular in their outline,
                                having their western branches in a somewhat higher latitude than their eastern ; a reduction of 1° of latitude corresponds
                                approximately—and irrespective of modifications due to elevation —to a rise of 1/2° Fahr., as far say as 30º N., where the mean
                                temperature is about 75° Fahr. Farther south the increase is slower, and the highest mean temperature anywhere attained in
                                southern Asia is not much above 82° Fahr.</p>
                            <p>The variations of temperature are very great in Siberia, amounting near the coast to more than 100° Fahr., between the mean of
                                the hottest and coldest months, and to still more between the extreme temperatures of those months. In southern Asia, and
                                particularly near the sea, the variation between the hottest and coldest monthly means is very much less, and under the equator
                                it is reduced to about 5º. In Siberia the difference between the means of the hottest and coldest months is hardly anywhere less
                                than 60° Fahr. On the Sea of Aral it is 80° Fahr. ; and at Astrakhan, on the Caspian, more than 50°. At Tiflis it is 45º. In
                                northern China, at Peking, it is 55°, reduced to 30° at Canton, and to 20º at Manila. In northern India the greatest difference
                                does not exceed 40°; and it falls off to about 15° at Calcutta, and to about 10° or 12° at Bombay and Madras. The temperatures
                                at the head of the Persian Gulf approximate to those of northern India, and those of Aden to Madras. At Singapore the range is
                                less than 5°; and at Batavia in Java, and Galle in Ceylon, it is about the same. The extreme temperatures in Siberia may be
                                considered to lie between 80° and 90º Fahr. for maxima, and between -40º and -70° Fahr. for minima. The extreme of heat near the
                                Caspian and Aral Seas rises to nearly 100° Fahr., while that of cold falls to -20º Fahr. or lower. Compared with these figures,
                                we find in southern Asia 110º or 112° Fahr. as a maximum hardly ever exceeded. The absolute minimum in northern India, in lat.
                                30º, hardly goes below 32° ; at Calcutta it is about 40º, though the thermometer seldom falls to 50°. At Madras it rarely falls
                                as low as 65°, or at Bombay below 60°. At Singapore and Batavia the thermometer very rarely falls below 70°, or rises above 90º.
                                At Aden the minimum is a few degrees below 70°, the maximum not much exceeding 90º.</p>

                            <p>These figures sufficiently indicate the main characteristics of the air temperatures of Asia. Throughout its northern portion the
                                winter is long and of extreme severity ; and even down to the circle of 35° N. lat., the minimum temperature is almost as low as
                                zero of Fahrenheit. The summers are hot, though short in the northern latitudes, the maximum of summer heat being comparatively
                                little less than that observed in the tropical countries farther south. The moderating effect of the proximity of the ocean is
                                felt in an important degree along the southern and eastern parts of Asia, where the land is broken up into islands or
                                peninsulas. The great elevations above the sea-level of the central part of Asia, and of the table-lands of Afghanistan and
                                Persia, tend to exaggerate the winter cold ; while the sterility of the surface, due to the small rainfall over the same region,
                                operates powerfully in the opposite direction in increasing the summer heat. In the summer a great accumulation of solar heat
                                takes place on the dry surface soil, from which it cannot be released upwards by evaporation, as might be the case were the soil
                                moist or covered with vegetation, nor can it be readily conveyed away downwards as happens on the ocean. In the winter similar
                                consequences ensue, in a negative direction, from the prolonged loss of heat by radiation in the long and clear nights—an effect
                                which is intensified wherever the surface is covered with snow, or the air little charged with vapour. In illustration of the
                                very slow diffusion of heat in the solid crust of the earth, and as affording a further indication of the climate of northern
                                Asia, reference may here be made to the frozen soil of Siberia, in the vicinity of Yakutsk. In this region the earth is frozen
                                permanently to a depth of more than 380 ft. at which the temperature is still 5º or 6° Fahr. below the freezing point of water,
                                the summer heat merely thawing the surface to a depth of about 3 ft. At a depth of 50 ft. the temperature is about 15º Fahr.
                                below the freezing point. Under such conditions of the soil, the land, nevertheless, produces crops of wheat and other grain
                                from fifteen to forty fold.</p>
                            <p>The very high summer temperatures of the area north of the tropic of Cancer are sufficiently accounted for, when compared with
                                those observed south of the tropic, by the increased length of the day in the higher latitude, which more than compensates for
                                the loss of heat due to the smaller mid-day altitude of the sun. The difference between the heating power of the sun's rays at
                                noon on the 21st of June, in latitude 20º and in latitude 45°, is only about 2 % ; while the accumulated heat received during
                                the day, which is lengthened to 15 1/2 hours in the higher latitude, is greater by about 11 % than in the lower latitude, where
                                the day consists only of 13 1/4 hours.</p>
                            <p>Although the foregoing account of the temperatures of Asia supplies the main outline of the observed phenomena, a very important
                                modifying cause, of which more will be said hereafter, comes into operation over the whole of the tropical region, namely, the
                                periodical summer rains. These tend very greatly to arrest the increase of the summer heat over the area where they prevail, and
                                otherwise give it altogether peculiar characteristics.</p>

                            <p>The great summer heat, by expanding the air upwards, disturbs the level of the planes of equal pressure, and causes an outflow of
                                the upper strata from the heated area. The winter cold produces an effect of just an opposite nature, and causes an accumulation
                                of air over the cold area. The diminution of barometric pressure which takes place all over Asia during the summer months, and
                                the increase in the winter, are hence, no doubt, the results of the alternate heating and cooling of the air over the
                                continent.</p>
                            <p>The necessary and immediate results of such periodical changes of pressure are winds, which, speaking generally, blow from the
                                area of greatest to that of least pressure—subject, however, to certain modifications of direction, arising from the absolute
                                motion of the whole body of the air due to the revolution of the earth on its axis from west to east. The south-westerly winds
                                which prevail north of the equator during the hot half of the year, to which navigators have given the name of the south-west
                                monsoon (the latter word being a corruption of the Indian name for season), arise from the great diminution of atmospheric
                                pressure over Asia, which begins to be strongly marked with the great rise of temperature in April and May, and the simultaneous
                                relatively higher pressure over the equator and the regions south of it. This diminution of pressure, which continues as the
                                heat increases till it reaches its maximum in July soon after the solstice, is followed by the corresponding development of the
                                south-west monsoon; and as the barometric pressure is gradually restored, and becomes equalized within the tropics soon after
                                the equinox in October, with the general fall of temperature north of the equator, the south-west winds fall off, and are
                                succeeded by a north-east monsoon, which is developed during the winter months by the relatively greater atmospheric pressure
                                which then occurs over Asia, as compared with the equatorial region.</p>
                            <p>Although the succession of the periodical winds follows the progress of the seasons as just described, the changes in the wind's
                                direction everywhere take place under the operation of special local influences which often disguise the more general law, and
                                make it difficult to trace. Thus the south-west monsoon begins in the Arabian Sea with west and north-westerly winds, which draw
                                round as the year advances to south-west and fall back again in the autumn by northwest to north. In the Bay of Bengal the
                                strength of the southwest monsoon is rather from the south and south-east, being succeeded by north-east winds after October,
                                which give place to northerly and north-westerly winds as the year advances. Among the islands of the Malay Archipelago the
                                force of the monsoons is much interrupted, and the position of this region on the equator otherwise modifies the directions of
                                the prevailing winds. The southerly summer winds of the Asiatic seas between the equator and the tropic do not extend to the
                                coasts of Java, and the southeasterly trade winds are there developed in the usual manner. The China Sea is fully exposed to
                                both monsoons, the normal directions of which nearly coincide with the centre of the channel between the continent of Asia and
                                the eastern islands.</p>
                            <p>The south-west monsoon does not generally extend, in its character of a south-west wind, over the land. The current of air
                                flowing in from over the sea is gradually diverted towards the area of least pressure, and at the same time is dissipated and
                                loses much of its original force. The winds which pass northward over India blow as south-easterly and easterly winds over the
                                north-eastern part of the Gangetic plain, and as south winds up the Indus. They seem almost entirely to have exhausted their
                                northward velocity by the time they have reached the northern extremity of the great Indian plain ; they are not felt on the
                                table-lands of Afghanistan, and hardly penetrate into the Indus basin or the ranges of the Himalaya, by which mountains, and
                                those which branch off from them into the Malay peninsula, they are prevented from continuing their progress in the direction
                                originally imparted to them.</p>
                            <p>Among the more remarkable phenomena of the hotter seas of Asia must be noticed the revolving storms or cyclones, which are of
                                frequent occurrence in the hot months in the Indian Ocean and China Sea, in which last they are known under the name of typhoon.
                                The cyclones of the Bay of Bengal appear to originate over the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and are commonly propagated in a
                                north-westward direction, striking the east coast of the Indian peninsula at various points, and then often advancing with an
                                easterly tendency over the land, and passing with extreme violence across the delta of the Ganges. They occur in all the hot
                                months, from June to October, and more rarely in November, and appear to be originated by adverse currents from the north
                                meeting those of the south-west monsoon. The cyclones of the China Sea also occur in the hot months of the year, but they
                                advance from north-east to south-west, though occasionally from east to west; they originate near the island of Formosa, and
                                extend to about the 10th degree of N. lat. They are thus developed in nearly the same latitudes and in the same months as those
                                of the Indian Sea, though their progress is in a different direction. In both cases, however, the storms appear to advance
                                towards the area of greatest heat. In these storms the wind invariably circulates from north by west through south to east.</p>

                            <p>The heated body of air carried from the Indian Ocean over southern Asia by the south-west monsoon comes up highly charged with
                                watery vapour, and hence in a condition to release a large body of water as rain upon the land, whenever it is brought into
                                circumstances which reduce its temperature in a notable degree. Such a reduction of temperature is brought about along the
                                greater part of the coasts of India and of the Burmo- Siamese peninsula by the interruption of the wind current by continuous
                                ranges of mountains, which force the mass of air to rise over them, whereby the air being rarefied, its specific capacity for
                                heat is increased and its temperature falls, with a corresponding condensation of the vapour originally held in suspension.</p>
                            <p>This explanation of the principal efficient cause of the summer rains of south Asia is immediately based on an analysis of the
                                complicated phenomena actually observed, and it serves to account for many apparent anomalies. The heaviest falls of rain occur
                                along lines of mountain of some extent directly facing the vapour-bearing winds, as on the Western Ghats of India and the west
                                coast of the Malay peninsula. The same results are found along the mountains at a distance from the sea, the heaviest rainfall
                                known to occur anywhere in the world (not less than 600 in. in the year) being recorded on the Khasi range about 100 m.
                                north-east of Calcutta, which presents an abrupt front to the progress of the moist winds flowing up from the Bay of Bengal. The
                                cessation of the rains on the southern border of Baluchistan, west of Karachi, obviously arises from the projection of the
                                south-east coast of Arabia, which limits the breadth of the south-west monsoon air current and the length of the coast-line
                                directly exposed to it. The very small and irregular rainfall in Sind and along the Indus is to be accounted for by the want of
                                any obstacle in the path of the vapour - bearing winds, which, therefore, carry the uncondensed rain up to the Punjab, where it
                                falls on the outer ranges of the western Himalaya and of Afghanistan.</p>
                            <p>The diurnal mountain winds are very strongly marked on the Himalaya, where they probably are the most active agents in
                                determining the precipitation of rain along the chain—the monsoon currents, as before stated, not penetrating among the
                                mountains. The formation of dense banks of cloud in the afternoon, when the up wind is strongest, along the southern face of the
                                snowy ranges of the Himalaya, is a regular daily phenomenon during the hotter months of the year, and heavy rain, accompanied by
                                electrical discharges, is the frequent result of such condensation.</p>
                            <p>Too little is known of the greater part of Asia to admit of any more being said with reference to this part of the subject, than
                                to <pb n="745" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0745.png"/> mention a few facts bearing on the rainfall. In northern Asia there is a generally equal rainfall of 19 to 29
                                in. between the Volga and the Lena in Manchuria and northern China, rather more considerable increase in Korea, Siam and Japan.
                                At Tiflis the yearly fall is 22 in.; on the Caspian about 7 or 8 in.; on the Sea of Aral 5 or 6 in. In south-western Siberia it
                                is 12 or 14 in., diminishing as we proceed eastward to 6 or 7 in. at Barnaul, and to 5 or 6 in. at Urga in northern Mongolia. In
                                eastern Siberia it is about 15 to 20 in. In China we find about 23 in. to be the fall at Peking ; while at Canton, which lies
                                nearly on the northern tropic and the region of the south-west monsoon is entered, the quantity is increased to 78 in. At
                                Batavia in Java the fall is about 78 in. ; at Singapore it is nearly 100 in. The quantity increases considerably on that part of
                                the coast of the Malay peninsula which is not sheltered from the south-west by Sumatra. On the Tenasserim and Burmese coast
                                falls of more than 200 in. are registered, and the quantity is here nowhere less than 75 or 80 in., which is about the average
                                of the eastern part of the delta of the Ganges, Calcutta standing at about 64 in. On the hills that flank Bengal on the east the
                                fall is very great. On the Khasi hills, at an elevation of about 4500 ft., the average of ten years is more than 550 in. As much
                                as 150 in. has been measured in one month, and 610 in. in one year. On the west coast of the Indian peninsula the fall at the
                                sea-level varies from about 75 to 100 in., and at certain elevations on the mountains more than 250 in. is commonly registered,
                                with intermediate quantities at intervening localities. On the east coast the fall is far less, nowhere rising to 50 in., and
                                towards the southern apex of the peninsula being reduced to 25 or 30 in. Ceylon shows from 60 to 80 in. As we recede from the
                                coast the fall diminishes, till it is reduced to about 25 or 30 in. at the head of the Gangetic plain. The tract along the Indus
                                to within 60 or 80 m. of the Himalaya is almost rainless, 6 or 8 in. being the fall in the southern portion of the Punjab. On
                                the outer ranges of the Himalaya the yearly fall amounts to about 200 in. on the east in Sikkim, and gradually diminishes on the
                                west, where north of the Punjab it is about 70 or 80 in. In the interior of the chain the rain is far less, and the quantity of
                                precipitation is so small in Tibet that it can be hardly measured. It is to the greatly reduced fall of snow on the northern
                                faces of the highest ranges of the Himalaya that is to be attributed the higher level of the snow-line, a phenomenon which was
                                long a cause of discussion.</p>
                            <p>In Afghanistan, Persia, Asia Minor and Syria, winter and spring appear to be the chief seasons of condensation. In other parts of
                                Asia the principal part of the rain falls between May and September, that is, in the hottest half of the year. In the islands
                                under the equator the heaviest fall is between October and February.</p>

                            <p>The general assemblage of animals and plants found over northern Asia resembles greatly that found in the parts of Europe which
                                are adjacent and have a similar climate. Siberia, north of the 50th parallel, has a climate not much differing from a similarly
                                situated portion of Europe, though the winters are more severe and the summers hotter. The rainfall, though moderate, is still
                                sufficient to maintain the supply of water in the great rivers that traverse the country to the Arctic Sea, and to support an
                                abundant vegetation. A similar affinity exists between the life of the southern parts of Europe and that in the zone of Asia
                                extending from the Mediterranean across to the Himalaya and northern China. This belt, which embraces Asia Minor, northern
                                Persia, Afghanistan, and the southern slopes of the Himalaya, from its elevation has a temperate climate, and throughout it the
                                rainfall is sufficient to maintain a vigorous vegetation, while the summers, though hot, and the winters, though severe, are not
                                extreme. The plants and animals along it are found to have a marked similarity of character to those of south Europe, with which
                                region the zone is virtually continuous.</p>
                            <p>The extremely dry and hot tracts which constitute an almost unbroken desert from Arabia, through south Persia and Baluchistan, to
                                Sind, are characterized by considerable uniformity in the types of life, which closely approach to those of the neighbouring hot
                                and dry regions of Africa. The region of the heavy periodical summer rains and high temperature, which comprises India, the
                                Indo- Chinese peninsula, and southern China, as well as the western part of the Malay Archipelago, is also marked by much
                                similarity in the plants and animals throughout its extent. The area between the southern border of Siberia and the margin of
                                the temperate alpine zone of the Himalaya and north China, comprising what are commonly called central Asia, Turkestan, Mongolia
                                and western Manchuria, is an almost rainless region, having winters of extreme severity and summers of intense heat. Its animals
                                and plants have a special character suited to the peculiar climatal conditions, more closely allied to those of the adjacent
                                northern Siberian tract than of the other bordering regions. The south-eastern parts of the Malay Archipelago have much in
                                common with the Australian continent, to which they adjoin, though their affinities are chiefly Indian. North China and Japan
                                also have many forms of life in common. Much still remains to be done in the exploration of China and eastern Asia; but it is
                                known that many of the special forms of this region extend to the Himalaya, while others clearly indicate a connexion with North
                                America.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing brief review of the principal territorial divisions according to which the forms of life are distributed in Asia,
                                indicates how close is the dependence of this distribution on climatic conditions, and this will be made more apparent by a
                                somewhat fuller account of the main features of the flora and fauna.</p>

                                <p>—The flora of the whole of northern Asia is in essentials the same as that of northern Europe, the differences being due
                                    rather to variations of species than of genera. The absence of the oak and of all heaths east of the Ural may be noticed.
                                    Pines, larch, birch are the principal trees on the mountains; willow, alders and poplars on the lower ground. The northern
                                    limit of the pine in Siberia is about 70º N.</p>
                                <p>Along the warm temperate zone, from the Mediterranean to the Himalaya, extends a flora essentially European in character.
                                    Many European species reach the central Himalaya, though few are known in its eastern parts. The genera common to the
                                    Himalaya and Europe are much more abundant, and extend throughout the chain, and to all elevations. There is also a
                                    corresponding diffusion of Japanese and Chinese forms along this zone, these being most numerous in the eastern Himalaya,
                                    and less frequent in the west.</p>
                                <p>The truly tropical flora of the hotter and wetter regions of eastern India is continuous with that of the Malayan peninsula
                                    and islands, and extends along the lower ranges of the Himalaya, gradually becoming less marked and rising to lower
                                    elevations as we go westward, where the rainfall diminishes and the winter cold increases.</p>
                                <p>The vegetation of the higher and therefore cooler and less rainy ranges of the Himalaya has greater uniformity of character
                                    along the whole chain, and a closer general approach to European forms is maintained; an increased number of species is
                                    actually identical, among these being found, at the greatest elevations, many alpine plants believed to be identical with
                                    species of the north Arctic regions. On reaching the Tibetan plateau, with the increased dryness the flora assumes many
                                    features of the Siberian type. Many true Siberian species are found, and more Siberian genera. Some of the Siberian forms,
                                    thus brought into proximity with the Indian flora, extend to the rainy parts of the mountains, and even to the plains of
                                    upper India. Assemblages of marine plants form another remarkable feature of Tibet, these being frequently met with growing
                                    at elevations of 14,000 to 15,000 ft. above the sea, more especially in the vicinity of the many salt lakes of those
                                    regions.</p>
                                <p>The vegetation of the hot and dry region of the south-west of the continent consists largely of plants which are diffused
                                    over Africa, Baluchistan and Sind ; many of these extend into the hotter parts of India, and not a few common Egyptian
                                    plants are to be met with in the Indian peninsula.</p>

                                    peninsula and islands, from about the 65th to the 105th meridian, was estimated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Dalton_Hooker">Sir J.D. Hooker</name> at 12,000 to 15,000. The principal orders,
                                    arranged according to their numerical importance, are as follows :—Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, Compositae,
                                    Gramineae, Euphorbiaceae, Acanthaceae, Cyperaceae and Labiatae. But within this region there is a very great variation
                                    between the vegetation of the more humid and the more arid regions, while the characteristics of the flora on the higher
                                    mountain ranges differ wholly from those of the plains. In short, we have a somewhat heterogeneous assemblage of tropical,
                                    temperate and alpine plants, as has been already briefly indicated, of which, however, the tropical are so far dominant as
                                    to give their character to the flora viewed as a whole. The Indian flora contains a more general and complete illustration
                                    of almost all the chief natural families of all parts of the world than any other country. Compositae are comparatively rare
                                    ; so also Gramineae and Cyperaceae are in some places deficient, and Labiatae, Leguminosae and ferns in others.
                                    Euphorbiaceae and Scrophulariaceae and Orchidaceae are universally present, the last in specially large proportions.</p>

                                    developed in the Malayan area, and extending from New Caledonia to Madagascar; it is found as far north as the Khasi hills,
                                    and in Ceylon, but does not appear on the Himalaya or in the peninsula of India. The Balsaminaceae may be named as being
                                    rare in the eastern region and very abundant in the peninsula. A distinct connexion between the flora of the peninsula and
                                    Ceylon and that of eastern tropical Africa is observable not only in the great similarity of many of the more truly tropical
                                    forms, and the identity of families and genera found in both regions, but in a more remarkable manner in the likeness of the
                                    mountain flora of this part of Africa to that of the peninsula, in which several species occur believed to be identical with
                                    Abyssinian forms. This connexion is further established by the absence from both areas of oaks, conifers and cycads, which,
                                    as regards the first two families, is a remarkable feature of the flora of the peninsula and Ceylon, as the mountains rise
                                    to elevations in which both of them are abundant to the north and east. With these facts it has to be noticed that many of
                                    the principal forms of the eastern flora are absent or comparatively rare in the peninsula and Ceylon.</p>
                                <p>The general physiognomy of the Indian flora is mainly determined by the conditions of humidity of climate. The impenetrable
                                    shady forests of the Malay peninsula and eastern Bengal, of the west coast of the Indian peninsula, and of Ceylon, offer a
                                    strong contrast to the more loosely timbered districts of the drier regions of central India and the north-western Himalaya.
                                    The forest areas of India include the dense vegetation and luxuriant growth of the Tarai jungles at the foot of the eastern
                                    Himalaya, and wide stretches of loosely timbered country which are a prevailing feature in the Central Provinces and parts
                                    of Madras. Where the lowlands are highly cultivated they are adorned with planted wood, and where they are cut off from rain

                                    snowy mountain slopes of Tibet to above 18,000 ft. On the west, with the drier climate, the forest is less luxuriant and
                                    dense, and the hill-sides and the valleys better cultivated. The warm mountain slopes are covered with <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    the tropical and temperate zones. North of the tropic the winter cold is sufficient to admit of the cultivation of almost
                                    all the cereals and vegetables of Europe, wheat being sown in November and reaped early in April. In this same region the
                                    summer heat and rain provide a thoroughly tropical climate, in which rice and other tropical cereals are freely raised,
                                    being as a rule sown early in July and reaped in September or October. In southern India, and the other parts of Asia and of
                                    the islands having a similar climate, the difference of the winter and summer half-years is not sufficient to admit of the
                                    proper cultivation of wheat or barley. The other cereals may be seen occasionally, where artificial irrigation is practised,
                                    in all stages of progress at all seasons of the year, though the operations of agriculture are, as a general rule, limited
                                    to the rainy months, when alone is the requisite supply of water commonly forthcoming.</p>
                                <p>The trees of India producing economically useful timber are comparatively few, owing to the want of durability of the wood,

                                    supplies the finest timber. It is found in greatest perfection in the forests of the west coasts of Burma and the Indian

                                <p>The flora of the rainless region of south-western Asia is continuous with the desert flora of northern and eastern Africa,
                                    and extends from the coast of Senegal to the meridian of 75º E., or from the great African desert to the border of the
                                    rainless tract along the Indus and the southern parts of the Punjab. It includes the peninsula of Arabia, the shores of the
                                    Persian Gulf, south Persia, and Afghanistan and Baluchistan. On the west its limit is in the Cape Verde Islands, and it is
                                    partially represented in Abyssinia.</p>
                                <p>The more common plants in the most characteristic part of this region in southern Arabia are Capparidaceae, Euphorbiaceae,
                                    and a few Leguminosae, a <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    </foreign>; palms, Polygonaceae, ferns, and other cryptogams, are rare. The number of
                                    families relative to the area is very small, and the number of genera and species equally restricted, in very many cases a
                                    single species being the only representative of an order. The aspect of the vegetation is very peculiar, and is commonly
                                    determined by the predominance of some four or five species, the rest being either local or sparingly scattered over the
                                    area. The absence of the ordinary bright green colours of vegetation is another peculiarity of this flora, almost all the
                                    plants having glaucous or whitened stems. Foliage is reduced to a minimum, the moisture of the plant being stored up in
                                    massive or fleshy stems against the long-continued drought. Aridity has favoured the production of spines as a defence from
                                    external attack, sharp thorns are frequent, and asperities of various sorts predominate. Many species produce gums and
                                    resins, their stems being encrusted with the exudations, and pungency and aromatic odour is an almost universal quality of

                                    while the proximity of the Australian continent has permitted the partial diffusion of Australian types which are not seen

                                <p>The analysis of the Hong Kong flora indicates that about three-fifths of the species are common to the Indian region, and
                                    nearly all the remainder are either Chinese or local forms. The number of species common to southern China, Japan and
                                    northern Asia is small. The cultivated plants of China are, with a few exceptions, the same as those of India. South China,
                                    therefore, seems, botanically, hardly distinct from the great Indian region, into which many Chinese forms penetrate, as
                                    before noticed. The flora of north China, which is akin to that of Japan, shows manifest relation to that of the
                                    neighbouring American continent, from which many temperate forms extend, reaching to the Himalaya, almost as far as Kashmir.
                                    Very little is known of the plants of the interior of northern China, but it seems probable that a complete botanical
                                    connexion is established between it and the temperate region of the Himalaya.</p>

                                    represented by a single species in Japan. Carnivora are also numerous, particularly the frequenters of cold climates, such
                                    as bears, weasels, wolves and foxes. Of the Insectivora numerous forms of moles, shrews and hedgehogs prevail. The Rodents
                                    are also well represented by various squirrels, mice and hares. Characteristic forms of this order in northern Asia are the

                                    </foreign>. The great order of Ungulata is represented by various forms of

                                    in the mountain chains of Asia ; and more sparingly by several peculiar forms of antelope, such as the saiga <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    </foreign>, or yellow sheep. Coming to the deer, we also meet with characteristic forms in
                                    northern Asia, especially those belonging to the typical genus <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    restricted to northern Asia, and is one of its most peculiar types.</p>
                                <p>The ornithology of northern Asia is even more closely allied to that of Europe than the mammal fauna. Nearly three-fourths of
                                    the well-known species of Europe extend through Siberia into the islands of the Japanese empire. Here again we have an
                                    absence of all tropical forms, and a great development of groups characteristic of cold and temperate regions. One of the
                                    most peculiar of these is the genus <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    stone-chats, finches, linnets and grosbeaks are well developed, and exhibit many species.</p>
                                <p>The mammal fauna of the Indian region of Asia is much more highly developed than that of the Palaearctic. The Quadrumana are
                                    represented by several peculiar genera, amongst which are <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    are found, such as <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    </foreign>. Tho Carnivora are likewise numerous ; and this region may be considered as the
                                    true home of the tiger, though this animal has wandered far north into the Palaearctic division of Asia. Other
                                    characteristic Carnivora are civets, various ichneumons, and the benturong <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                    </foreign>. Two species of bears are likewise restricted to the Indian region. In the order of
                                    Rodents squirrels are very numerous, and porcupines of two genera are met with. The Indian region is the home of the Indian
                                    elephant—one of the two sole remaining representatives of the order Proboscidea. Of the Ungulates, four species of
                                    rhinoceros and one of tapir are met with, besides several peculiar forms of the swine family. The Bovidae, or hollow-horned
                                    ruminants, are represented by several genera of antelopes, and by species of true <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                <p>The assemblage of birds of the Indian region is one of the richest and most varied in the world, being surpassed only by that

                                <p>The Ethiopian fauna plays but a subordinate part in Asia, intruding only into the south-western corner, and occupying the
                                    desert districts of Arabia and Syria, although some of the characteristic species reach still farther into Persia and Sind,
                                    and even into western India. The lion and the hunting-leopard, which may be considered as, in this epoch at least, Ethiopian
                                    types, extend thus far, besides various species of jerboa and other desert-loving forms.</p>
                                <p>In the birds, the Ethiopian type is shown by the prevalence of larks and stone-chats, and by the complete absence of the many
                                    peculiar genera of the Indian region.</p>
                                <p>The occurrence of mammals of the Marsupial order in the Molucca Islands and Celebes, while none have been found in the

                                    The same conclusion is indicated by the absence from the Moluccas and Celebes of various other Mammals, Quadrumana,

                                    </foreign>, or herrings, numerous forms occur in Asiatic
                                    waters, ascending the rivers many hundred miles ; one of the best-known of Indian fishes, the hilsa, is of this family. The
                                    sturgeons, which abound in the Black Sea and Caspian, and ascend the rivers that fall into them, are also found in Asiatic
                                    Russia, and an allied form extends to southern China. The walking or climbing fishes, which are peculiar to south-eastern
                                    Asia and Africa, are organized so as to be able to breathe when out of the water, and they are thus fitted to exist under

                                    connexion with Africa is marked by the occurrence of many genera common to Africa and India, and confined to those two
                                    regions, and similarities of form are not uncommon there in cases in which the genera are not peculiar. Of Coleopterous
                                    insects known to inhabit east Siberia, nearly one-third are found in western Europe. The European forms seem to extend to

                                    forms extend generally along the south coast of the Mediterranean up to the border of the great desert, and from the Levant

                                <p>Asia, including its outlying islands, has become the dwelling-place of all the great families into which the races of men
                                    have been divided. By far the largest area is occupied by the Mongolian group. These have yellow-brown skins, black eyes and
                                    hair, flat noses and oblique eyes. They are short in stature, with little hair on the body and face. In general terms they
                                    extend, with modifications of character probably due to admixture with other types and to varying conditions of life, over
                                    the whole of northern Asia as far south as the plains bordering the Caspian Sea, including Tibet and China, and also over
                                    the Indo- Malayan peninsula and Archipelago, excepting Papua and some of the more eastern islands.</p>
                                <p>Next in numerical importance to the Mongolians are the races which have been called by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Professor Huxley</name>
                                    <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                        <hi rend="italic">Melanochroic</hi>
                                    </foreign> and <foreign rend="italic">Xanthochroic</foreign>. The former includes the dark-haired
                                    people of southern Europe, and extends over North Africa, Asia Minor, Syria to south-western Asia, and through Arabia and
                                    Persia to India. The latter race includes the fair-haired people of northern Europe, and extends over nearly the same area
                                    as the Melanochroi, with which race it is greatly intermixed. The Xanthochroi have fair skins, blue eyes and light hair ;
                                    the others have dark skins, eyes and hair, and are of a slighter frame. Together they constitute what were once called the
                                    Caucasian races. The Melanochroi are not considered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Huxley</name> to be one of the primitive modifications of mankind,
                                    but rather to be the result of the admixture of the Xanthochroi with the Australoid type, next to be mentioned.</p>
                                <p>The third group is that of the Australoid type. Their hair is dark, generally soft, never woolly. The eyes and skin are dark,
                                    the beard often well developed, the nose broad and flat, the lips coarse, and jaws heavy. This race is believed to form the
                                    basis of the people of the Indian peninsula, and of some of the hill tribes of central India, to whom the name Dravidian has
                                    been given, and by its admixture with the Melanochroic group to have given rise to the ordinary population of the Indian
                                    provinces. It is also probable that the Australoid family extends into south Arabia and Egypt.</p>
                                <p>The last group, the Negroid, is represented by the races to which has been given the name of Negrito, from the small size of
                                    some of them. They are closely akin to the negroes of South Africa, and possess the characteristic dark skins, woolly but

                                    a part of the Malay peninsula, the Philippines, Papua, and some of the neighbouring islands. The Negritos appear to be
                                    derived from a mixture of the true Negro with the Australoid type.</p>

                                <p>The distribution of the Mongolian group in Asia offers no particular difficulty. There is complete present, and probably
                                    previous long-existing, geographical continuity in the area over „ which they are found. There is also considerable
                                    similarity of climate and other conditions throughout the northern half of Asia which they occupy. The extension of modified
                                    forms of the Mongolian type over the whole American continent may be mentioned as a remarkable circumstance connected with
                                    this branch of the human race.</p>
                                <p>The Mongolians of the northern half of Asia are almost entirely nomadic, hunters and shepherds or herdsmen. The least
                                    advanced of these, but far the most peaceful, are those that occupy Siberia. Farther south the best-known tribes are <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchu">the Manchus</name>, <name type="people">the Mongols

                                    old nomadic habits, and even their peculiar language. The predatory habits of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turkish</name>, <name type="people">Mongolian</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchu">Manchu</name> population of northern Asia, and their irruptions
                                    into other parts of the continent and into Europe, have produced very remarkable results in the history of the world.</p>
                                <p>The Chinese branch of the Mongolian family are a thoroughly settled people of agriculturists and traders. They are partially
                                    Buddhist, and have a peculiar monosyllabic, uninflected language, with writing consisting of symbols, which represent words,
                                    not letters.</p>
                                <p>The countries lying between India and the Mongolian are occupied by populations chiefly of the Mongolian and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">Chinese</name> type, having languages fundamentally
                                    monosyllabic, but using letters derived from India, and adopting their religion, which is almost everywhere Buddhist, from

                                    Chinese in all respects. It is known that to the Tibeto- Chinese modifications of the pure Mongolian type all the eastern
                                    Burmese tribes—<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chin_people">Chins</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jingpo">Kachins</name>, <name type="people">Shans</name>, etc.—belong (as indeed do

                                    of Kashmir.</p>
                                <p>Some light has been thrown on the connexion between the Tibetan race and certain tribes of central India, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bhil">the Bhils</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kol_people">Kols</name> ; and it seems more probable that these tribes are the remnants
                                    of a Mongolian race which first displaced a yet earlier Negroid population, and was then itself shouldered out by a
                                    Caucasian irruption, than that they entered India by any of the northern passages within historic times. Mongolian
                                    settlements have lately been found very much farther extended into the border countries of north-west India than has been

                                <p>The name of Aryan has been given to the races speaking languages derived from, or akin to, the ancient form of Sanskrit, who
                                    now occupy the temperate zone extending from the Mediterranean, across the highlands of Asia Minor, Persia and Afghanistan,
                                    to <pb n="749" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0749.png"/> India. The races speaking the languages akin to the ancient Assyrian, which are now mainly represented by
                                    Arabic, have been called Semitic, and occupy the countries south-west of Persia, including Syria and Arabia, besides
                                    extending into North Africa. Though the languages of these races are very different they cannot be regarded as physically
                                    distinct, and they are both without doubt branches of the Melanochroi, modified by admixture with the neighbouring races,
                                    the Mongols, the Australoids and the Xanthochroi.</p>
                                <p>The Aryans of India are probably the most settled and civilized of all Asiatic races. This type is found in its purest form
                                    in the north and north-west, while the mixed races and the population referred to the Australoid type predominate in the
                                    peninsula and southern India. The spoken languages of northern India are very various, differing one from another in the
                                    sort of degree that English differs from German, though all are thoroughly Sanskritic in their vocables, but with an absence
                                    of Sanskrit grammar that has given rise to considerable discussion. The languages of the south are Dravidian, not
                                    Sanskritic. The letters of both classes of languages, which also vary considerably, are all modifications of the ancient
                                    Pali, and probably derived from the Dravidians, not from the Aryans. They are written from left to right, exception being
                                    made of Urdu or Hindostani, the mixed language of the Mahommedan conquerors of northern India, the character used for
                                    writing which is the Persian. From the river Sutlej and the borders of the Sind desert, as far as Burma and to Ceylon, the
                                    religion of the great bulk of the people of India is Hindu or Brahminical, though the Mahommedans are often numerous, and in
                                    some places even in a majority. West of the Sutlej the population of Asia may be said to be wholly Mahommedan, with the
                                    exception of certain relatively small areas in Asia Minor and Syria, where Christians predominate. The language of the
                                    Punjab does not differ very materially from that of Upper India. West of the Indus the dialects approach more to Persian,
                                    which language meets Arabic and Turki west of the Tigris, and along the Turkoman desert and the Caspian. Through the whole
                                    of this tract the letters are used which are common to Persian, Arabic and Turkish, written from right to left.</p>

                                    be found in great numbers and in their purest form in the more inaccessible mountains and glens of the central highlands.

                                    underlying population of Persia, Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Badakshan, and their language (in the central districts of
                                    Asia) is found to contain words of Aryan or Sanskrit derivation which are not known in Persian. They have been for the most
                                    part dispossessed of their country by Turkish immigration and conquests, but they still retain their original intellectual
                                    superiority over <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turkish</name> and other mixed

                                    comparatively mongrel, or mixed, dialect. Ethnographers have traced a connexion between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkmen_people">the Turkoman</name> of central Asia and the Teutonic races of Europe,
                                    based on a similarity of national customs and immemorial usage. Evidence of an original affinity between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkmen_people">Turkoman</name> and Rajput has also been found in the mutual possession

                                    attested by practical knowledge of the districts they were said to occupy. The <hi rend="italic">habitat</hi> of <name type="people">the Nysaeans</name>, and the identity of certain tribes of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kafiristan">Kafiristan</name> with the descendants of these pre-Alexandrian colonists
                                    from the west, are also well established.

The ethnographical status of the mixed tribes of tho

                                    quite a new appreciation of the tribal origin of the great conglomeration of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baloch_people">Baluch peoples</name>.</p>
                                <p>The result of trans-border surveys to the north and west of India has been to establish the important geographical fact that
                                    it is by two gateways only, one on the north-west and one on the west of India, that the central Asiatic tides of
                                    immigration have flowed into the peninsula. The Kabul valley indicates the north-western entrance, and Makran indicates that
                                    on the west. By the Kabul valley route, which includes at its head the group of passes across the Hindu Kush which extend
                                    from the Khawak to the Kaoshan, all those central Asian hordes, be they <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saka">Sacae</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuezhi">Yue-chi</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jat_people">Jats</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goths">Goths</name> or <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, who were driven towards the rich plains of the south, entered the Punjab. Some of them migrated from
                                    districts which belong to eastern Asia, but none of them penetrated into India by eastern passes. Such tides as set towards
                                    the Himalaya broke against their farther buttresses, leaving an interesting ethnographical flotsam in the northern valleys ;
                                    but they never overflowed the Himalayan barrier. Later most of the historic invasions of India from central Asia followed
                                    tho route which leads directly from Kabul to Peshawar and Delhi.</p>
                                <p>By the western gates of Makran prehistoric irruptions from Mesopotamia broke into the plains of Lower Sind, and either passed
                                    on towards the central provinces of India or were absorbed in the highlands south of Kalat. In later centuries <name type="people">the Arabs</name> from the west reached the valley of the Indus by their western route, and there
                                    established a dynasty which lasted for 300 years. The identification of existing peoples with the various Scythic, Persian
                                    and Arab races who have passed from High Asia into the Indian borderland, has opened up a vast field of ethnographical
                                    inquiry which has hardly yet found adequate workers for its investigation. To such fields may be added the yet more
                                    complicated problems of those reflex waves which flowed backwards from India into the border highlands.</p>

                                <p>1. The borders assigned to Asia on the west are somewhat arbitrary. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">The Urals</name> indicate no real division of races, and in both Greek
                                    and Turkish times <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name> has been connected with
                                    the opposite shores of Europe rather than with the lands lying to the east. A juster view of early history is probably
                                    obtained by thinking of the countries round <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">the

                                <p>2. The words <q>"Asiatic"</q> and <q>"Oriental"</q> are often used as if they denoted a definite and homogeneous type, but
                                        <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians">Russians</name> resemble Asiatics in many ways, and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, <name type="people">Hindus</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">Chinese</name>, etc., differ in so many important points
                                    that the common substratum is small. It amounts to this, that Asiatics stand on a higher level than the natives of Africa or
                                    America, but do not possess the special material civilization of western Europe. As far as any common mental characteristic
                                    can be assigned it is also somewhat negative, namely, that Asiatics have not the same sentiment of independence and freedom
                                    as Europeans. Individuals are thought of as members of a family, state or religion, rather than as entities with a destiny
                                    and rights of their own. This leads to autocracy in politics, fatalism in religion and conservatism in both. Hence, too,
                                    Asiatic history has large and simple outlines. Though longer chronologically than the annals of Europe, it is less eventful,
                                    less diversified and offers fewer personalities of interest. But the same conditions which render individual eminence
                                    difficult procure for it when once attained a more ready recognition, and the conquerors and prophets of Asia have had more
                                    power and authority than their parallels in Europe. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genghis_Khan">Jenghiz Khan</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timur">Timur</name> covered more ground

                                <p>3. Attention has often been called to the religious character of Asia. Not only the great religions of the world—Buddhism,
                                    Christianity, Islam—but those of secondary importance, such as Judaism, Parseeism, Taoism, are all Asiatic. No European race
                                    left to itself has developed anything more than an unsystematic paganism. It is true that Greek philosophy advanced far
                                    beyond this stage, but it produced nothing sufficiently popular to be called a religion. <pb n="750" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0750.png"/> On the other hand
                                    Christianity, though Asiatic in its origin and essential ideas, has to a large extent taken its present form on European
                                    soil, and some of its most important manifestations— notably <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name>—are European reconstructions in which
                                    little of the Asiatic element remains. Christianity has made little way farther east than <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name>. Modern missions have made no great conquests there, and in
                                    earlier times the Nestorians and Jacobites who penetrated to central Asia, China and India, received respectful hearing, but
                                    never had anything like the success which attended Buddhism and Islam. Yet Buddhism has never made much impression west of
                                    India, and Islam is clearly repugnant to Europeans, for even when under Moslem rule (as in Turkey) they refuse to accept it
                                    in a far larger proportion than did <name type="people">the Hindus</name> in similar circumstances. Hence there is clearly a
                                    deep-seated difference between the religious feelings of the two continents.</p>
                                <p>Since Asiatic records go back much farther than those of Europe, it is natural that Asia should be thought the birthplace of
                                    civilization. But this originality cannot be absolute, for, whatever may have been the relations of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and the Aryans, the latter brought civilization to India
                                    from the west, and it is not always clear whether similarity of government and institutions is the result of borrowing or of
                                    parallel development. Both in Europe and in Asia small feudal or aristocratic states tended to consolidate themselves into
                                    monarchies, but whereas in Europe from the early days of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> onwards royalty has often been driven out and replaced temporarily or permanently by popular government,
                                    this change seems not to occur in Asia, where revolution means only a change of dynasty. The few cases where the government
                                    is not monarchical, as <name type="place">Arabia</name>, seem to represent the persistence of very ancient conditions.</p>
                                <p>The contemplation of Asia suggests that progress is most rapid when accompanied by the migration of races or the
                                    transplantation of ideas and institutions. Thus <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> excelled the Eastern countries from whom she may have derived her civilization, and Buddhism had a far
                                    more brilliant career outside India than in it.</p>

                                <p>4. In many parts of southern Asia are found semi-barbarous races representing the earliest known stratum of population, such
                                    as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vedda_people">the Veddahs</name> of Ceylon, and various tribes in
                                    China and the Malay Archipelago. Some of them offer analogies to the Australians. This connexion, if true, must be very
                                    ancient, since it apparently goes back to a time when the distribution of land and water was other than at present. In
                                    northern Asia are found other aborigines, such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ainu_people">the
                                        Ainus</name> of Japan and the so-called hyperborean races (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chukchi_people">Chukchis</name>, etc.), but no materials are at present forthcoming for
                                    their history. There is some record of the migrations of the later races superimposed on these aborigines. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">The Chinese</name> came from the west, though how far
                                    west is unknown : <name type="people">the Hindus</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people">Persians</name> from the north-west: <name type="people">the
                                        Burmese</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thai_people">the Siamese</name> from the north.
                                    We do not know if <name type="people">the Mongols</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, etc., had any earlier home than central Asia, but their
                                    extensive movements from that region are historical.</p>
                                <p>The antiquity of Asiatic history is often exaggerated. With the exception of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>, we can hardly even conjecture what was the condition of this
                                    continent much before 1500 B.C. At that period <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the
                                        Chinese</name> were advancing along the Hwang-ho, and the Aryans were entering India from the northwest. Both were in
                                    conflict with earlier races. The influence of Babylonian civilization was probably widespread. Some connexion between <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and China is generally admitted, and all
                                    Indian alphabets seem traceable to a Semitic original borrowed in the course of commerce from the Persian Gulf. Apart from
                                    European conquests, the internal history of Asia in the last 2000 years is the result of the interaction of four main
                                    influences: <list>
                                        <item>(a) Chinese,</item>
                                        <item>(b) Indian,</item>
                                        <item>(c) Mahommedan,</item>
                                        <item>(d) Central Asian</item>
                                    </list>. Of these the first three represent different types of civilization : the fourth has little originality, but has
                                    been of great importance in affecting the distribution of races and political power.</p>
                                <p>(a) China has moulded the civilization of the eastern mainland and Japan, without much affecting the Malay Archipelago. In
                                    the sphere of direct influence fall Korea, Japan and Annam ; in the outer sphere are Mongolia, Tibet, Siam, Cambodia and
                                    Burma, where Indian and Chinese influence are combined, the Indian being often the stronger. These countries, except Japan,
                                    have all been at some time at least nominal tributaries of China. Where Chinese influence had full play it introduced
                                    Confucianism, a special style in art and the Chinese system of writing. After the Christian era it was accompanied by
                                    Chinese Buddhism. The cumbrous Chinese script maintains itself in the Far East, but has not advanced west of China proper
                                    and Annam.</p>
                                <p>(b) Indian influence may be defined as Buddhism, if it is understood that Buddhism is not at all periods clearly
                                    distinguishable from Hinduism. Its sphere includes Indo-China, much of the Malay Archipelago, Tibet and Mongolia. Moreover,
                                    China and Japan themselves may be said to fall within this sphere, in view of the part which Buddhism has played in their
                                    development. The Buddhist influence is not merely religious, for it is always accompanied by Indian art and literature, and
                                    often by an Indian alphabet. Much of this art is Greek in origin, being derived from the Perso-Greek states on the
                                    north-west frontiers of India. Indian alphabets have spread to Tibet, Cambodia, Java and Korea. The history of Indian
                                    civilization in Indo-China and the Archipelago is still obscure, in spite of the existence of gigantic ruins, but it would
                                    appear that in some parts at least two periods must be distinguished, first the introduction of Hinduism (or mixed Hinduism
                                    and Buddhism), perhaps under Indian princes, and secondly a later and more purely ecclesiastical introduction of Sinhalese
                                    Buddhism, with its literature and art.</p>
                                <p>(c) Mahommedanism or Islam is perhaps the greatest transforming force which the world has seen. It has profoundly affected
                                    and to a large extent subjugated all western Asia including India, all eastern and northern Africa as well as Spain, and all
                                    eastern Europe. Its open advocacy of force attracts warlike races, and the intensity of its influence is increased by the
                                    fusion of secular and religious power, so that <name type="institution">the Moslem Church</name> is a Moslem state
                                    characterized by slavery, polygamy, and, subject to the autocracy of the ruler, by the theoretical equality of Moslems, who
                                    in political status are superior to non- Moslems. Thus, whenever the population of a Moslem country is of mixed belief, a
                                    ruling caste of Moslems is formed, as in Turkey at the present day and India under the Moguls. Islam is paramount in Turkey,
                                    Persia, Arabia and Afghanistan. India is the dividing line : Islam is strong in northern and central India, weaker in the
                                    south. But only one-fifth of the whole population is Moslem. Beyond India it has spread to Malacca and the Malay
                                    Archipelago, where it overwhelmed Hindu civilization, and reached the southern Philippines. But it made no progress in
                                    Indo-China or Japan ; and though there is a large Moslem population in China the Chinese influence has been stronger, for
                                    alone of all Asiatics <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> have succeeded
                                    in forcing Islam to accept the ordinary limitations of a religion and to take its place as a creed parallel to Buddbism or
                                    any other.</p>
                                <p>Even more than Buddhism Islam has carried with it a special style of art and civilization. It is usually accompanied by the
                                    use of the Arabic alphabet, and in the languages of Moslem nations (notably Turkish, Persian, Hindustani and Malay) a large
                                    proportion of the vocabulary is borrowed from Arabic. Hindi and Hindustani, two forms of the same language as spoken by
                                    Hindus and Mahommedans respectively, are a curious example of how deeply religion may affect culture.</p>
                                <p>(d) The great part which central Asian tribes have played in history is obscured by the absence of any common name for them.
                                    Linguistically they can be divided into several groups such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, <name type="people">Mongols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, but they were from time to time united into states
                                    representing more than one group, and their armies were recruited, like the Janissaries, from all the military races in the
                                    neighbourhood. Soon after the Christian era central Asia began to boil over, and at least seven great invasions and more or
                                    less complete conquests can be ascribed to these tribes without counting minor movements. <list>

                                <p>These tribes have a genius for warfare rather than for government, art or literature, and with few exceptions (e.g. <name type="people">the Moguls</name> in India) have proved poor administrators. Apart from conquest their most important
                                    function has been to keep up communications in central Asia, and to transport religions and civilizations from one region to
                                    another. Thus they are mainly responsible for the introduction of Islam with its Arabic or Persian civilization into India
                                    and Europe, and in earlier times their movements facilitated the infiltration of Graeco-Bactrian civilization into India
                                    besides maintaining communication between China and the West.</p>

                                <p>—The movements mentioned above have been the chief factors of relatively modern Asiatic history, but in early times the
                                    centre of activity and culture lay farther west in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>. These ancient states
                                    began to decline in the 7th century B.C., and on their ruins rose <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the Persian empire</name>, which with various political
                                    metamorphoses continued to be an important power till the 7th century A.D., after which all western Asia was overwhelmed by
                                    the Moslem wave, and old landmarks and kingdoms were obliterated.</p>
                                <p>The materials for the study of their institutions and population are abundant, but lend themselves to discussion rather than
                                    to a summary of admitted facts. In the early history of southwestern Asia <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> form the most important ethnic group, which is primarily
                                    linguistic but also shares other remarkable characteristics. Two of the greatest religions of the world, Christianity and
                                    Islam, are Semitic in origin, as well as Judaism. In politics these races have been less successful in modern times, but the
                                    Semitic states of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> were once the principal centres for the development and
                                    distribution of civilization. It is generally agreed that this civilization can be traced back to an earlier race, the
                                    Sumero-Akkadians, whose language seems allied to the agglutinative idioms of central Asia. If this ancient civilized race
                                    was really allied to the ancestors of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name>
                                    and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, it is a remarkable instance of how civilization
                                    thrives best by being transplanted at a certain period of growth. Still less is known of the early non-Aryan races of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name> such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hittites">the Hittites</name> and <name type="people">Alorodians</name>. One hypothesis
                                    supposes that the shores of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">the Mediterranean</name>
                                    were originally inhabited by a homogeneous race neither Aryan nor Semitic.</p>
                                <p>The earliest Sumerian records seem to be anterior to 4000 B.C. Shortly after that period <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> was invaded by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name>, who became the ruling race. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">The city of Babylon</name> came to the fore as metropolis about 2285 B.C.
                                    under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hammurabi">Khammurabi</name>. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> was an offshoot of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> lying to the north-west, and apparently colonized before
                                    the second millennium. While using the same language as the Babylonians, the Assyrians had an individuality which showed
                                    itself in art and religion. In the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. they became the chief power within their sphere and the
                                    suzerain of their parent <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name>. But they succumbed
                                    before the advance of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the Medo-Persian

                                <p>—This is the oldest of existing states, though its authentic history does not go back much beyond 1000 B.C. It is generally
                                    admitted that there was some connexion between the ancient civilizations of China and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, but its precise nature is still uncertain. It is clear,
                                    however, that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> came from the west,
                                    and entered their present territory along the course of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yellow_River">the Hwang-ho</name> at an unknown period, possibly about 3000 B.C. In early historical times China consisted of a
                                    shifting confederacy of feudal states, but about 220 B.C. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Qin_Dynasty">the state of Tsin or Chin</name> (whence the name China) came into
                                    prominence, and succeeded in forming a homogeneous empire, which advanced considerably towards the south. The subsequent
                                    history of China is mainly a record of struggles with various tribes, commonly, but not very correctly, called <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tatars">Tatars</name>. The empire was frequently broken up by successful
                                    incursions, or divided between rival dynasties, but at least twice became a great Asiatic power : under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Han_Dynasty">the Han dynasty</name> (about 200 B.C-A.D. 220), and
                                        <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tang_Dynasty">the T'ang</name> (A.D. 618-906). The dominions
                                    of the latter extended across central Asia to northern India, but were dismembered by the attacks of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khitan_people">the Kitans</name>, whence the name <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cathay">Cathay</name>. China proper, minus these external provinces, was again united
                                    under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song_Dynasty">the Sung dynasty</name> (960-1127), but split
                                    into the northern (Tatar) and southern (Chinese) kingdoms. In the 13th century arose <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongol_Empire">the Mongol power</name>, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kublai_Khan">Kublai Khan</name> conquered China. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongol_Empire">The Mongol dynasty</name> lasted less than a century, but <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ming_Dynasty">the Ming</name>, the native Chinese dynasty which
                                    succeeded it, reigned for nearly 300 years and despatched expeditions which reached India, Ceylon and East Africa. In 1644
                                        <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ming_Dynasty">the Ming</name> succumbed to the attacks of

                                <p>Until the advent of Europeans, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> were
                                    always in contact with inferior races. Whether they expanded at the expense of weak aboriginal tribes or were conquered by
                                    more robust invaders, Chinese civilization prevailed and assimilated alike the conquered and the conquerors. It is largely
                                    to this that we must ascribe the national conservatism and contempt for foreigners. The spirit of the Chinese polity is
                                    self-contained, anti-military and anti-sacerdotal. Rank is nominally determined by merit, as tested by competitive
                                    examinations. Society is conceived as regulated by mutual obligations, of which the duties of parents and children are the
                                    most important. The emperor is head of the state and the high priest, who sacrifices to Heaven on behalf of his people, but
                                    he can be deposed, and no divine right is inherent in certain families as in Japan and Turkey. On the contrary there have
                                    been 20 dynasties since the Christian era.</p>
                                <p>The most conspicuous figure in Chinese literature is <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confucius">Confucius</name> (551—475 B.C). Though he laid no claim to originality and merely sought to collect and systematize the
                                    traditions of antiquity, his influence in the Far East has been unbounded, and he must be pronounced one of the most
                                    powerful advocates of peace and humanity that have ever existed. Confucianism is an ethical rather than a religious system,
                                    and hence was able to co-exist, though not on very friendly terms, with Buddhism, which reached China about the 1st century
                                    A.D. and was the chief source of Chinese religious ideas, except the older ancestor worship. But they are not a religious
                                    people, and like many Europeans regard the church as a department of the state.</p>

                                    Buddhism were introduced. The government was originally autocratic, but as early as the 7th century the most characteristic

                                    of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fujiwara_clan">the Fujiwara family</name>, and then of the
                                    rivalry between the houses of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taira_clan">Taira</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minamoto_clan">Minamoto</name>. The latter prevailed, and in 1192
                                    established the dual system of government under which the emperor or Mikado ruled only in name, and the real power was in
                                    the hands of a hereditary military chief called Shogun. Japan has never been invaded in historical times, but an attempt
                                    made by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kublai_Khan">Kublai Khan</name> to conquer it was successfully
                                    repulsed. The chief power then passed to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashikaga_clan">the
                                        Ashikaga dynasty</name> of Shoguns, who retained it for about 200 years and were distinguished for their patronage of
                                    the arts. The second half of the 16th century was a period of ferment and anarchy, marked by the arrival of the Portuguese
                                    <pb n="752" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0752.png"/> and the rise of some remarkable adventurers, one of whom, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi">Hideyoshi</name>, conquered Korea and apparently meditated the
                                    invasion of China. His plans were interrupted by his death, and his successor, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu</name>, who shaped the social and political life of Japan for
                                    nearly 300 years (1603-1868), definitely decided on a policy of seclusion and isolation. All ideas of external conquest were
                                    abandoned, Christianity was forbidden, and Japan closed to foreigners, only the Dutch being allowed a strictly limited
                                    commerce. In 1854-1859 the Christian powers, beginning with the United States, successfully asserted their right to trade
                                    with Japan. The influx of new ideas provoked civil war, in which the already decadent Shogunate was abolished and the
                                    authority of the Mikado restored. Recognizing that their only chance of competing with Europeans was to fight them with
                                    their own weapons, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> set themselves
                                    deliberately to assimilate the material civilization and to some extent the institutions of Europe, such as constitutional
                                    government. Their progress and success are without parallel. In 1895 they defeated <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> and ten years later <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians">the Russians</name>. Their exceptional status among Asiatic nations has been
                                    recognized by treaties which, contrary to the general practice in non- Christian countries, place all foreigners in Japan
                                    under Japanese law.</p>
                                <p>This sudden development of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> is
                                    perhaps the most important event of the second half of the 19th century, since it marks the rise of an Asiatic power capable
                                    of competing with Europe on equal terms. Their history is so different from that of the rest of Asia that it is not
                                    surprising if the result is different. The nation hardly came into existence till China and India had passed their prime,
                                    and remained secluded and free from the continual struggle against barbarian invaders, which drained the energies of its
                                    neighbours. It was left untouched by Mahommedanism, and for an unprecedentedly long period kept Europeans at bay without
                                    wasting its strength in hostilities. The military spirit was evolved, not in raids and massacres of the usual Asiatic type
                                    which create little but intense racial hatred, but in feuds between families and factions of the same race, which restrained
                                    ferocity and tended to create a temper like that of the feudal chivalry of Europe. On the other hand it is noticeable that
                                        <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> have little which is original
                                    in the way of religion, literature or philosophy. Unlike <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> and <name type="people">Indians</name>, they have
                                    hitherto not had the smallest influence on the intellectual development of Asia, and though they have in the past sometimes
                                    shown themselves intensely nationalist and conservative, they have, compared with India and China, so little which is really
                                    their own that their assimilation of foreign ideas is explicable.</p>

                                    suzerainty. In 1895 Korea was declared independent.</p>

                                <p>—The population of India comprises at least three strata: firstly, uncivilized aborigines, such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kol_people">the Kols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santals">Santhals</name>, and secondly, the Dravidians (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tamil_people">Tamils</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kannadiga">Kanarese</name>, etc.), who perhaps represent the earliest northern
                                    invaders, and appear to have attained some degree of culture on their own account. The most recent authorities are of
                                    opinion that the Kolarians and Dravidians represent a single physical type; but, whatever the historical explanation may be,
                                    they certainly have different languages and show different stages of civilization. In prehistoric times they were spread
                                    over the whole of India, but were driven to the centre and south of the peninsula by the third stratum of Aryans, and
                                    perhaps also by invasions of so-called Mongolian races from the north-west. No historical record has been preserved of these
                                    latter, but they appear to have profoundly affected the population of Bengal, which is believed to be Mongolo- Dravidian in
                                    composition. The Aryans appear to have been settled to the north of the Hindu Kush, and to have migrated south-eastwards
                                    about 1500 B.C. Their original home has been a subject of much discussion, but the view now prevalent is that they arose in
                                    southern Russia or Asia Minor, whence a section spread eastwards and divided into two closely related branches— the Hindus
                                    and Iranians. There were probably two successive Aryan immigrations, and the tradition of a struggle between them may be
                                    preserved in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mahābhārata">

                                    </title>, was quasi-nomadic and in many ways democratic, but by the 6th century B.C.
                                    settled states had been formed in the Ganges valley. They were absolute monarchies, but the power of the king was tempered
                                    by the extraordinary influence possessed by the hereditary sacerdotal class or Brahmans. The position of this class, which
                                    has remained till the present day, is connected with the institution of caste, a division of the population into groups
                                    founded partly on racial distinctions. The peaceful progress of Brahmanism was hindered by the doctrine of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gautama_Buddha">the Indian prince Gotama, called the Buddha,</name> which
                                    grew into one of the greatest religions of the world. For many centuries the culture and development of <name type="people">the Hindus</name> depended mainly on the interaction of the old Brahmanical religion and Buddhism. The latter was
                                    finally absorbed, and disappeared in India itself, but has spread Indian influence over the whole of eastern Asia, where it
                                    still flourishes.</p>
                                <p>In 326 B.C. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name> invaded <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Punjab_region">the Punjab</name>. The immediate result was small, but the
                                    establishment of Perso-Greek kingdoms in central Asia had a powerful influence on Indian art and culture. It may also have
                                    helped to familiarize the Hindu mind with the idea of an empire, which appeared among them later than in other Asiatic
                                    countries. The first empire, called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurya_Empire">Maurya</name>,
                                    reached its greatest extent in the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashoka_the_Great">Asoka</name> (264-227 B.C.), who ruled from Afghanistan to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chennai">Madras</name>. He was a zealous Buddhist and gave the first example of a missionary religion, for by his exertions the
                                    faith was spread over all India and Ceylon. No Hindu empires have lasted long, and the Maurya dominions broke up fifty years
                                    after his death.</p>
                                <p>In the next period (c. 150 B.C.-A.D. 300) India was invaded from the north by tribes partly of Parthian and partly of Turki
                                        (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yuezhi">Yue-chi</name>, etc.) origin. Owing to the absence of
                                    dated records, the chronology of these invasions has not yet been set beyond dispute, but the most important was that of
                                        <name type="people">the Kushans</name>, whose king <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kanishka">Kanishka</name> founded a state which comprised northern India and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kashmir">Kashmir</name>. They were Buddhists, and it is probable that the Mahāyāna or
                                    northern form of Buddhism was due to an amalgamation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gautama_Buddha">Gotama</name>'s doctrines with the ideas (largely Greek and Persian) which they brought with them. Much of Sivaism has
                                    probably the same origin. Another native empire, known as <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gupta_Empire">Gupta</name>, rose on the ruins of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kushan_Empire">the Kushan kingdom</name>, and embraced nearly the whole peninsula, but
                                    it broke up in the 5th century, partly owing to the attacks of new northern invaders, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">the Huns</name>. <name type="institution">The Malava dynasty</name> maintained
                                    Hindu civilization in the 6th century, and from 606 to 646 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harsha">Harsha</name> established a brief but brilliant empire in the north with its capital at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kannauj">Kanauj</name>. This epoch is marked by the renaissance of Sanskrit literature
                                    and the gradual revival of Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. But after <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harsha">Harsha</name> Hindu history is lost in a maze of small and transitory states,
                                    incapable of resisting the ever advancing Mahommedan peril. As early as 712 <name type="people">the Arabs</name> conquered
                                    Sind, and by the end of the 11th century the whole of northern India was in Moslem hands. Two periods may be distinguished,
                                    namely the Turki (1200-1526) and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul
                                        empire</name>. The former comprised several dynasties of mixed Turki and Iranian race, but was wanting in coherency. In
                                    the neighbourhood of the Moslem capitals, Islam spread rapidly, but in such districts as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rajputana">Rajputana</name> and specially <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vijayanagara">Vijayanagar</name>
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mysore">(Mysore)</name> Hindu civilization and religion maintained themselves.</p>
                                <p>In 1526 <name type="people">the Moguls</name> descended on India from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transoxiana">Transoxiana</name> and seized the throne of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delhi">Delhi</name>. They never subjugated the south, but the empire which they founded
                                    in the north was for about two centuries, under such rulers as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akbar_the_Great">Akbar</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shah_Jahan">Shah Jehan</name>, one of the most brilliant which Asia has seen. After
                                    1707 it began to decline: the governors became independent: a powerful <pb n="753" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0753.png"/>

A still more formidable
                                    danger, the power of the French and English, continued to increase. Amidst such confusion the authority of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name> rapidly disappeared, but it
                                    lasted as a name till the Mutiny (1857).</p>
                                <p>Indian history until Mahommedan times is marked by the unusual prominence of religious ideas, and is a record of intellectual
                                    development rather than of political events. Whatever national unity the Hindu peoples possessed came from the persistent
                                    and penetrating influence of the Brahman caste. Kings held a secondary position, and were generally regarded as adventitious
                                    tyrants, rather than as the heads and representatives of the nation. Even the great dynasties have left few traces, and it
                                    is with difficulty that the patient historian disinters the minor kingdoms from obscurity, but Indian religion, literature
                                    and art have influenced all Asia from Persia to Japan.</p>

                                    Median, began to expand at the expense of the surrounding states. They destroyed <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nineveh">Nineveh</name> in alliance with the Babylonians, and half a century later
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great">Cyrus</name> took <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name> and founded <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the great dynasty of the Achaemenidae</name>. The substitution of
                                    the Persian for the Median power, which took place with the advent of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great">Cyrus</name>, seems to indicate merely the pre-eminence of a
                                    particular tribe and not conquest by another race. The power of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the Achaemenidae</name>, when at its maximum, extended from the Oxus
                                    and Indus in the east to Thrace in the west and Egypt in the south, but fell before Greece, after lasting for rather more
                                    than 200 years. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I_of_Persia">Darius</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I_of_Persia">Xerxes</name> were repulsed in their efforts to

                                        III.</name> in 329. But the greater part of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the empire</name> continued to exist under new masters, the Seleucids, as a Hellenistic power which was of great
                                    importance for the dissemination of Greek culture in the East. Bactria soon became independent under an Indo- Greek dynasty,
                                    and the blending of Greek, Persian, central Asiatic and Hindu influences had an important effect on the art and religion of
                                    India, and through India on all eastern Asia. About the same period (250 B.C.-A.D. 227) <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsacid_Empire">the Parthian empire</name> arose under the Arsacids in Khorasan and the
                                    adjacent districts. <name type="people">The Parthians</name> appear to have been a Turanian tribe who had adopted many
                                    Persian customs. They successfully withstood the Romans, and at one time their power extended from India to Syria. They
                                    succumbed to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sassanid_Empire">the Persian dynasty of the
                                        Sassanids</name>, who ruled successfully for about four centuries, established the Zoroastrian faith as their state
                                    religion, and maintained a creditable conflict with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">the East Roman empire</name>. But in the 7th century they were
                                    defeated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">Heraclius</name>, and shortly afterwards were
                                    annihilated before the first impetus of the Mahommedan conquest, which established Islam in Persia and the neighbouring
                                    lands, sweeping away old civilizations and boundaries. During the greater part of the Mahommedan period Persia has been
                                    ruled by troubled and short-lived dynasties. It attained a certain dignity and unity under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbas_I_of_Persia">Abbas Shah</name> (1585-1628), but in later times was distracted and
                                    disorganized by Afghan invasions. The present dynasty, which is of Turkoman origin, dates from 1789.</p>
                                <p>The achievements of the Persians in art, literature and religion are by no means contemptible, but somewhat mixed and
                                    cosmopolitan. Owing to its position, the Persian state, when it from time to time became a conquering empire, overlapped
                                    Asia Minor, Babylon and India, and hence acted as an intermediary for transmitting art and ideas, sending for instance Greek
                                    sculpture to India and the cult of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mithra">Mithra</name> to western
                                    Europe. It is perhaps on account of this intermediate flavour that the literature of Persia—for instance the adaptations of
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omar_Khayyám">Omar Khayyam</name>— is more appreciated in Europe
                                    than that of other Oriental nations. On the other hand, the wars between Persia and Greece were recognized both at the time
                                    and afterwards as a struggle between Europe and Asia; the fact that both combatants were Aryans was not felt, and has no
                                    importance compared to the difference of continent.</p>

                                <p>—<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Israelites">The Israelites</name> appear to have been originally a
                                    nomadic tribe akin to <name type="people">the Arabs</name>, whom they resemble in their want of political instinct and in
                                    their extraordinary religious genius. Among many remarkable qualities they have been distinguished from the earliest times
                                    by a species of commensalism, or power of living among other nations without becoming either socially merged or politically
                                    distinct. Their traditional history represents them as migrating to the borders of Egypt and living there for some
                                    centuries. After the exodus, which perhaps took place about 1300 B.C., they moved northwards again and founded a state of
                                    modest dimensions, which attained a short-lived unity under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon">Solomon</name>, but succumbed to internal dissensions and to the attacks of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shalmaneser_V">Shalmanezer</name> destroyed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria)">the northern kingdom or Israel</name> in 720, and
                                    following the practice of the times deported the majority of the population, whose traces became lost to history. There is
                                    no reason why their descendants should not be found to-day in various tribes, but the physical type commonly called Jewish
                                    is characteristic not so much of Israel as of western Asia generally. In 588 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nebuchadnezzar_II">Nebuchadrezzar</name> carried off the Jews in captivity, but after
                                    the Persian conquest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> they were allowed to
                                    return to Palestine in 538. Their institutions and ideas were probably considerably modified during this period. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name> long continued to be a Jewish centre whence <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">the Jews</name> radiated to other countries. The restored state of
                                        <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</name> lived for about six centuries in partial
                                    independence under Persian, Egyptian, Syrian and Roman rule, often showing an aggressively heroic attachment to its national
                                    customs, which brought it into collision with its suzerains, until the temple was destroyed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Titus">Titus</name> in A.D. 70, and the country laid waste in the succeeding years. But
                                    long before this period the Jews of the Dispersion had become as important as the inhabitants of Palestine. From choice or
                                    compulsion large numbers settled in Egypt in the time of the Ptolemies, and added an appreciable element to Alexandrine
                                    culture, while gradual voluntary emigration established Jewish communities in Syria, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, who
                                    facilitated the first spread of Christianity. In spite of chronic unpopularity and recurring persecutions they have spread
                                    over nearly all Europe. At the end of the 15th century they were expelled from Spain and many of the exiles moved eastwards.
                                    At present the largest numbers are to be found in the eastern parts of Europe. It is remarkable that though <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">the Jews</name> live in relative peace with Asiatics, the great
                                    majority of them prefer Europe as a residence.</p>

                                    surrounding nations from the 9th century B.C. onwards. They appear to have had few states or kings, but rather tribes and
                                    chiefs. Their relationship to the Babylonians and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">Jews</name> is
                                    indicated by linguistic and ethnological data. The language and writing of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> who, at an unknown period, settled in what is now
                                    Abyssinia, show affinities with those of South Arabia, and these <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> may have been immigrants into Africa from that region. It
                                    is plain from early Moslem literature that Persian, Christian and especially Jewish ideas had penetrated into Arabia.</p>
                                <p>With the rise of Mahommedanism occurred a sudden effervescence of <name type="people">the Arabs</name>, who during some
                                    centuries threatened to impose not only their political authority but their civilization and new religion on the whole known
                                    world. They successfully invaded India and central Asia in the east, Spain and Morocco in the west. The Caliphate under
                                        <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umayyad_Caliphate">the Omayyads of Damascus</name>, and then

                                    principal power in the nearer East. It had not, however, a sufficiently coherent organization for permanence; parts of it
                                    became independent, <pb n="754" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0754.png"/> others were first protected and then absorbed by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name>. The Arab rule in Spain, which once threatened to
                                    overwhelm Europe and was turned back near <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tours">Tours</name> by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Martel">Charles Martel</name>, was distinguished by its tolerance
                                    and civilization, and lingered on till the 15th century.</p>
                                <p>The collapse of the political power of <name type="people">the Arabs</name> was singularly complete. The Caliphate, though
                                    Arabian, was always geographically outside Arabia, and on its fall Arabia remained as it was before Islam, isolated and
                                    inaccessible. It is still one of the least known parts of the globe, and has hardly any political link with the outside, for
                                        <name type="people">the Arabs</name> of northern Africa form separate states. But in spite of this total political
                                    collapse, Arabic religion and literature are still one of the greatest forces working in the western half of Asia, in
                                    northern Africa and to some extent in eastern Europe.</p>

                                <p>—This widely - scattered race has no political union and its distribution is a puzzle for ethnography. At present it occupies
                                    the extremity of the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines and other islands of the Malay Archipelago as
                                    well as Madagascar, while the inhabitants of most islands in the South Seas, including New Zealand and Hawaii, speak
                                    languages which if not Malay have at least undergone a strong Malay influence. It would seem from this distribution that
                                        <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">the Malays</name> are not continental, but a
                                    seafaring race with exceptional powers of dispersal, who have spread over the ocean from some island centre—perhaps Java.
                                    The latest theory, however, is that there is a great linguistic group (which may or may not prove to correspond to an ethnic
                                    unity) comprising the Mundā, Mōnkhmer, Malay, Polynesian and Micronesian languages, and that the stream of immigration which
                                    distributed them started from the extreme west. Three periods can be traced in the history of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">the Asiatic Malays</name>. In the first (in which such tribes as

                                    semi-barbarous. In the second, Hindu civilization reached the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and other islands. The presence
                                    of Hindu ruins, as well as of numerous Indian words and customs, testifies to the strength of this influence. It was,
                                    however, superseded by Islam, which spread to the Malay Archipelago and Peninsula before the 16th century. At the present

                                <p>—This remote and mountainous country has a peculiar civilization. It has entirely escaped Islam, and though it is a nominal
                                    vassal of China, direct Chinese influence has not been strong. The most striking feature is the religion, a corrupt form of
                                    late Indian Buddhism, known as Lamaism, which, largely in consequence of the favour shown by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genghis_Khan">Jenghiz Khan</name> and his successors, has attained temporal power and
                                    developed into an ecclesiastical state curiously like the papacy.</p>

                                <p>18. Almost all Asiatic countries have a literature, but it is often not indigenous and consists of foreign works, chiefly
                                    religious, read either in translations or the original. Thus with the exception of a little folklore the literature of
                                    Indo-China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea and Manchuria is mainly Indian or Chinese. The chief original literatures are Chinese,
                                    Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic and Persian. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">The
                                        Japanese</name> have produced few books of importance, and their compositions are chiefly remarkable as being lighter
                                    and more secular than is usual in Asia, but the older Chinese works take high rank both for their merits and the effect they
                                    have had. The extensive Sanskrit literature, which has reached in translations China, Japan and Java, is chiefly theological
                                    and poetical, history being conspicuously absent. India has also a considerable medieval and modern literature in various
                                    languages. Pali, though only a form of Hindu literature, has a separate history, for it died in India and was preserved in
                                    Ceylon, whence it was imported to Burma and Siam as the language of religion. The Pali versions of Buddha's discourses are
                                    among the most remarkable products of Asia. The literatures of all Moslem peoples are largely inspired by Arabic, which has
                                    produced a voluminous collection of works in prose and poetry. Persian, after being itself transformed by Arabic, has in its
                                    turn largely influenced all west Asiatic Moslem literature from Hindustani to Turkish.</p>
                                <p>If one excepts <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Testament">the Old Testament</title>, which is a product of the
                                    extreme west of Asia, it is remarkable how small has been the influence of Asiatic literature on Europe. Though Greek and
                                    Slavonic almost ceased to be written languages under Turkishrule, Europeans showed no disposition to replace them by Ottoman
                                    or Arabic literature.</p>
                                <p>Without counting subdivisions, there would seem to be three main schools of art in Asia at present—Chinese, Indian and
                                    Moslem. The first contains many original elements. It is feeblest in architecture and strongest in the branches demanding
                                    skill and care in a limited compass, such as painting, porcelain and enamel. It is the main inspiration of Japanese art,
                                    which, however, shows great originality in its treatment of borrowed themes. Both China and Japan have felt through Buddhism
                                    the influence of Indian art, which contains at least two elements— one indigenous and the other Greco-Persian. Unlike
                                    Chinese art it has a genius for architecture and sculpture rather than painting. Mahommedan art is also largely
                                    architectural and has affected <pb n="755" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0755.png"/> nearly all Moslem countries. Except that the use of Arabic inscriptions is one
                                    of its principal methods of decoration, it owes little to Arabia and much to Byzantium. The Persian variety of this art is
                                    more ornate, and less averse to representations of living beings. Both Moslem and Chinese art are closely connected with
                                    calligraphy, but Hindus rarely use writing for ornament.</p>
                                <p>In both art and literature modern Asia is inferior to the past more conspicuously than Europe.</p>
                                <p>As for science, astronomy was cultivated by the Babylonians at an early period, and it is probably from them that a knowledge
                                    of the heavenly bodies and their movements spread over Asia. Grammar and prosody were studied in India with a marvellous
                                    accuracy and minuteness several centuries before <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus">Christ</name>.
                                    Mathematics were cultivated by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name>,
                                        <name type="people">Indians</name> and <name type="people">Arabs</name>, but nearly all the sciences based on the
                                    observation of nature, including medicine, have remained in a very backward condition. Much the same, however, might have
                                    been said of Europe until two centuries ago, and the scientific knowledge of <name type="people">the Arabs</name> under the
                                    earlier <name type="institution">Caliphates</name> was equal or superior to that of any of their contemporaries. Histories
                                    and accounts of travels have been composed both in Arabic and Chinese.</p>

                                <p>19. It is only natural that Europe should have chiefly felt the influence of western Asia. Though Europeans may be indebted
                                    to China for some mechanical inventions, she was too distant to produce much direct effect, and the influence of India has
                                    been mainly directed towards the East. The resemblances between primitive Christianity and Buddhism appear to be
                                    coincidences, and though both early Greek philosophy and later Alexandrine ideas suggest Indian affinities, there is no
                                    clear connexion such as there is between certain aspects of Chinese thought and India.</p>

                                    Africa adjoining Europe, so that the final invaders were in touch with Asiatic settlements. Though <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> have profoundly affected the whole of eastern Europe,
                                    the result of their conquests has been not so much to plant Asiatic culture in Europe as to arrest development entirely, the

                                    south Arabia is now discredited, but there was certainly a continuous stream of <name type="people">Arab</name> migration to
                                    East Africa which probably began in pre-Moslem times and founded a series of cities on the coast. The whole of the north of
                                    Africa from Egypt to Morocco has been mahommedanized, and Mahommedan influence is general and fairly strong from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timbuktu">Timbuktu</name> to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lake_Chad">Lake Chad</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ouaddaï_Region">Wadai</name>.

                                    but their power, though formidable, has disappeared without leaving any permanent traces.</p>
                                <p>The relation to Asia of the pre-European civilizations of America is another of those questions which admit of no definite
                                    answer at present, though many facts support the theory that the semi-civilized inhabitants of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mexico">Mexico</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_America">Central America</name> crossed from Asia by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bering_Strait">Bering Straits</name> and descended the west coast.

                                    hold that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peru">Peruvian civilization</name> had no connexion with the

                                <p>20. European influence on Asia has been specially strong at two epochs, firstly after the conquests of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</name>, and secondly from the 16th century
                                    onwards. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name>'s conquests resulted in
                                    the foundation of Perso-Greek kingdoms in Asia, which not only hellenized their own area but influenced the art and religion
                                    of India and to some extent of China. Then follows a long period in which eastern Europe was mainly occupied in combating
                                    Asiatic invasions, and had little opportunity of Europeanizing the East. Somewhat later the Crusades kept up communication
                                    with the Levant, and established there the power of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name>, somewhat to the detriment of oriental
                                    Christianity, but intercourse with farther Asia was limited to the voyages of a few travellers. Looking at eastern Europe
                                    and western Asia only, one must say that Asiatic influences have on the whole prevailed hitherto (though perhaps the tide is
                                    turning), for Islam is paramount in this region and European culture at a low ebb. But the case is quite different if one
                                    looks at the two continents as a whole, for improvement in means of communication has brought about strange vicissitudes,
                                    and western Europe has asserted her power in middle and eastern Asia.</p>
                                <p>In the 16th century a new era began with the discovery by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_people">the Portuguese</name> of the route to India round <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_of_Good_Hope">the Cape</name>, and the naval powers of Europe started one after
                                    another on careers of oriental conquest. The movement was maritime and affected the nations in the extreme west of Europe
                                    rather than those nearer Asia, who were under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the
                                        Turkish yoke</name>. Also the parts of Asia affected were chiefly India and the extreme East. The countries west of
                                    India, being less exposed to naval invasion, remained comparatively untouched. It will thus be seen that European (excluding
                                    Russian) power in Asia is based almost entirely on improved navigation. There was no attempt to overwhelm whole empires by
                                    pouring into them masses of troops, but commerce was combined with territorial acquisition, and a continuity of European
                                    interest secured by the presence of merchants and settlers. The course of oriental conquest followed the events of European
                                    politics, and the possessions of European powers in the East generally changed hands according to the fortunes of their
                                    masters at home. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name> was first on the scene, and
                                    in the 16th century established a considerable littoral empire on the coasts of East Africa, India and China, fragments of
                                    which still remain, especially <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goa">Goa</name>, where Portuguese
                                    influence on the natives was considerable. Before the century was out <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name> appeared as the successful rivals of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_people">the Portuguese</name>, but the real struggle for supremacy in
                                    southern Asia took place between France and England about 1740-1783. Both entered India as commercial companies, but the
                                    disorganized condition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name>
                                    necessitated the use <pb n="756" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.02.0756.png"/> of military force to protect their interests, and allured them to conquest. The companies
                                    gradually undertook the financial control of the districts where they traded and were recognized by the natives as political
                                    powers. The ultimate victory of England seems due less to any particular aptitude for dealing with oriental problems than to
                                    a better command of the seas and to considerations of European politics. At the end of the Napoleonic wars Portugal had
                                    Macao and Goa, Holland Java, Sumatra and other islands, France some odds and ends in India, while England emerged with Hong
                                    Kong, Singapore, Ceylon and a free hand in India. Guided by such administrators as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warren_Hastings">Warren Hastings</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_India_Company">the East India Company</name> had assumed more and more definitely
                                    the functions of government for a great part of India. In 1809 its exclusive trading rights were taken away by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">Parliament</name>, but its
                                    administrative status was thus made clearer, and when after the mutiny of 1857 it was desirable to define British authority
                                    in India there seemed nothing unnatural in declaring it to be a possession of the crown.</p>
                                <p>Another category of European possessions in Asia comprises those acquired towards the end of the 19th century, such as
                                    Indo-China (France), Burma and Wei-Hai-Wei (Britain), and Kiao-Chow (Germany). Whereas the earlier conquests were mostly the
                                    results of large half-conscious national movements working out their destinies in the East, these later ones were
                                    annexations deliberately planned by European cabinets. It seemed to be assumed that Asia was to be divided among the powers
                                    of Europe, and each was anxious to get its share or more.</p>
                                <p>The advance of Russia in Asia is entirely different from that of the other powers, since it has taken place by land and not
                                    by sea. Though the geographical extent of Russian territory and influence is enormous, she has always moved along the line
                                    of least resistance. She is a moderately strong empire lying to the north of the great Moslem states, and having for
                                    neighbours a series of very weak principalities or semi-civilized tribes. The conquest of Siberia and central Asia presented
                                    no real difficulties: Persia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name>
                                    were left on one side, and Russia was defeated as soon as she was opposed by a vigorous power in the Far East. As the
                                    Russian possessions in Asia are continuous with European Russia, it is only natural that they should have been russified far
                                    more thoroughly than the British possessions have been anglicized.</p>
                                <p>There has been great difference of opinion as to the extent to which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name>'s conquests influenced Asia, and it is equally
                                    hard to say what is the effect now being produced by Europe. Clearly such alterations as the construction of railways in
                                    nearly all parts of the continent, and the establishment of peace over formerly disturbed areas like India, are of enormous
                                    importance, and must change the life of the people. But the mental constitution of Asiatics is less easily modified than
                                    their institutions, and even Japan has assimilated European methods rather than European ideas.</p>

                        <p>In common usage, however, the word implies no more than a somewhat vague idea of size and dignity, and is loosely applied to any
                            large centre of population. Thus while, technically, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London">"the City
                                of London"</name>. is quite small, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> is yet properly
                            described as the largest city in the world. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United
                                States</name> this use of the word is still more loose, and any town, whether technically a city or not, is usually so
                            designated, with little regard to its actual size or importance.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from the above that the word <q>"city"</q> is incapable of any very clear and inclusive definition, and the attempt to
                            show that historically it possesses a meaning that clearly differentiates it from <q>"town"</q> or <q>"borough"</q> has led to some
                            controversy. As the translation of the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">πόλις</hi>
                            </foreign> or Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi>
                            </foreign> it involves the ancient conception of the state or <q>"city-state,"</q>
                            i.e. of the state as not too large to prevent its government through the body of the citizens assembled in the <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">agora</hi>
                            </foreign>, and is applied not to the place but to the whole body politic. From this
                            conception both the word and its dignified connotation are without doubt historically derived. On the occupation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name> the Gallic states and tribes were called <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">civitates</hi>

                            towns of the various administrative districts. These were also the seats of the bishops. It is thus affirmed that in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> from the 5th to the 15th century the name <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            the see of a bishop. It is true, indeed, that the actual sees in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> all have a formal right to the title; the boroughs erected into episcopal sees by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII</name> thereby became <q>"cities"</q>; but towns such as

                            incorporated and were once episcopal sees. On the other hand, it has only been since the latter part of the 19th century that the
                            official style of <q>"city"</q> has, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United

                        <p>The word <q>" civilization"</q> is an obvious derivative of the Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            </foreign>, a

                            </foreign>, pertaining to a citizen. Etymologically speaking,
                            then, it would be putting no undue strain upon the word to interpret it as having to do with the entire period of human progress
                            since mankind attained sufficient intelligence and social unity to develop a system of government. But in practice <q>" civilization
                                "</q> is usually interpreted in a somewhat narrower sense, as having application solely to the most recent and comparatively
                            brief period of time that has elapsed since the most highly developed races of men have used systems of writing. This restricted
                            usage is probably explicable, in part at least, by the fact that the word, though distinctly modern in origin, is nevertheless older
                            than the interpretation of social evolution that now finds universal acceptance. Only very recently has it come to be understood
                            that primitive societies vastly antedating the historical period had attained relatively high stages of development and fixity,
                            socially and politically. Now that this is understood, however, nothing but an arbitrary and highly inconvenient restriction of
                            meanings can prevent us from speaking of the citizens of these early societies as having attained certain stages of civilization. It
                            will be convenient, then, in outlining the successive stages of human progress here, to include under the comprehensive term <q>"
                                civilization "</q> those long earlier periods of <q>" savagery "</q> and <q>" barbarism "</q> as well as the more recent period
                            of higher development to which the word <q>" civilization "</q> is sometimes restricted.</p>

                        <p>Adequate proof that civilization as we now know it is the result of a long, slow process of evolution was put forward not long after
                            the middle of the 19th century by the students of palaeontology and of prehistoric archaeology. A recognition of the fact that
                            primitive man used implements of chipped flint, of polished stone, and of the softer metals for successive ages, before he attained
                            a decree of technical skill and knowledge that would enable him to smelt iron, led the Danish archaeologists to classify the stages
                            of human progress under these captions: the Rough Stone Age ; the Age of Polished Stone ; the Age of Bronze ; and the Age of Iron.
                            These terms acquired almost universal recognition, and they retain popularity as affording a very broad outline of the story of
                            human progress. It is obviously desirable, however, to fill in the outlines of the story more in detail. To some extent it has been
                            possible to do so, largely through the efforts of ethnologists who have studied the social conditions of existing races of savages.
                            A recognition of the principle that, broadly speaking, progress has everywhere been achieved along the same lines and through the
                            same sequence of changes, makes it possible to interpret the past history of the civilized races of to-day in the light of the
                            present-day conditions of other races that are still existing under social and political conditions of a more primitive type. Such
                            races as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Māori">the Maoris</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">the American Indians</name> have furnished invaluable
                            information to the student of social evolution; and the knowledge thus gained has been extended and fortified by the ever-expanding
                            researches of the palaeontologist and archaeologist.</p>
                        <p>Thus it has become possible to present with some confidence a picture showing the successive stages of human development during the
                            long dark period when our prehistoric ancestor was advancing along the toilsome and tortuous but on the whole always uprising path
                            from lowest savagery to the stage of relative enlightenment at which we find him at the so-called <q>" dawnings of history."</q>
                            That he was for long ages a savage before he attained sufficient culture to be termed, in modern phraseology, a barbarian, admits of
                            no question. Equally little in doubt is it that other long ages of barbarism preceded the final ascent to civilization. The precise
                            period of time covered by these successive <q>" Ages "</q> is of course only conjectural; but something like one hundred thousand
                            years may perhaps be taken as a safe minimal estimate. At the beginning of this long period the most advanced race of men must be
                            thought of as a promiscuous company of pre-troglodytic mammals, at least partially arboreal in habit, living on uncooked fruits and
                            vegetables, and possessed of no arts and crafts whatever—not even of the knowledge of the rudest implement. At the end of the
                            period, there emerges into the more or less clear light of history a large-brained being, living in houses of elaborate
                            construction, supplying himself with divers luxuries through the aid of a multitude of elaborate handicrafts, associated with his
                            fellows under the sway of highly organized governments, and satisfying aesthetic needs through the practice of pictorial and
                            literary arts of a high order. How was this amazing transformation brought about?</p>

                        <p>If an answer can be found to that query, we shall have a clue to all human progress, not only during the prehistoric but also during
                            the historic periods ; for we may well believe that recent progress has not departed from the scheme of development impressed on
                            humanity during that long apprenticeship. Ethnologists believe that an answer can be found. They believe that the metamorphosis from
                            beast-like savage to cultured civilian may be proximally explained (certain potentialities and attributes of the species being taken
                            for granted) as the result of accumulated changes that found their initial impulses in a half-dozen or so of practical inventions.
                            Stated thus, the explanation seems absurdly simple. Confessedly it supplies only a proximal, not a final, analysis of the forces
                            impelling mankind along the pathway of progress. But it has the merit of tangibility; it presents certain highly important facts of
                            human history vividly : and it furnishes a definite and fairly satisfactory basis for marking successive stages of incipient
                            civilization.</p>
                        <p>In outlining the story of primitive man's advancement, upon such a basis, we may follow the scheme of one of the most philosophical
                            of ethnologists, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lewis_H._Morgan">Lewis H. Morgan</name>, who made a

                            bestiality to civilization into six successive periods, which he names respectively the Older, Middle and Later periods of Savagery,
                            and the Older, Middle and Later periods of Barbarism.</p>

                        <p>The Middle Period of Savagery began with a knowledge of the uses of fire. This wonderful discovery enabled the developing race to
                            extend its habitat almost indefinitely, and to include flesh, and in particular fish, in its regular dietary. Man could now leave
                            the forests, and wander along the shores and rivers, migrating to climates less enervating than those to which he had previously
                            been confined. Doubtless he became an expert fisher, but he was as yet poorly equipped for hunting, being provided, probably, with
                            no weapon more formidable than a crude hatchet and a roughly fashioned spear. The primitive races of Australia and Polynesia had not
                            advanced beyond this middle status of savagery when they were discovered a few generations ago. It is obvious, then, that in dealing
                            with the further progress of nascent civilization we have to do with certain favoured portions of the race, which sought out new
                            territories and developed new capacities while many tribes of their quondam peers remained static and hence by comparison seemed to
                            retrograde.</p>

                        <p>The next great epochal discovery, in virtue of which a portion of the race advanced to the Upper Status of Savagery, was that of the
                            bow and arrow,—a truly wonderful implement. The possessor of this device could bring down the fleetest animal and could defend
                            himself against the most predatory. He could provide himself not only with food but with materials for clothing and for tent-making,
                            and thus could migrate at will back from the seas and large rivers, and far into inhospitable but invigorating temperate and
                            sub-Arctic regions. The meat diet, now for the first time freely available, probably contributed, along with the stimulating
                            climate, to increase the physical vigour and courage of this highest savage, thus urging him along the paths of progress.
                            Nevertheless many tribes came thus far and no farther, as witness <name type="people">the Athapascans</name> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hudson_Bay">the Hudson's Bay</name> Territory and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">the Indians</name> of the valley of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbia_River">the Columbia</name>.</p>

                        <p>We now come to the marvellous discovery that enabled our ancestor to make such advances upon the social conditions of his forbears as
                            to entitle him, in the estimate of his remote descendants, to be considered as putting savagery behind him and as entering upon the
                            Lower Status of Barbarism. The discovery in question had to do with the practice of the art of making pottery (see CERAMICS).
                            Hitherto man had been possessed of no permanent utensils that could withstand the action of fire. He could not readily boil water
                            except by some such cumbersome method as the dropping of heated stones into a wooden or skin receptacle. The effect upon his dietary
                            of having at hand earthen vessels in which meat and herbs could be boiled over a fire must have been momentous. Various meats and
                            many vegetables become highly palatable when boiled that are almost or quite inedible when merely roasted before a fire. Bones,
                            sinews and even hides may be made to give up a modicum of nutriment in this way; and doubtless barbaric man, before whom starvation
                            always loomed threateningly, found the crude pot an almost perennial refuge. And of course its use as a cooking utensil was only one
                            of many ways in which the newly discovered mechanism exerted a civilizing influence.</p>

                        <p>The next great progressive movement, which carried man into the Middle Status of Barbarism, is associated with the domestication of
                            animals in the Eastern hemisphere, and with the use of irrigation in cultivating the soil and of adobe bricks and stone in
                            architecture in the Western hemisphere. The dog was probably the first animal to be domesticated, but the sheep, the ox, the camel
                            and the horse were doubtless added in relatively rapid succession, so soon as the idea that captive animals could be of service had
                            been clearly conceived. Man now became a herdsman, no longer dependent for food upon the precarious chase of wild animals. Milk,
                            procurable at all seasons, made a highly important addition to his dietary. With the aid of camel and horse he could traverse wide
                            areas hitherto impassable, and come in contact with distant peoples. Thus commerce came to play an extended role in the
                            dissemination of both commodities and ideas. In particular the nascent civilization of the Mediterranean region fell heir to
                            numerous products of farther Asia,—gums, spices, oils, and most important of all, the cereals. The cultivation of the latter gave
                            the finishing touch to a comprehensive and varied diet, while emphasizing the value of a fixed abode. For the first time it now
                            became possible for large numbers of people to form localized communities. A natural consequence was the elaboration of political
                            systems, which, however, proceeded along lines already suggested by the experience of earlier epochs. All this tended to establish
                            and emphasize the idea of nationality, based primarily on blood-relationship ; and at the same time to develop within the community
                            itself the idea of property, —that is to say, of valuable or desirable commodities which have come into the possession of an
                            individual through his enterprise or labour, and which should therefore be subject to his voluntary disposal. At an earlier stage of
                            development, all property had been of communal, not of individual, ownership. It appears, then, that our mid-period barbarian had
                            attained—if the verbal contradiction be permitted—a relatively high stage of civilization.</p>

                        <p>There remained, however, one master craft of which he had no conception. This was the art of smelting iron. When, ultimately, his
                            descendants learned the wonderful secrets of that art, they rose in consequence to the Upper Status of Barbarism. This culminating
                            practical invention, it will be observed, is the first of the great discoveries with which we have to do that was not primarily
                            concerned with the question of man's food supply. Iron, to be sure, has abundant uses in the same connexion, but its most direct and
                            obvious utilities have to do with weapons of war and with implements calculated to promote such arts of peace as housebuilding,
                            road-making and the construction of vehicles. Wood and stone could now be fashioned as never before. Houses could be built and
                            cities walled with unexampled facility; to say nothing of the making of a multitude of minor implements and utensils hitherto quite
                            unknown, or at best rare and costly. Nor must we overlook the aesthetic influence of edged implements, with which wood and stone
                            could readily be sculptured when placed in the hands of a race that had long been accustomed to scratch the semblance of living
                            forms on bone or ivory and to fashion crude images of clay. In a word, man, the <q>" tool-making animal,"</q> was now for the first
                            time provided with tools worthy of his wonderful hands and yet more wonderful brain.</p>
                        <p>Thus through the application of one revolutionary invention after another, the most advanced races of men had arrived, after long
                            ages of effort, at a relatively high stage of development. A very wide range of experiences had enabled man to evolve a complex body
                            politic, based on a fairly secure social basis, and his brain had correspondingly developed into a relatively efficient and stable
                            organ of thought. But as yet he had devised no means of communicating freely with other people at a distance except through the
                            medium of verbal messages; nor had he any method by which he could transmit his experiences to posterity more securely than by
                            fugitive and fallible oral traditions. A vague symbolization of his achievements was preserved from generation to generation in
                            myth-tale and epic, but he knew not how to make permanent record of his history. Until he could devise a means to make such record,
                            he must remain, in the estimate of his descendants, a barbarian, though he might be admitted to have become a highly organized and
                            even in a broad sense a cultured being.</p>

                        <p>At length, however, this last barrier was broken. Some race or races devised a method of symbolizing events and ultimately of making
                            even abstruse ideas tangible by means of graphic signs. In other words, a system of writing was developed. Man thus achieved a
                            virtual conquest over time; <pb n="405" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0405.png"/> as he had earlier conquered space. He could now transmit the record of his deeds and his
                            thoughts to remote posterity. Thus he stood at the portals of what later generations would term secure history. He had graduated out
                            of barbarism, and become in the narrower sense of the word a civilized being. Henceforth, his knowledge, his poetical dreamings, his
                            moral aspirations might be recorded in such form as to be read not merely by his contemporaries but by successive generations of
                            remote posterity. The inspiring character of such a message is obvious. The validity of making this great culminating intellectual
                            achievement the test of <q>" civilized "</q> existence need not be denied. But we should ill comprehend the character of the message
                            which the earlier generations of civilized beings transmit to us from the period which we term the <q>"dawning of history"</q> did
                            we not bear constantly in mind the long series of progressive stages of <q>" savagery "</q> and <q>" barbarism "</q> that of
                            necessity preceded the final stage of <q>" civilization"</q> proper. The achievements of those earlier stages afforded the secure
                            foundation for the progress of the future. A multitude of minor arts, in addition to the important ones just outlined, had been
                            developed; and for a long time civilized man was to make no other epochal addition to the list of accomplishments that came to him
                            as a heritage from his barbaric progenitor. Indeed, even to this day the list of such additions is not a long one, nor, judged in
                            the relative scale, so important as might at first thought be supposed. Whoever considers the subject carefully must admit the force
                            of <ref>

                                a barbarian, considered in their relation to the sum of human progress, <quote>" transcend, in relative importance, all his

                        <p>Without insisting on this comparison, however, let us ask what discoveries and inventions man has made within the historical period
                            that may fairly be ranked with the half-dozen great epochal achievements that have been put forward as furnishing the keys to all
                            the progress of the prehistoric periods. In other words, let us sketch the history of progress during the ten thousand years or so
                            that have elapsed since man learned the art of writing, adapting our sketch to the same scale which we have already applied to the
                            unnumbered millenniums of the prehistoric period. The view of world-history thus outlined will be a very different one from what
                            might be expected by the student of national history; but it will present the essentials of the progress of civilization in a
                            suggestive light.</p>

                        <p>Without pretending to fix an exact date,—which the historical records do not at present permit,—we may assume that the most advanced
                            race of men elaborated a system of writing not less than six thousand years before the beginning of the Christian era. Holding to
                            the terminology already suggested for the earlier periods, we may speak of man's position during the ensuing generations as that of
                            the First or Lowest Status of civilization. If we review the history of this period we shall find that it extends unbroken over a
                            stretch of at least four or five thousand years. During the early part of this period such localized civilizations as those of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egyptians">the Egyptians</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sumer">the Sumerians</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">the Babylonians</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hittites">the Hittites</name> rose, grew strong
                            and passed beyond their meridian. This suggests that we must now admit the word <q>" civilization "</q> to yet another definition,
                            within its larger meaning : we must speak of <q>" a civilization,"</q> as that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name>, of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>, and we must understand
                            thereby a localized phase of society bearing the same relation to civilization as a whole that a wave bears to the ocean or a tree
                            to the forest. Such other localized civilizations as those of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia">Phoenicia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage">Carthage</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium">Byzantium</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sassanid_Empire">the Sassanids</name>, in due
                            course waxed and waned, leaving a tremendous imprint on national history, but creating only minor and transitory ripples in the
                            great ocean of civilization. Progress in the elaboration of the details of earlier methods and inventions took place as a matter of
                            course. Some nation, probably <name type="people">the Phoenicians</name>, gave a new impetus to the art of writing by developing a
                            phonetic alphabet; but this achievement, remarkable as it was in itself, added nothing fundamental to human capacity. Literatures
                            had previously flourished through the use of hieroglyphic and syllabic symbols; and the Babylonian syllables continued in vogue
                            throughout western Asia for a long time after the Phoenician alphabet had demonstrated its intrinsic superiority.</p>
                        <p>Similarly the art of Egyptian and Assyrian and Greek was but the elaboration and perfection of methods that barbaric man had
                            practised away back in the days when he was a cave-dweller. The weapons of warfare of Greek and Roman were the spear and the bow and
                            arrow that their ancestors had used in the period of savagery, aided by sword and helmet dating from the upper period of barbarism.
                            Greek and Roman government at their best were founded upon the system of <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            </foreign> that barbaric man had profoundly studied,—as witness, for example, the federal system of the barbaric

                            better roads and larger cities, than their predecessors, these are but matters of detailed development, the like of which had marked
                            the progress of the more important arts and the introduction of less important ancillary ones in each antecedent period. The axe of
                            steel is no new implement, but a mere perfecting of the axe of chipped flint. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ILiad">The

                        <p>Thus for six or seven thousand years after man achieved civilization there was rhythmic progress in many lines, but there came no
                            great epochal invention to usher in a new ethnic period. Then, towards the close of what historians of to-day are accustomed to call
                                <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>, there appeared in rapid sequence three
                            or four inventions and a great scientific discovery that, taken together, were destined to change the entire aspect of European
                            civilization. The inventions were gunpowder, the mariner's compass, paper and the printing-press, three of which appear to have been
                            brought into Europe by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moors">the Moors</name>, whether or not they originated
                            in the remote East. The scientific discovery which must be coupled with these inventions was the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Copernican</name> demonstration that the sun and not the earth is the
                            centre of our planetary system. The generations of men that found themselves <list>
                                <item>(1) confronted with the revolutionary conception of the universe given by the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Copernican</name> theory ;</item>

                            </list>—such generations of men might well be said to have entered upon a new ethnic period. The transition in their mode of thought
                            and in their methods of practical life was as great as can be supposed to have resulted, in an early generation, from the
                            introduction of iron, or in a yet earlier from the invention of the bow and arrow. So the Europeans of about the 15th century of the
                            Christian era may be said to have entered upon the Second or Middle Status of civilization.</p>

                            man is enormously old, and that man himself instead of deteriorating from a single perfect pair six thousand years removed, has
                            ascended from bestiality through a slow process of evolution extending over hundreds of centuries. The revolution in practical life
                            and in the mental life of our race that followed these inventions and this new presentation of truth probably exceeded in suddenness
                            and in its far-reaching effects the metamorphosis effected at any previous transition from one ethnic period to another. The men of
                            the 19th century, living now in the period that may be termed the Upper Status <pb n="406" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0406.png"/> of civilization, saw such changes
                            effected in the practical affairs of their everyday lives as had not been wrought before during the entire historical period. Their
                            fathers had travelled in vehicles drawn by horses, quite as their remoter ancestors had done since the time of higher barbarism. It
                            may be doubted whether there existed in the world in the year 1800 a postal service that could compare in speed and efficiency with
                            the express service of the Romans of the time of Caesar; far less was there a telegraph service that could compare with that of the
                            ancient Persians. Nor was there a ship sailing the seas that a Phoenician trireme might not have overhauled. But now within the
                            lifetime of a single man the world was covered with a network of steel rails on which locomotives drew gigantic vehicles, laden with
                            passengers at an hourly speed almost equalling Caesar's best journey of a day; over the land and under the seas were stretched wires
                            along which messages coursed from continent to continent literally with the speed of lightning ; and the waters of the earth were
                            made to teem with gigantic craft propelled without sail or oar at a speed which the Phoenician captain of three thousand years ago
                            and the English captain of the 18th century would alike have held incredible.</p>

                        <p>There is no need to give further details here of the industrial revolutions that have been achieved in this newest period of
                            civilization, since in their broader outlines at least they are familiar to every one. Nor need we dwell upon the revolution in
                            thought whereby man has for the first time been given a clear inkling as to his origin and destiny. It suffices to point out that
                            such periods of fermentation of ideas as this suggests have probably always been concomitant with those outbursts of creative genius
                            that gave the world the practical inventions upon which human progress has been conditioned. The same attitude of receptivity to new
                            ideas is pre-requisite to one form of discovery as to the other. Nor, it may be added, can either form of idea become effective for
                            the progress of civilization except in proportion as a large body of any given generation are prepared to receive it. Doubtless here
                            and there a dreamer played with fire, in a literal sense, for generations before the utility of fire as a practical aid to human
                            progress came to be recognized in practice. And— to seek an illustration at the other end of the scale—we know that the advanced
                            thinkers of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> believed in the antiquity of the earth and in the evolution of man
                            two thousand years before the coming of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name>. We have
                            but partly solved the mysteries of the progress of civilization, then, when we have pointed out that each tangible stage of progress
                            owed its initiative to a new invention or discovery of science. To go to the root of the matter we must needs explain how it came
                            about that a given generation of men was in mental mood to receive the new invention or discovery.</p>
                        <p>The pursuit of this question would carry us farther into the realm of communal and racial psychology—to say nothing of the realm of
                            conjecture—than comports with the purpose of this article. It must suffice to point out that alertness of mind— that all
                            mentality—is, in the last analysis, a reaction to the influences of the environment. It follows that man may subject himself to new
                            influences and thus give his mind a new stimulus by changing his habitat. A fundamental secret of progress is revealed in this fact.
                            Man probably never would have evolved from savagery had he remained in the Tropics where he doubtless originated. But successive
                            scientific inventions enabled him, as has been suggested, to migrate to distant latitudes, and thus more or less involuntarily to
                            become the recipient of new creative and progressive impulses. After migrations in many directions had resulted in the development
                            of divers races, each with certain capacities and acquirements due to its unique environment, there was opportunity for the
                            application of the principle of environmental stimulus in an indirect way, through the mingling and physical intermixture of one
                            race with another. Each of the great localized civilizations of antiquity appears to have owed its prominence in part at
                            least—perhaps very largely—to such intermingling of two or more races. Each of these civilizations began to decay so soon as the
                            nation had remained for a considerable number of generations in its localized environment, and had practically ceased to receive
                            accretions from distant races at approximately the same stage of development. There is a suggestive lesson for present-day
                            civilization in that thought-compelling fact. Further evidence of the application of the principle of environmental stimulus,
                            operating through changed habitat and racial intermixture, is furnished by the virility of the colonial peoples of our own day. The
                            receptiveness to new ideas and the rapidity of material progress of Americans, South Africans and Australians are proverbial. No one
                            doubts, probably, that one or another of these countries will give a new stimulus to the progress of civilization, through the
                            promulgation of some great epochal discovery, in the not distant future. Again, the value of racial intermingling is shown yet
                            nearer home in the long-continued vitality of the British nation, which is explicable, in some measure at least, by the fact that
                            the Celtic element held aloof from the Anglo-Saxon element century after century sufficiently to maintain racial integrity, yet
                            mingled sufficiently to give and receive the fresh stimulus of <q>" new blood."</q> It is interesting in this connexion to examine
                            the map of Great Britain with reference to the birthplaces of the men named above as being the originators of the inventions and
                            discoveries that made the close of the 18th century memorable as ushering in a new ethnic era. It may be added that these names
                            suggest yet another element in the causation of progress : the fact, namely, that, however necessary racial receptivity may be to
                            the dynamitic upheaval of a new ethnic era, it is after all <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> genius that applies its detonating

                            civilization above given, prior to characterizing it from another standpoint. It appears that the entire period of human progress up
                            to the present may be divided into nine periods which, if of necessity more or less arbitrary, yet are not without certain warrant
                            of logic. They may be defined as follows : <list>

                                <item>(9) The Upper Period of Civilization, which is still in progress, but which, as will be suggested in a moment, is probably
                                    nearing its termination.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>It requires but a glance at the characteristics of these successive epochs to show the ever-increasing complexity of the inventions
                            that delimit them and of the conditions of life that they connote. Were we to attempt to characterize in a few phrases the entire
                            story of achievement thus outlined, we might say that during the three stages of Savagery man was attempting to make himself master
                            of the geographical climates. His unconscious ideal was, to gain a foothold and the means of subsistence in every zone. During the
                            three periods of Barbarism the ideal of conquest was extended to the beasts of the field, the vegetable world, and the mineral
                            contents of the earth's crust. During the three periods of Civilization proper the ideal of conquest has become still more
                            intellectual and subtle, being now extended to such abstractions as an analysis of speech-sounds, and to such intangibles as
                            expanding gases and still more elusive electric currents : in other words, to the forces of nature, no less than to tangible
                            substances. Hand in hand with this growing complexity of man's relations with the external world has gone a like increase of
                            complexity in the social and political organizations that characterize man's relations with his fellow- <pb n="407" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0407.png"/> men. In
                            savagery the family expanded into the tribe; in barbarism the tribe developed into the nation. The epoch of civilization proper is
                            aptly named, because it has been a time in which citizenship, in the narrower national significance, has probably been developed to
                            its apogee. Throughout this period, in every land, the highest virtue has been considered to be patriotism,—by which must be
                            understood an instinctive willingness on the part of every individual to defend even with his life the interests of the nation into
                            which he chances to be born, regardless of whether the national cause in which he struggles be in any given case good or bad, right
                            or wrong. The communal judgment of this epoch pronounces any man a traitor who will not uphold his own nation even in a wrong
                            cause—and the word <q>" traitor "</q> marks the utmost brand of ignominy.</p>

                        <p>But while the idea of nationality has thus been accentuated, there has been a never-ending struggle within the bounds of the nation
                            itself to adjust the relations of one citizen to another. The ideas that might makes right, that the strong man must dominate the
                            weak, that leadership in the community properly belongs to the man who is physically most competent to lead—these ideas were a
                            perfectly natural, and indeed an inevitable, outgrowth of the conditions under which man fought his way up through savagery and
                            barbarism. Man in the first period of civilization inherited these ideas, along with the conditions of society that were their
                            concomitants. So throughout the periods when the oriental civilizations of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> and Persia were dominant, a
                            despotic form of government was accepted as the natural order of things. It does not appear that any other form was even considered
                            as a practicality. A despot might indeed be overthrown, but only to make way for the coronation of another despot. A little later
                            the Greeks and Romans modified the conception of a heaven-sent individual monarch; but they went no further than to substitute a
                            heaven-favoured community, with specially favoured groups <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">(Patricii)</hi>
                            </foreign> within
                            the community. With this, national egoism reached its climax ; for each people regarded its own citizens as the only exemplars of
                            civilization, openly branding all the rest of the world as <q>" barbarians,"</q> fit subjects for the exaction of tribute or for the
                            imposition of the bonds of actual slavery. During <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                                ages</name> there was a reaction towards individualism as opposed to nationalism: but the entire system of feudalism, with its
                            clearly recognized conditions of over-lordship and of vassaldom, gave expression, no less clearly than oriental despotism and
                            classical <q>" democracy "</q> had done, to the idea of individual inequality ; of divergence of moral and legal status based on
                            natural inheritance. Thus this idea, a reminiscence of barbarism, maintained its dominance throughout the first period of
                            civilization.</p>
                        <p>But gunpowder, marking the transition to the second period of civilization, came as a great levelling influence. With its aid the
                            weakest peasant might prove more than a match for the most powerful knight. Before its assaults the castle of the lord ceased to be
                            an impregnable fortress. And while gunpowder thus levelled down the power of the mighty, the printing-press levelled up the
                            intelligence, and hence the power and influence of the lowly. Meantime the mariner's compass opened up new territories beyond the
                            seas, and in due course men of lowly origin were seen to attain to wealth and power through commercial pursuits, thus tending to
                            break in upon the established social order. In the colonial territories themselves all men were subjected more or less to the same
                            perils and dependent upon their own efforts. Success and prominence in the community came not as a birthright, but as the result of
                            demonstrated fitness. The great lesson that the interests of all members of a community are, in the last analysis, mutual could be
                            more clearly distinguished in these small colonies than in larger and older bodies politic. Through various channels, therefore, in
                            the successive generations of this middle period of civilization, the idea gained ground that intelligence and moral worth, rather
                            than physical prowess, should be the test of greatness; that it is incumbent on the strong in the interests of the body politic to
                            protect the weak; and that, in the long run, the best interests of the community are conserved if all its members, without
                            exception, are given moral equality before the law. This idea of equal rights and privileges for all members of the community—for
                            each individual <q>" the greatest amount of liberty consistent with a like liberty of every other individual "</q>—first found
                            expression as a philosophical doctrine towards the close of the 18th century ; at which time also tentative efforts were made to put
                            it into practice. It may be said therefore to represent the culminating sociological doctrine of the middle period of
                            civilization,—the ideal towards which all the influences of the period had tended to impel the race.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed, however, that this ideal of individual equality within the body politic in no direct wise influences the status
                            of the body politic itself as the centre of a localized civilization that, may be regarded as in a sense antagonistic to all other
                            similarly localized civilizations. If there were any such influence, it would rather operate in the direction of accentuating the
                            patriotism of the member of a democratical community, as against that of the subject of a despot, through the sense of personal
                            responsibility developed in the former. The developments of the middle period of civilization cannot be considered, therefore, to
                            have tended to decrease the spirit of nationality, with its concomitant penalty of what is sometimes called provincialism. The
                            history of this entire period, as commonly presented, is largely made up of the records of international rivalries and jealousies,
                            perennially culminating in bitterly contested wars. It was only towards the close of the epoch that the desirability of free
                            commercial intercourse among nations began to find expression as a philosophical creed through the efforts of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Quesnay">Quesnay</name> and his followers ; and the doctrine that both parties to an
                            international commercial transaction are gainers thereby found its first clear expression in the year 1776 in the pages of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Étienne_Bonnot_de_Condillac">Condillac</name> and of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adam_Smith">Adam Smith</name>.</p>
                        <p>But the discoveries that ushered in the third period of civilization were destined to work powerfully from the outset for the
                            breaking down of international barriers, though, of course, their effects would not be at once manifest. Thus the substitution of
                            steam power for water power, besides giving a tremendous impetus to manufacturing in general, mapped out new industrial centres in
                            regions that nature had supplied with coal but not always with other raw materials. To note a single result, England became the
                            manufacturing centre of the world, drawing its raw materials from every corner of the globe; but in so doing it ceased to be
                            self-supporting as regards the production of food-supplies. While growing in national wealth, as a result of the new inventions,
                            England has therefore lost immeasurably in national self-sufficiency and independence; having become in large measure dependent upon
                            other countries both for the raw materials without which her industries must perish and for the foods to maintain the very life of
                            her people.</p>
                        <p>What is true of England in this regard is of course true in greater or less measure of all other countries. Everywhere, thanks to the
                            new mechanisms that increase industrial efficiency, there has been an increasing tendency to specialization; and since the
                            manufacturer must often find his raw materials in one part of the world and his markets in another, this implies an ever-increasing
                            intercommunication and interdependence between the nations. This spirit is obviously fostered by the new means of transportation by
                            locomotive and steamship, and by the electric communication that enables the Londoner, for example, to transact business in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> or in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokyo">Tokio</name> with scarcely an hour's delay ; and that puts every one in touch at
                            to-day's breakfast table with the happenings of the entire world. Thanks to the new mechanisms, national isolation is no longer
                            possible ; globe-trotting has become a habit with thousands of individuals of many nations; and Orient and Occident, representing
                            civilizations that for thousands of years were almost absolutely severed and mutually oblivious of each other, have been brought
                            again into close touch for mutual education and betterment. The Western mind has learned with amazement that the aforetime <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">Terra Incognita</hi>
                            </foreign> of the far East has nurtured a gigantic civilization having
                            ideals in many ways far different from our own. The Eastern mind has proved itself capable, in <pb n="408" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0408.png"/> self-defence, of
                            absorbing the essential practicalities of Western civilization within a single generation. Some of the most important problems of
                            world-civilization of the immediate future hinge upon the mutual relations of these two long-severed communities, branched at some
                            early stage of progress to opposite hemispheres of the globe, but now brought by the new mechanisms into daily and even hourly
                            communication.</p>

                        <p>While the new conditions of the industrial world have thus tended to develop a new national outlook, there has come about, as a
                            result of the scientific discoveries already referred to, a no less significant broadening of the mental and spiritual horizons.
                            Here also the trend is away from the narrowly egoistic and towards the cosmopolitan view. About the middle of the 19th century <name type="person">Dr Pritchard</name>
                            <note type="uncertainty" resp="#gorobiy">There were many people called Pritchard (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritchard), but
                                the exact identification is uncertain. – Alexey Gorobiy</note> declared that many people debated whether it might not be
                            permissible for the Australian settlers to shoot the natives as food for their dogs ; some of the disputants arguing that savages
                            were without the pale of human brotherhood. To-day the thesis that all mankind are one brotherhood needs no defence. The most
                            primitive of existing aborigines are regarded merely as brethren who, through some defect or neglect of opportunity, have lagged
                            behind in the race. Similarly the defective and criminal classes that make up so significant a part of the population of even our
                            highest present-day civilizations, are no longer regarded with anger or contempt, as beings who are suffering just punishment for
                            wilful transgressions, but are considered as pitiful victims of hereditary and environmental influences that they could neither
                            choose nor control. Insanity is no longer thought of as demoniac possession, but as the most lamentable of diseases.</p>
                        <p>The changed attitude towards savage races and defective classes affords tangible illustrations of a fundamental transformation of
                            point of view which doubtless represents the most important result of the operation of new scientific knowledge in the course of the
                            19th century. It is a transformation that is only partially effected as yet, to be sure ; but it is rapidly making headway, and when
                            fully achieved it will represent, probably, the most radical metamorphosis of mental view that has taken place in the entire course
                            of the historical period. The essence of the new view is this: to recognize the universality and the invariability of natural law;
                            stated otherwise, to understand that the word <q>" supernatural"</q> involves a contradiction of terms and has in fact no meaning.
                            Whoever has grasped the full import of this truth is privileged to sweep mental horizons wider by far than ever opened to the view
                            of any thinker of an earlier epoch. He is privileged to forecast, as the sure heritage of the future, a civilization freed from the
                            last ghost of superstition— an Age of Reason in which mankind shall at last find refuge from the hosts of occult and invisible
                            powers, the fearsome galaxies of deities and demons, which have haunted him thus far at every stage of his long journey through
                            savagery, barbarism and civilization. Doubtless here and there a thinker, even in the barbaric eras, may have realized that these
                            ghosts that so influenced the everyday lives of his fellows were but children of the imagination. But the certainty that such is the
                            case could not have come with the force of demonstration even to the most clear-sighted thinker until 19th-century science had
                            investigated with penetrating vision the realm of molecule and atom; had revealed the awe-inspiring principle of the conservation of
                            energy; and had offered a comprehensible explanation of the evolution of one form of life from another, from monad to man, that did
                            not presuppose the intervention of powers more <q>" supernatural"</q> than those that operate about us everywhere to-day.</p>
                        <p>The stupendous import of these new truths could not, of course, make itself evident to the generality of mankind in a single
                            generation, when opposed to superstitions of a thousand generations' standing. But the new knowledge has made its way more
                            expeditiously than could have been anticipated; and its effects are seen on every side, even where its agency is scarcely
                            recognized. As a single illustration, we may note the familiar observation that the entire complexion of orthodox teaching of
                            religion has been more altered in the past fifty years than in two thousand years before. This of course is not entirely due to the
                            influence of physical and biological science; no effect has a unique cause, in the complex sociological scheme. Archaeology,
                            comparative philology and textual criticism have also contributed their share; and the comparative study of religions has further
                            tended to broaden the outlook and to make for universality, as opposed to insularity, of view. It is coming to be more and more
                            widely recognized that all theologies are but the reflex of the more or less faulty knowledge of the times in which they originate;
                            that the true and abiding purpose of religion should be the practical betterment of humanity—the advancement of civilization in the
                            best sense of the word ; and that this end may perhaps be best subserved by different systems of theology, adapted to the varied
                            genius of different times and divers races. Wherefore there is not the same enthusiastic desire to-day that found expression a
                            generation ago, to impose upon the cultured millions of the East a religion that seems to them alien to their manner of thought,
                            unsuited to their needs and less distinctly ethical in teaching than their own religions.</p>
                        <p>Such are but a few of the illustrations that might be cited from many fields to suggest that the mind of our generation is becoming
                            receptive to a changed point of view that augurs the coming of a new ethnic era. If one may be permitted to enter very tentatively
                            the field of prophecy, it seems not unlikely that the great revolutionary invention which will close the third period of
                            civilization and usher in a new era is already being evolved. It seems not over-hazardous to predict that the air-ship, in one form
                            or another, is destined to be the mechanism that will give the new impetus to human civilization; that the next era will have as one
                            of its practical ideals the conquest of the air; and that this conquest will become a factor in the final emergence of humanity from
                            the insularity of nationalism to the broad view of cosmopolitanism, towards which, as we have seen, the tendencies of the present
                            era are verging. That the gap to be covered is a vastly wide one no one need be reminded who recalls that the civilized nations of
                            Europe, together with America and Japan, are at present accustomed to spend more than three hundred million pounds each year merely
                            that they may keep armaments in readiness to fly at one another's throats should occasion arise. Formidable as these armaments now
                            seem, however, the developments of the not very distant future will probably make them quite obsolete; and sooner or later, as
                            science develops yet more deadly implements of destruction, the time must come when communal intelligence will rebel at the suicidal
                            folly of the international attitude that characterized, for example, the opening decade of the 20th century. At some time, after the
                            first period of cosmopolitanism shall be ushered in as a tenth ethnic period, it will come to be recognized that there is a word
                            fraught with fuller meanings even than the word patriotism. That word is humanitarianism. The enlightened generation that realizes
                            the full implications of that word will doubtless marvel that their ancestors of the third period of civilization should have risen
                            up as nations and slaughtered one another by thousands to settle a dispute about a geographical boundary. Such a procedure will
                            appear to have been quite as barbarous as the cannibalistic practices of their yet more remote ancestors, and distinctly less
                            rational, since cannibalism might sometimes save its practiser from starvation, whereas warfare of the civilized type was a purely
                            destructive agency.</p>
                        <p>Equally obvious must it appear to the cosmopolite of some generation of the future that quality rather than mere numbers must
                            determine the efficiency of any given community. Race suicide will then cease to be a bugbear; and it will no longer be considered
                            rational to keep up the census at the cost of propagating low orders of intelligence, to feed the ranks of paupers, defectives and
                            criminals. On the contrary it will be thought fitting that man should become the conscious arbiter of his own racial destiny to the
                            extent of applying whatever laws of heredity he knows or may acquire in the interests of his own species, as he has long applied
                            them in the case of domesticated animals. The survival and procreation of the unfit will then cease to be a menace to the progress
                            of civilization. It does not follow that <pb n="409" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0409.png"/> all men will be brought to a dead level of equality of body and mind, nor
                            that individual competition will cease ; but the average physical mental status of the race will be raised immeasurably through the
                            virtual elimination of that vast company of defectives which to-day constitutes so threatening an obstacle to racial progress. There
                            are millions of men in Europe and America to-day whose whole mental equipment—despite the fact that they have been taught to read
                            and write—is far more closely akin to the average of the Upper Period of Barbarism than to the highest standards of their own time ;
                            and these undeveloped or atavistic persons have on the average more offspring than are produced by the more highly cultured and
                            intelligent among their contemporaries. <q>" Race suicide "</q> is thereby prevented, but the progress of civilization is no less
                            surely handicapped. We may well believe that the cosmopolite of the future, aided by science, will find rational means to remedy
                            this strange illogicality. In so doing he will exercise a more consciously purposeful function, and perhaps a more directly potent
                            influence, in determining the line of human progress than he has hitherto attempted to assume, notwithstanding the almost infinitely
                            varied character of the experiments through which he has worked his way from savagery to civilization.</p>

                        <p>All these considerations tend to define yet more clearly the ultimate goal towards which the progressive civilization of past and
                            present appears to be trending. The contemplation of this goal brings into view the outlines of a vastly suggestive evolutionary
                            cycle. For it appears that the social condition of cosmopolite man, so far as the present-day view can predict it, will represent a
                            state of things, magnified to world-dimensions, that was curiously adumbrated by the social system of the earliest savage. At the
                            very beginning of the journey through savagery, mankind, we may well believe, consisted of a limited tribe, representing no great
                            range or variety of capacity, and an almost absolute identity of interests. Thanks to this community of interests,—which was
                            fortified by the recognition of blood-relationship among all members of the tribe, principle which we now define as <q>" the
                                greatest ultimate good to the greatest number "</q> found practical, even if unwitting, recognition ; and therein lay the germs
                            of all the moral development of the future. But obvious identity of interests could be recognized only so long as the tribe remained
                            very small. So soon as its numbers became large, patent diversities of interest, based on individual selfishness, must appear, to
                            obscure the larger harmony. And as savage man migrated hither and thither, occupying new regions and thus developing new tribes and
                            ultimately a diversity of <q>"races,"</q> all idea of community of interests, as between race and race, must have been absolutely
                            banished. It was the obvious and patent fact that each race was more or less at rivalry, in disharmony, with all the others. In the
                            hard struggle for subsistence, the expansion of one race meant the downfall of another. So far as any principle of <q>" greatest
                                good "</q> remained in evidence, it applied solely to the members of one's own community, or even to one's particular phratry or
                            gens.</p>
                        <p>Barbaric man, thanks to his conquest of animal and vegetable nature was able to extend the size of the unified community, and hence
                            to develop through diverse and intricate channels the application of the principle of <q>" greatest good "</q> out of which the idea
                            of right and wrong was elaborated. But quite as little as the savage did he think of extending the application of the principle
                            beyond the bounds of his own race. The laws with which he gave expression to his ethical conceptions applied, of necessity, to his
                            own people alone. The gods with which his imagination peopled the world were local in habitat, devoted to the interests of his race
                            only, and at enmity with the gods of rival peoples. As between nation and nation, the only principle of ethics that ever occurred to
                            him was that might makes right. Civilized man for a long time advanced but slowly upon this view of international morality. No
                            Egyptian or Babylonian or Hebrew or Greek or Roman ever hesitated to attack a weaker nation on the ground that it would be wrong to
                            do so. And few indeed are the instances in which even a modern nation has judged an international question on any other basis than
                            that of self-interest. It was not till towards the close of the 19th century that an International Peace Conference gave tangible
                            witness that the idea of fellowship of nations was finding recognition; and in the same recent period history has recorded the first
                            instance of a powerful nation vanquishing a weaker one without attempting to exact at least an <q>" indemnifying "</q> tribute.</p>
                        <p>But the citizen of the future, if the auguries of the present prove true, will be able to apply principles of right and wrong without
                            reference to national boundaries. He will understand that the interests of the entire human family are, in the last analysis, common
                            interests. The census through which he attempts to estimate <q>" the greatest good of the greatest number "</q> must include, not
                            his own nation merely, but the remotest member of the human race. On this universal basis must be founded that absolute standard of
                            ethics which will determine the relations of cosmopolite man with his fellows. When this ideal is attained, mankind will again
                            represent a single family, as it did in the day when our primeval ancestors first entered on the pathway of progress ; but it will
                            be a family whose habitat has been extended from the narrow glade of some tropical forest to the utmost habitable confines of the
                            globe. Each member of this family will be permitted to enjoy the greatest amount of liberty consistent with the like liberty of
                            every other member ; but the interests of the few will everywhere be recognized as subservient to the interests of the many, and
                            such recognition of mutual interests will establish the practical criterion for the interpretation of international affairs.</p>

                        <p>But such an extension of the altruistic principle by no means presupposes the elimination of egoistic impulses—of individualism. On
                            the contrary, we must suppose that man at the highest stages of culture will be, even as was the savage, a seeker after the greatest
                            attainable degree of comfort for the least necessary expenditure of energy. The pursuit of this ideal has been from first to last
                            the ultimate impelling force in nature urging man forward. The only change has been a change in the interpretation of the ideal, an
                            altered estimate as to what manner of things are mostworth the purchaseprice of toil and self-denial. That the things most worth the
                            having cannot, generally speaking, be secured without such toil and self-denial, is a lesson that began to be inculcated while man
                            was a savage, and that has never ceased to be reiterated generation after generation. It is the final test of progressive
                            civilization that a given effort shall produce a larger and larger modicum of average individual comfort. That is why the great
                            inventions that have increased man's efficiency as a worker have been the necessarv prerequisites to racial progress. Stated
                            otherwise, that is why the industrial factor is everywhere the most powerful factor in civilization ; and why the economic
                            interpretation is the most searching interpretation of history at its every stage. It is the basal fact that progress implies
                            increased average working efficiency—a growing ratio between average effort and average achievement—that gives sure warrant for such
                            a prognostication as has just been attempted concerning the future industrial unification of our race. The efforts of civilized man
                            provide him, on the average, with a marvellous range of comforts, as contrasted with those that rewarded the most strenuous efforts
                            of savage or barbarian, to whom present-day necessaries would have been undreamed-of luxuries. But the ideal ratio between effort
                            and result has by no means been achieved; nor will it have been until the inventive brain of man has provided a civilization in
                            which a far higher percentage of citizens will find the life-vocations to which they are best adapted by nature, and in which,
                            therefore, the efforts of the average worker may be directed with such vigour, enthusiasm and interest as can alone make for true
                            efficiency ; a civilization adjusted to such an economic balance that the average man may live in reasonable comfort without
                            heart-breaking strain, and yet accumulate a sufficient surplus to ensure ease and serenity for his declining days. Such, seemingly,
                            should be the normal goal of progressive civilization. Doubtless mankind in advancing towards that goal will institute many changes
                            that could by no possibility be <pb n="410" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.06.0410.png"/> foretold; but (to summarize the views just presented) it seems a safe augury from

                        from such descriptive limitation to the limitation of occupation by particular owners or races is easy; this gives the common use of the

                        <p>In the following treatment of this subject, the theory and early history of education is first dealt with, and secondly the modern
                            organization of education as a national concern. Many definitions have been given of the word <q>"education,"</q> but underlying
                            them all is the conception that it denotes an attempt on the part of the adult members of a human society to shape the development
                            of the coming generation in accordance with its own ideals of life. It is true that the word has not infrequently been used in wider
                            senses than this. For example, <ref>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name> included
                                under it everything which <quote>"helps to shape the human being"</quote>
                            </ref>; and, with some poetic licence, we speak of the
                            education of a people or even of the whole human race. But all such usages are rhetorical extensions of the commonly accepted sense
                            of the term, which includes, as an essential element, the idea of deliberate direction and training (Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">educare</hi>
                            </foreign>, to bring up; <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">educere</hi>
                            </foreign>, to draw
                            out, lead forth). No doubt, all education is effected through the experiences of the educated, and much of it is indirect,
                            consisting mainly in the determination of the form of experiences other than those of direct precept, compulsion and instruction.
                            But it does not follow that all experiences are educative. Whether an experience is part of an individual's education or not is
                            determined by its origin. Whatever be its effect, it is educative in so far as its form has been arranged with greater or less
                            deliberation by those who are concerned with the training of him whose experience it is. It follows that an education may be good or
                            bad, and that its goodness or badness will be relative to the virtue, wisdom and intelligence of the educator. It is good only when
                            it aims at the right kind of product, and when the means it adopts are well adapted to secure the intended result and are applied
                            intelligently, consistently and persistently.</p>
                        <p>Education is, thus, a definitely personal work, and will vary between wide extremes of effectiveness and worth in any given society.
                            For in all times and places there are wide differences in virtue, wisdom and capacity among those who have in their hands the care
                            and nurture of the young. But the inference that, therefore, no comparative estimate of the education of different times and places
                            can be made would be fallacious. For, despite all differences in conception and efficiency among individual educators, each
                            expresses, more or less perfectly and clearly, the common conception and energy of his age and country. As these rise or fall the
                            general level of the actual educative practice rises or sinks with them. The first essential for successful educative effort is,
                            then, that the community as a whole should have a true estimate of the nature and value of education.</p>

                            <p>In any comparative estimate of different places and times, as tested by the standard just given, it must be borne in mind that,
                                except in the most general and abstract form, we cannot speak of an ideally best education. Looking at the individual to be
                                educated, we may say with <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> that the aim of
                                    education is <quote>"to develop in the body and in the soul all the beauty and all the perfection of which they are
                                        capable,"</quote>
                                </ref> but this leaves quite undecided the nature and form of that beauty and perfection, and on such
                                points there has never been universal agreement at any one time, while successive ages have shown marked differences of
                                estimate. We get nearer to the point when we reflect that individual beauty and perfection are shown, and only shown, in actual
                                life, and that such life has to be lived under definite conditions of time, place, culture, religion, national aspirations and
                                mastery over material conditions. Perfection of life, then, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">the
                                    Athens</name> of the age of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> would show a very
                                different form from that which it would take in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> or
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> of to-day. So an individualistic statement of the
                                purpose of education leads on analysis to considerations that are not, in themselves, individualistic. The personal life is
                                throughout a relation between individual promptings to activity and the environment in which alone such promptings can, by being
                                actualized, become part of life. And the perfection of the life is to be sought in the perfection of the relations thus
                                established. So far, then, as any conception of education can give guidance to the actual process it must be relative in every
                                way to the state of development of the society in which it is given. Indeed, looked at in the mass, education may be said to be
                                the efforts made by the community to impose its culture upon the growing generation. Here again is room for difference. The
                                culture in question may be accepted as absolute at least in its essentials, and then the ideal of education will be to secure
                                its stability and perpetuation, or it may be regarded as a stage in a process of development, and then the ideal will be to
                                facilitate the advance of the next generation beyond the point reached by the present. So some ages will show a relatively fixed
                                conception of the educative process, others will be times of unrest and change in this as in other modes of social and
                                intellectual life.</p>
                            <p>It is in these latter times that the actual work of education is apt to lose touch with the culture of the community. For schools
                                (q.v.) and universities (q.v.), which are the ordinary channels through which adult culture reaches the young, are naturally
                                conservative and bound by tradition. They are slow to leave the old paths which have hitherto led to the desired goal, and to
                                enter on new and untried ways. If the opposition to change is absolute, there must come a time when the instruments of education
                                are out of true relation to the desired end. For change in culture ideals means change in the specific form of the goal of
                                education, and consequently the paths of educative effort need readjustment. When the goal of the past is no longer the goal of
                                the present, to follow the ways which led to <pb n="952" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0952.png"/> the former is to fail to reach the latter. Continuous readjustment,
                                by small and almost imperceptible degrees, is the ideal at which the educator should aim. When this is not secured, the
                                educational domain is liable to sudden and violent revolutions which are destructive of successful educative effort at the time
                                they occur, however beneficial their results may be in the future.</p>
                            <p>But the relation of adjustment is not entirely one-sided. The tone of thought and feeling and the direction of will induced by
                                education necessarily affect, the common ideals of the next generation, and may make them better or worse than those of the
                                present. Hence, the educator must not blindly accept all current views of life, but rather select the highest. For the average
                                thought of every community is obviously below its best thought; and may, in some points at any rate, be lower than the best
                                thought of a past age. While, then, all true education must be in direct relation with the culture of its age and country, yet,
                                especially on the ethical side, it should aim at transcending the average thought and tone.</p>
                            <p>Still more does this imply that education strives to transcend the present condition of the educated by making their life more
                                rational, more volitional, and more attracted by goodness and beauty than it would otherwise be. It can never be a passive
                                watching of the child's development. No more fundamental error can be made than the assumption that education can be determined
                                wholly, or even mainly, by the tendencies and impulses with which a child is endowed. Its real guiding principle must be a
                                conception of the nature to which the child may attain, not a knowledge of that with which it starts. The educator studies the
                                original endowment of the child and the early stages in the development of that innate nature in order that he may, wisely and
                                successfully, employ appropriate means to direct further development and to accelerate its progress towards a more rational,
                                complete and worthy life; not that he may the more skilfully give facilities to the child to drift about on the unregulated
                                currents of caprice.</p>
                            <p>Such considerations show the importance of an insight into the theory of education on the part of all who are practically
                                concerned with its direction. But the theory required is no system of abstract ideas ignoring the real concrete conditions of
                                the life for which the actual education it is to guide is a preparation. To approach the subject only from the standpoint of the
                                mental sciences which underlie it is to run the risk of setting up such a body of abstractions, whose relation to real life is
                                neither very close nor very direct. The most profitable way of developing an educational theory for the present is to trace how
                                in the past education has consciously adapted itself, more or less truly and fully, to the conditions of culture and social
                                life; and by analysis to discover the reasons for comparative success or failure in the degree of clearness with which the end
                                to be sought was apprehended and the nature of the children to be trained was understood.</p>
                            <p>In all ages the claims of the individual and those of the community have struggled for the mastery as the ultimate principles of
                                life. As one or the other has prevailed the conception of education has emphasized social service or individual success as the
                                primary end. The true harmony of human life will only be attained when these two impulses, contradictory on their own level, are
                                united in a higher synthesis which sees each as the complement of the other in a life whose purpose is neither simple egoism nor
                                pure altruism. Until that conception of life is attained and held generally there can be no sure and universally accepted
                                conception of the aim and function of education. Much of the interest of the history of education <note>For the evolution of the

                            <p>In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">ancient Greece</name> the supremacy of the state was
                                generally unquestioned, and, especially in the earlier times, the good man was identified with the good citizen. No doubt, in
                                later days phflosophers, such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, saw clearly that the round of the duties of
                                citizenship did not exhaust the life of the individual. With them the highest life was one of cultured leisure in which the
                                energies were mainly concentrated on the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. But this <q>"diagogic"</q> life was only for the
                                select few; for the undistinguished many the fulfilment by each of the duties of his station remained the measure of worthy
                                life, though such duties were regarded as affecting the individual and private relations of the citizens in a much more intimate
                                way than in former and ruder ages. And for those who devoted their lives to the highest culture, the essential preliminary
                                condition was the existence of such a state as would form the most favourable environment for their pursuits and the most stable
                                foundation for their leisured life. Thus Greek thought was saturated with the conception of life as essentially a set of
                                relations between the individual and the city-state of which he formed an integral part. The first aim of education was
                                therefore to train the young as citizens.</p>
                            <p>This training must, of necessity, be of a specific kind; for, like other small communities, the Greek city-states showed a life
                                fundamentally one in conception, under various specific forms. Each state had its special character, and to this character the
                                education given in it must conform if it were to be an effective instrument for training the citizens. From these fundamental
                                conceptions flowed the demands of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> that education should be regulated in all its
                                details by the state authority, should be compulsory on all free citizens, and should be uniform—at any rate in its earlier
                                stages—for all. In <bibl>

                                shows to what extreme lengths theory may go when it neglects to take account of some of the most pertinent facts of life. For
                                the guardian-citizens of the ideal state family life and family ties are abolished; no lower community is to be allowed to enter
                                into competition with the state. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, indeed, did
                                not go to these extreme lengths; he allowed the family to remain, but he seems to have regarded it as likely to affect children
                                more for evil than for good.</p>
                            <p>In the essential principles laid down by both philosophers as to the relation of the state to education, and in the corollaries
                                they drew from that relation, they were not at variance with the accepted Greek theory on the subject. It is true that the
                                actual practice of Greek states departed,-and often widely, from this ideal, for, especially in later centuries, the Greek
                                always tended to live his own life. The nearest approach to the theory was found in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta">Sparta</name>, where the end of the state as a military organization was kept
                                steadily in view, and where, after early childhood, the young citizens were trained directly by the state in a kind of barrack
                                life—the boys to become warriors, the girls the mothers of warriors. It was this feature of Spartan education, together with the
                                rude simplicity of life it enforced, which attracted <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name>,
                                and, to a less extent, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> there had of old been state laws insisting on the attendance of the

                                concerned itself only with the training of the ephebi, for which, we learn from <bibl>

                                both intellectual and physical pursuits. For children and youths under the ephebic age there was no practical regulation of
                                schools or palaestra by the state. Yet there is no doubt that the education really given was in conformity with Athenian ideals
                                of culture and life, and that it was generally received by the children of free citizens, though of course the sons of the
                                wealthy, then as now, could and did continue their attendance at school to a later age than their poorer brethren. The education

                                systematic regulation, regarded as the greatest defect of Athenian education was in reality its strongest point. In practice,
                                the harmony between individual liberty and social claims was much more nearly attained under a system of free working out of
                                common thoughts and ideals than would have been the case under one of the irresistible imposition from without of a rigid

                                Athenian culture advanced, increasing attention was paid to diagogic studies, especially in the ephebic age, with a
                                corresponding decrease of attention to merely physical pursuits; hence the complaints of such satirists as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</name> of a growing luxury, effeminacy and corruption of youths:
                                complaints apparently based on a comparison of the worst features of the actual present with an idealized and imaginative
                                picture of the virtues of the past. Such comparison is, indeed, implicit in much of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> as well as in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</name>.</p>
                            <p>But a disintegrating force was already at work in the educational system of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> vainly opposed. This was the rhetorical training of the Sophists, the narrowly practical and
                                individualistic aim of which was entirely out of harmony with the older Greek ideals of life and culture. In a democratic
                                city-state the orator easily became a demagogue, and generally oratory was the readiest path to influence and power. Thus
                                oratory opened the way to personal ambition, and young men who were moved by that passion eagerly attended the Sophist schools
                                where their dominant motive was strengthened.</p>
                            <p>Further, the closer relations between the Greek states, both in nearer and farther <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Hellas</name>, led naturally to the diminution of differences between civic
                                ideals, and, as a consequence, to a more cosmopolitan conception of higher education. This process was completed by the loss of
                                political independence of the city-states under the Macedonian domination. Henceforth, higher education became purely
                                intellectual, and its relation to political and social life increasingly remote. This, combined with the growing rhetorical
                                tendency already noticed, accounts for the sterility of Greek thought during the succeeding centuries. The means of higher
                                education were, indeed, more fully organized. The university of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> was the outcome of a fusion of the private philosophical schools with the state organization for the training
                                of the ephebi, and there were other such centres of higher culture, especially in after years at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, where the contact of Greek thought with the religions and
                                philosophies of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name> and the East gave birth in time
                                to the more or less mystical philosophies which culminated in Neo-platonism. But at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> itself thought became more and more sterile, and education more and
                                more a mere training in unreal rhetoric, till the dissolution of the university by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justinian_I">Justinian</name> in A.D. 529.</p>

                            <p>Thus when <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Republic">Rome</name> conquered <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, Greek education had lost that reality which is drawn from
                                intimate relation to civic life, and the fashionable individualistic schools of philosophy could do nothing to replace the loss.
                                It was, then, an education which had largely lost its life-springs that was transferred to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>. In the earlier centuries of the republic, Roman education was
                                given entirely in family and public life. The father had unlimited power over his son's life, and was open to public censure if
                                he failed to train him in the ordinary moral, civic and religious duties. But it is doubtful if there were any schools (q.v.),
                                and it is certain there was no national literature to furnish an instrument of culture. A Roman boy learnt to reverence the
                                gods, to read, to bear himself well in manly exercises, and to know enough of the laws of his country to regulate his conduct.
                                This last he acquired directly by hearing his father decide the cases of his clients every morning in his hall. The rules of
                                courtesy he learnt similarly by accompanying his father to the social gatherings to which he was invited. Thus early Roman
                                education was essentially practical, civic and moral, but its intellectual outlook was extremely narrow.</p>

                            <p>When a wider culture was imported from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> it was,
                                however, the form rather than the spirit of true Hellenic education that was transferred. This was, indeed, to some extent
                                inevitable from the decadent state of Greek education at the time, but it was accentuated by the essentially practical character
                                of the Roman mind. The instrument of education first introduced was Greek literature, much of which was soon translated into
                                Latin. In time the schools of the <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">grammatici</hi>
                                </foreign>, teaching grammar and
                                literature, were supplemented by schools of rhetoric and philosophy, though the philosophy taught in them was itself little more
                                than rhetorical declamation. These furnished the means of higher culture for those youths who did not study at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name> or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name>, and were also preparatory to studies at those universities. Under
                                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> the rhetorical schools were
                                gradually organized into a state system, the general principles of administration being laid down by imperial decree, and even
                                such details as the appointment and rate of payment of the professors, at first left to the municipalities, being in time
                                assumed by the central government. There is no evidence of any state regulation or support of the lower schools. This widening
                                of culture affected both boys and girls, the domestic education of the latter being supplemented by a study of literature. But
                                it is the higher training in rhetoric which is especially characteristic of Hellenized Roman education.</p>

                                </bibl>, the most systematic treatise on education produced by the ancient world. With <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> the ideal of an orator was a widely cultured,
                                wise and honourable man. And at first the teaching of rhetoric undoubtedly made for higher and true culture. But with the
                                autocracy, soon passing into tyranny, of the empire, rhetoric ceased to be a preparation for real life. The true function of
                                oratory is to persuade a free people. When it cannot be applied to this purpose it becomes little more than a means of
                                intellectual frivolity, or, at the best, an exhibition of cultured ingenuity. Under the empire a rhetorical training was,
                                indeed, turned in not a few instances to practical but most unworthy uses by the delators ; a result made possible by the legal
                                system which rewarded delation with a considerable portion of the estate of the condemned. Even apart from this, the education
                                in rhetoric had an increasingly evil effect both on the culture and on the character of the higher classes in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman empire</name>. Out of real connexion with life
                                as it was, it sought its subjects in the realms of the fanciful and the trivial, and with unreality of topic went of necessity
                                deterioration of style. The vivid presentment of living thought gave way to that inflated and bombastic abuse of meretricious
                                ornament and far-fetched metaphor in which human speech is always involved when it sets forth ideas, or shadows of ideas, which
                                grow out of no conviction in the speaker and are expected to carry no conviction to the hearer. Imitation of the form of great
                                models, without the substance of thought which underlay them, led to a general unreality and essential falseness of mental life.
                                Further, the continual gazing with admiration on the productions of the past, and the conception of excellence as consisting in
                                closeness of imitation, induced a servile attitude of mind towards authority in all too close agreement with the political
                                servility which marked the Roman court. Such an attitude was essentially hostile to mental initiative, and thus rhetoric became
                                not merely an art of expression but a type of character.</p>
                            <p>Nor was there anything in the general conditions of society to counterbalance the ill effects of school and university education.
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> lamented that, even in his time, the old
                                Roman family education by example was corrupted; and the moral degradation of later times, though it has doubtless been
                                exaggerated, was certainly real and widespread. Nor does the <pb n="954" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0954.png"/> religious revival of Paganism which synchronized with
                                the early centuries of Christianity appear to have effected any reform in life. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, the birthplace of Neo-platonism and the intellectual centre

                            <p>It was into such a decaying civilization, which by its want of vitality sterilized education, oppressing it under the weight of a
                                dead tradition, that Christianity brought new life. Of course, careful instruction in the Faith was given in catechetical
                                schools, of which that at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name> was the most famous.
                                But the question as to the attitude of Christians towards the ordinary classical culture was important. On the one hand,
                                literature was saturated with Paganism, and the Pagan festivals formed a regular part of school life. On the other hand, the
                                Pagan education offered the only means of higher culture, and thus furnished the only weapon with which Christians could
                                successfully meet their controversial antagonists. Quite at first, no doubt, when the converts to the new faith were few and
                                obscure, the question scarcely arose; but as men of culture and position were attracted to the Church it became urgent. The
                                answers given by the Christian leaders were various, and largely the outcome of temperament and previous training. The Greek
                                Fathers, especially <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clement_of_Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</name>
                                (150-217) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Origen">Origen</name> (185-253), regarded Christianity as
                                essentially the culmination of philosophy, to which the way must be found through liberal culture. Without a liberal education
                                the Christian could live a life of faith and obedience but could not attain an intellectual understanding of the mysteries of
                                the Faith. On the other hand, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian">Tertullian</name> (160-240) was
                                very suspicious of Pagan culture; though he granted the necessity of employing it as a means of education, yet he did so with
                                regret, and would forbid Christians to teach it in the public schools, where some recognition of Paganism would be implied. The
                                general practice of the Christians, however, did not conform to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian">Tertullian</name>'s exhortations. Indeed, many of the cultivated Christians of the 3rd and 4th centuries were little more
                                than nominal adherents to the Faith, and the intercourse between Christian and Pagan was often close and friendly. The general
                                attitude of Christians towards the traditional education is evidenced by the protest raised against the edict of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_the_Apostate">Julian</name>, which forbade them to teach in the public
                                schools. The ultimate outcome seems to be fairly expressed in the writings of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">St Augustine</name> (354-430) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome">St Jerome</name> (346-420), who held that literary and rhetorical culture is good
                                so long as it is kept subservient to the Christian life.</p>
                            <p>In another way Greek philosophy exercised an abiding influence over the culture of future ages. The early centuries of
                                Christianity felt the need of formulating the Faith to preserve it from disintegration into a mass of fluid opinions, and such
                                formulation was of necessity made under the influence of the philosophy in which the early Fathers had been trained—that
                                Neo-platonism which was the last effort of Paganism to attain a conception of life and of God. In the West, this formulation had
                                to be translated into Latin, for Greek was no longer generally understood in Italy, and thus the juristic trend of Roman thought
                                also became a factor in the exposition of Christian doctrine. This formulation of the Faith was one of the chief legacies the
                                transition centuries passed on to <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>.</p>
                            <p>Had classical culture been less formal than it was during the early centuries of Christianity, the innate antagonism of the Pagan
                                and Christian views of life and character must have been so apparent that the education which prepared for the one could not
                                have been accepted by the other. It was only because rhetorical culture was so emphatically intellectual, and so little, if at
                                all, moral in its aims, that its inherent opposition to the Christian conception of character was not obvious. That its
                                antagonistic influence was not inoperative is shown by the not infrequent perversions of cultured Christians to Paganism. But
                                generally the opposition was so obscured that the ethical writings of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ambrose">St Ambrose</name> (340-397) are largely Stoic in conception and reasoning. Yet the
                                Pagan ideal of life, especially as it had been developed in the individualistic ethics which had prevailed for more than six
                                centuries, was antithetical in essence to that of the Christian Church. The former was essentially an ethics of self-reliance
                                and self-control showing itself in moderation and proportion in all expressions of life. An essential feature in such a
                                character was high-mindedness and a self-respect which was of the nature of pride. On the contrary, Christian teaching exalted
                                humility as one of the highest virtues, and regarded pride and self-confidence as the deadliest of sins. It recognized no
                                doctrine of limitation; what was to be condemned could not be abhorred too violently, nor could what was good be too strongly
                                desired or too ardently sought. The highest state attainable by man was absorption in loving ecstasy in the mystic contemplation
                                of God. The practical attempt to realize this gave rise to monasticism, with its minutely regulated life expressing unlimited
                                obedience and the renunciation of private will at every moment. The monastic life was regarded as the nearest approach to the
                                ideal which a Christian could make on earth. Naturally, as this conception gathered strength in generations nurtured in it, the
                                value of classical culture became less and less apparent, and by the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_I">St Gregory the Great</name> (d. 604) the use of classical literature except
                                as means of an education having quite another end than classical culture was discouraged.</p>

                                operative in the obscuring of culture. Most of the public schools disappeared, and generally the light of learning was kept
                                burning only in monasteries, and in them more and more faintly as they became more or less isolated units exposed to attack by
                                ruthless foes or living in continual dread of such attack. Though the barbarians absorbed the old culture in various degrees of

                            <p>During these same centuries another process had been advancing with accelerating steps. This was the modification of the Latin
                                language. In the early centuries of Christianity literary Latin was already very different from colloquial Latin, especially in
                                the provinces; and, as has been said, the literary output of the last age of Paganism was marked by sterility of thought and
                                meretricious redundancy of expression. On the other hand, the writings of Christianity show a real living force seeking to find
                                appropriate expression in new forms. Thus, with Christian writers, slavish imitation of the past gradually gave way to the
                                evolution of a new and living Latin, which showed itself more and more regardless of classical models. To express the new ideas
                                to which Christianity gave birth fresh words were coined, or borrowed from colloquial speech or from the Hebrew and Greek
                                Scriptures. This Christian Latin was a real living instrument of expression, which conformed itself in its structure much more
                                closely to the mode of thought and expression of actual life than did the artificial imitation of antiquity in which the
                                literary productions of Paganism were clothed. It is the Latin in which <bibl>

                                barbarian invasions this current Latin became more and more oblivious of even such elements of form as grammatical inflexions
                                and concords.</p>

                                    Carolingian revival</name> addressed itself. The movement was essentially practical and conservative. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcuin">Alcuin</name> (735-804), who was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>'s educational adviser and chief executive officer in
                                scholastic matters, was probably the best scholar of his time, and himself loved the classical writings with which he was
                                acquainted , but the text-books he wrote were but imperfect summaries of existing compendia, and the intellectual condition of
                                his pupils forbade a very generous literary diet even had he thought it desirable, of which there is some doubt. The most
                                valuable outcome of the movement was the establishment <pb n="955" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0955.png"/> of the palace school, and of bishops' schools and monastic
                                schools throughout the empire. Of these the latter were the most important, and each of the chief monasteries had from the time
                                of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name> an external school for pupils not
                                proposing to enter the order as well as an internal school for novices. Thus, the educational system north of the Alps was
                                pre-eminently ecclesiastical in its organization and profoundly religious in its aims. For two centuries the new intellectual
                                life was obscured by the troubled times which followed the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>, but the learning which <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carolingian_Renaissance">the Carolingian revival</name> had restored was preserved here and
                                there in cathedral and monastic schools, and the sequence of well-educated ecclesiastics was never altogether interrupted.</p>

                            <p>The scope of the arts was wider than their names would suggest in modern times. Under grammar was included the study of the
                                content and form of literature; and in practice the teaching varied from a liberal literary culture to a dry and perfunctory
                                study of just enough grammar to give some facility in the use of Latin. Dialectic was mainly formal logic. Rhetoric covered the
                                study of law, as well as composition in prose and verse. Geometry was rather what is now understood by geography and natural
                                history, together with the medicinal properties of plants. Arithmetic, with the cumbrous Roman notation, included little more
                                than the simplest practical calculations required in ordinary life and the computation of the calendar. Music embraced the rules
                                of the plain-song of the Church, some theory of sound, and the connexion of harmony and numbers. Astronomy dealt with the
                                courses of the heavenly bodies, and was seldom kept free from astrology. In philosophy the current text-books were <bibl>the

                                known that it was found possible to bring the Peripatetic philosophy into the service of theology.</p>
                            <p>There were thus two broad stages in the educational revival commonly known as scholasticism. In the first the controversies were
                                essentially metaphysical, and centred round the question of the nature of universals; the orthodox theological party generally
                                supporting realism, or the doctrine that the universal is the true reality, of which particulars and individuals are only
                                appearances ; while the opposite doctrine of nominalism—that universals are <q>" mere sounds "</q> and particulars the only true
                                existences—showed a continual disposition to lapse into heresies on the most fundamental doctrines of the Church. The second
                                stage was essentially constructive; the opposition of philosophy to theology was negated, and philosophy gave a systematic form
                                to theology itself. The most characteristic figure of the former period was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Abelard">Abelard</name> (1079-1142), of the latter <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St Thomas Aquinas</name> (1225-1274). The former knew little of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> beyond the translations and adaptations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anicius_Manlius_Severinus_Boethius">Boethius</name>, but he was essentially a
                                dialectician who applied his logic to investigating the fundamental doctrines of the Church and bringing everything to the bar
                                of reason. This innate rationalism appeared to bring theology under the sway of philosophy, and led to frequent condemnations of
                                his doctrines as heretical. With <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St Thomas</name>, on the
                                other hand, the essential dogmas of Christianity must be unquestioned. In his <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Summa_Theologica">

                            <p>It is evident, then, that during the period of the scholastic revival, men's interests were specially occupied with questions
                                concerning the spiritual and the unseen, and that the great instrument of thought was syllogistic logic, by which consequences
                                were deduced from premises received as unquestionably true. There was a general acceptance of the authority of the Church in
                                matters of belief and conduct, and of that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>,

                                barrenness of a training confined to the subtleties of formal logic. But the recrudescence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> accelerated the movement in favour of dialectic, though at the
                                same time it furnished topics on which logic could be exercised which only a bare materialism can esteem unimportant. The
                                weaknesses of the general educational system which grew up within scholasticism were that haste to begin dialectic led to an
                                undue curtailment of previous liberal culture, and that exclusive attention to philosophical and theological questions caused a
                                neglect of the study of the physical world and a disregard of the critical functions of the intellect. Doubtless there were
                                exceptions, of which perhaps the most striking is the work in physical science done at Oxford by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name> (1214-1294). But <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albertus_Magnus">Albertus Magnus</name> (1193-1280), the master of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St Thomas</name>, was also a student of nature and an authority for his day
                                on both the natural and the physical sciences. And the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Grosseteste">Grosseteste</name> (d. 1253), as chancellor of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">the university of Oxford</name>, shows that care for a liberal
                                literary <pb n="956" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0956.png"/> culture was by no means unknown. Always there were such examples. But too often boys hastened to enter
                                upon dialectic and philosophy as soon as they had acquired sufficient smattering of colloquial Latin to engage in the disputes
                                of the schools. A deterioration of Latin was the unavoidable consequence of such premature specialization. The seven liberal
                                arts were often not pursued in their entirety, and students remained satisfied with desiccated compendia of accepted opinions.

                            <p>The services of scholasticism to the cause of education, however, cannot well be overestimated, and the content of scholastic
                                studies was in fundamental harmony with the intellectual interests of the time. Above all other benefits owed by future ages to
                                scholasticism is the foundation of the universities of western Europe. The intellectual activity of the 11th century led
                                everywhere to a great increase in the number of scholars attending the monastic and cathedral schools. Round famous teachers,
                                such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Abelard">Abelard</name>, gathered crowds of students from
                                every country. In the 12th century the need for organizing such bodies of teachers and students was imperative, and thus the
                                earlier universities arose in Italy, France and England, not by deliberate foundation of secular or ecclesiastical ruler, but as
                                spontaneous manifestations of the characteristic medieval impulse to organize into institutions. Afterwards, charters conferring
                                powers and privileges were sought from both Church and state, but these only confirmed the selfgoverning character the
                                universities had borne from the first. Each of the early universities was a specialized school of higher study: <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Salerno">Salerno</name> was a school of medicine; <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Bologna">Bologna</name> was the centre of that revival of Roman
                                law which wrought so profound an effect upon the legal systems of France and Germany towards the close of the medieval period.
                                But the greatest of medieval universities was that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>,
                                emphatically the home of philosophy and theology, which was the model upon which many other universities, including <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>, were organized.</p>
                            <p>The German universities were of later origin, the earliest being <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_University_in_Prague">Prague</name> (1348) and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Vienna">Vienna</name> (1365). They indicate the more recognized position the
                                movement had attained ; for nearly all were founded by the civic authority, and then obtained the recognition of the Church and
                                charters from the emperor.</p>

                            <p>The concentration of higher instruction in universities was not antagonistic to the medieval conception of the Church as the
                                teacher of mankind. University life was modelled on that of the closter, though the monastic ideal could not be fully realized,
                                and the scholars not infrequently exhibited considerable licence in life. This was inevitable with the very large numbers of the
                                scholars and the great variations of age among them. Moreover students, and to a less extent teachers, passed from university to
                                university, so that the universities of medieval Europe formed a free confederacy of learning in close relation to the Church
                                but untrammelled by state control. Nevertheless, they were less definitely ecclesiastical than the cathedral seminaries which
                                they largely supplanted, and the introduction of studies derived from <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> through <name type="people">the Arabians</name> led to an
                                increased freedom of thought, at first within authorized limits, but prepared, when occasion served, to transcend those
                                limits.</p>
                            <p>The scheme of instruction was arranged on the assumption that special studies should be based on a wide general culture. Thus of
                                the four faculties into which university teaching was organized, that of arts, with its degrees of Baccalaureat and Magister,
                                was regarded as propaedeutic to those of theology, law and medicine. It often included, indeed, quite young boys, for the
                                distinction between grammar school and university was not clearly drawn. Attention was concentrated on those subjects which
                                treat of man and his relations to his fellow-men and to God, and no attempt was made to extend the bounds of knowledge. The aim
                                was to pass on a body of acquired knowledge regarded as embracing all that was possible of attainment, and the authority of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> in physics as well as in philosophy, and of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galen">Galen</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</name> in medicine was absolute. The methods of instruction—by
                                lecture, or commentary on received texts; and by disputation, in which the scholars acquired dexterity in the use of the
                                knowledge they had absorbed—were in harmony with this conception, and were undoubtedly thoroughly well suited to the
                                requirements of an age in which the ideal of human thought was not discovery but order, and in which knowledge was regarded as a
                                set of established propositions, the work of reason being to harmonize these propositions in subordination to the authoritative
                                doctrines of the Church.</p>

                            <p>Such an extension of the means of higher education as was given by the universities was naturally accompanied by a corresponding
                                increase in schools of lower rank. Not only were there grammar schools at cathedral and collegiate churches, but many others
                                were founded in connexion with chantries, and by some of the many gilds into which medieval middle-class life organized itself.
                                The Dominican and Franciscan friars were enthusiastic promoters of learning both in universities and in schools, and in the

                                one of their main functions, and the promotion of learning by the multiplication of manuscripts as another. The curriculum was

                                grammar, which included very various amounts of reading of classical and Christian authors, the most commonly included being

                                learned to read, write and keep accounts, as well as fine needlework, household duties and management, and such elementary
                                surgery and medicine as served in cases of slight daily accidents and illnesses. Even those boys and girls who did not receive
                                formal scholastic instruction were instructed orally by the parish priests in the doctrines and duties of the Faith ; while the
                                pictures and statues with which the churches were adorned aided the direct teaching of sermons and catechizing in giving a
                                general knowledge of <title>Bible</title> history and of the legends of the saints.</p>
                            <p>No doubt, in times of spiritual and intellectual lethargy, the practice fell short of the theory ; but on the whole it may be
                                concluded that in medieval times the provision for higher instruction was adequate to the demand, and that, relatively to the
                                culture of the time, the mass of the people were by no means sunk in brutish ignorance. Indeed, especially when the paucity of
                                books before the invention of printing is borne in mind, the number of people who could read the vernacular, as evidenced by the
                                demand for books in the vulgar tongue as soon as printing made them available, is clear proof that the latter part of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> was by no means a time of general

                                At the same time the growth of national feeling was slowly but surely undermining feudalism. Moreover, deep resentment was
                                accumulating throughout western Europe against the practical abuses which had become prevalent in the Church, and especially in
                                the court of Rome and in the prince-bishoprics of Germany. In short, Europe was out-growing medieval institutions, which
                                appeared more and more as empty forms unable to satisfy the needs and longings of the human soul. In such conditions, the
                                customary and traditional education of school and university tended to lose touch more and more completely with the new
                                aspirations and views of life which were everywhere gathering adherents among the keenest and most active intellects. Had a new

                                (1265-1321) furnishes evidence that the poet of the scholastic philosophical theology was also a keen student and lover of the
                                old Latin poets. But the greatest impulse to the revived study of the classics was given by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrarch">Petrarch</name> (1304-1374) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Boccaccio">Boccaccio</name> (1313-1375). Generally throughout western Europe the
                                14th century, though full of war and political unrest, was a time of considerable intellectual activity, shown in the increase
                                of schools and universities, as well as in the literary and artistic revival in Italy, in the social and theological movement in
                                England and Bohemia associated with the names of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wycliffe">Wycliffe</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Hus">Huss</name>, and in the more or less
                                perfect substitution of Roman law everywhere except in England for the law of custom which had hitherto prevailed.</p>
                            <p>But it was the literary movement which most affected education, and indeed the whole life of Europe. A decisive step was taken
                                when <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuel_Chrysoloras">Manuel Chrysoloras</name> was invited to teach
                                Greek in <name type="institution">the university of Florence</name> in 1397. The enthusiasm for classical culture, to which
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrarch">Petrarch</name> had given so great an impetus, fathered force
                                and extended over the whole of Italy, though, of course, felt only by a select few and leaving the mass of the people little, if
                                at all, affected. From Italy it spread gradually to countries north of the Alps. In the old writers men found full expression of
                                that new spirit of self-conscious freedom which was vaguely striving for expression throughout the whole of Christendom. In the
                                free political atmosphere of the Italian communes, with their wealthy and leisured merchant class, that spirit could flourish
                                much more readily than in the feudalized Europe across the Alps. Moreover, the antique spirit was in direct line of ancestry
                                with that of medieval Italy. Thus, for a couple of centuries, Italy stood in the van of European culture.</p>
                            <p>The stages of the movement cannot be traced here: suffice it to say it showed itself especially in an enthusiastic search for
                                manuscripts, followed by their multiplication and wider distribution; in an intense devotion to literary form; in a revival of
                                classic taste in architecture; in a wonderful development of painting and sculpture from symbolism of spiritual qualities
                                towards naturalism and romanticism ; in a return to Platonism in philosophy; in a contempt, often unreasoning and wanting a
                                foundation in knowledge, for the scholastic Aristotelian philosophy itself, and not simply for the trivialities into which its
                                actual exercise had so commonly degenerated. The invention of printing necessarily gave the movement both a stronger and a wider
                                influence than it could otherwise have attained. And in its search after knowledge it was in full harmony with the spirit of
                                adventure which marked the age, and by the discovery of the New World wrought so profound a change in the relative importance
                                and prosperity of the countries of western Europe.</p>

                            <p>It is the spirit of the movement which is of interest to the student of education. And that spirit was essentially one of
                                opposition to authority and of assertion of individual liberty, which worked itself out in various forms among peoples of
                                different temperaments. In Italy the form was literary and artistic, and the full development of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the Renaissance</name> spirit was seen in a practical Paganism which
                                substituted the attractions of art for the claims of religion and morality, and eventuated in deep and widespread immorality and
                                a contemptuous tolerance of the outward observances of religion without faith in the doctrines they symbolized. The movement
                                became an attempt to reconstitute the past intellectual life of Italy, and, as such, was foredoomed to sterility as soon as the
                                work of re-discovery was completed; for the revived forms were not inspired with the vital spirit which had once made them
                                realities, and consequently men's minds once again were occupied with mere verbal subtleties. The really valuable service of the
                                Italian humanists to Europe was the restoration to man of the heritage of knowledge which he had allowed to slip from his grasp,
                                and the leading the way to a freer intellectual atmosphere. In Germany the spirit manifested itself in a rebellion against the
                                doctrinal system of the Church as the only effectual means of attaining reform of ecclesiastical abuses. The Protestant
                                reformation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> was the real German outcome of
                                    <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the Renaissance</name>. In no other country of Europe did
                                the movement take so distinctive a form.</p>
                            <p>It was, then, not merely the revival of interest in classical studies which so profoundly affected the life and education of
                                western Europe. It was rather that in those literatures men found a response to intellectual and moral cravings which had been
                                blindly gathering force for generations, and which found themselves formulated and objectified in the writings which set forth
                                the Pagan view of life with its assumption of the essential worth and self-reliance of the individual and its frank delight in
                                all the pleasures of existence. It was, in short, in proportion as men not only found delight in Pagan literature but returned
                                in essence to the Pagan view of individual worth and the supremacy of the human intellect, that the Church realized the danger
                                to herself which lurked in the new movement.</p>
                            <p>At first the revival of interest in the classical literatures did not show any antagonism to Catholic faith and practice, and its
                                warmest supporters were faithful sons of the Church. The view of the relation of classical literature to Christianity adopted by
                                the great humanist schoolmaster <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vittorino_da_Feltre">Vittorino da
                                    Feltre</name> (1378-1446) was broadly that of the early Fathers, and in his school at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantua">Mantua</name> he showed that culture was not inconsistent with loyalty to the
                                Church or with purity of life. With him classical literature was not the end and sum of education, but was a means of implanting
                                ideas, of developing taste, and of acquiring knowledge, all as helps and ornaments of a Christian life. Though Pagan literature
                                was the means of education, the Pagan spirit had not supplanted that of Christianity. The school at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantua">Mantua</name> may, indeed, be said to have exhibited in practice a Christianized
                                application of the doctrines of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch">Plutarch</name>.</p>
                            <p>So was it in the other countries of Christendom. In the Netherlands <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life">the Brethren of the Common Life</name> introduced humanistic
                                studies into their schools side by side with definite religious teaching and observances and their work was always <pb n="958" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0958.png"/>
                                dominated by the Christian spirit. The earlier German humanists, such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_of_Kues">Nicholas de Cusa</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Hegius_von_Heek">Hegius</name>, <name type="person">Agricola</name>

                                life. In England the same love of culture combined with devotion to the Church was seen in <name type="person">Selling</name>,
                                prior of <name type="institution">Christ Church</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canterbury">Canterbury</name>, the first real English humanist, in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Grocyn">Grocyn</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Linacre">Linacre</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_More">More</name>, <name type="person">Fisher</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Colet">Colet</name> and many others whose enthusiasm for culture was as undoubted as
                                was their loyalty to Catholicism. It seemed, then, at first as if the greatest educational effect of the classical revival would
                                be the deepening of literary culture, and the substitution of real inquiry for dialectic subtleties in the courses of schools
                                and universities, without any break with established religious teaching. It is true that the majority of schools were but little
                                affected, and many of the universities had given but a half-hearted welcome to humanistic studies when the religious revolt in

                                whole of Europe into two hostile camps. But even the conservative <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Paris">university of Paris</name> —the headquarters of scholastic

That the influence
                                of the new movement for classical study was gradually permeating the schools is shown not only by the practice of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life">the Brethren of the Common Life</name> but

                            <p>The immediate effect of the religious controversies of the 16th century on education was emphatically, if unintentionally,
                                disastrous. The secularization of ecclesiastical property too often absorbed the endowments of the schools, so that, both in
                                Germany and in England, the majority of grammar schools either disappeared or continued a starved existence with diminished
                                funds; the doctrine of salvation by faith alone and the futility of good works dried up the source from which such endowments
                                had flowed; the violent fulminations of the German reformers against the universities as the homes of the hated scholastic
                                theology and philosophy found an echo in minds fired with the renaissance enthusiasm for poetry and oratory, and correlative
                                distaste for the more severe and abstract speculations of logic and philosophy, which expressed itself in abstention from those
                                seats of learning ; the preoccupation of men's minds with theological speculations and quarrels led those few who did resort to
                                the universities to neglect their appointed studies and to devote their energies to interminable wrangling over the points in
                                dispute. This decadence in culture was attended by an outbreak of licence and immorality, especially among the young, which
                                called forth violent denunciations from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> and
                                many of his followers in Germany, and from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Latimer">Latimer</name> and
                                other reformers in England. In some respects these results were only transitory. Humanism and Protestantism, which had so far
                                diverged that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name> (1467-1536) had declared
                                that where Lutheranism flourished learning decayed, were brought together again by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name> (1497-156o) under whose influence universities were
                                founded or reorganized and schools re-established in Protestant German states ; and in England the reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth</name> saw many new educational foundations. But this
                                restoration of the means of education was only partial, and the doctrine of the worthlessness of <q>" carnal knowledge,"</q>
                                which led <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barebone's_Parliament">the Barebone's Parliament</name> to
                                propose the suppression of the English universities, was held by many fervent Protestants both in England and in Germany all
                                through the 17th century.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, the schools established a tradition of curriculum and instruction which ignored the new directions of men's thoughts
                                and the new view of knowledge as something to be enlarged, and not merely a deposit to be handed down from generation to
                                generation. The later humanist theories of education, which the schools continued to follow generally for over two centuries,
                                and in many cases for another hundred years after that, were drawn mainly from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, who found in the classical languages and
                                literatures, and especially in Latin, the only essential instruments of education. General knowledge of natural facts might be
                                desirable to the cultured man as ornaments to his rhetoric, but it was to be sought in the writings of antiquity. Even so
                                revolutionary a thinker on education as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Rabelais">Rabelais</name>
                                (1495-1553) with all his demand for an encyclopaedic curriculum, held the writings of the ancients as authoritative on natural
                                phenomena. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, whose conception of
                                instruction was much narrower, exercised enormous influence in the moulding of Protestant universities and secondary schools,
                                both directly and through such disciples as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valentin_Friedland">Trotzendorf</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joachim_Neander">Neander</name>, but especially
                                through his friend <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johannes_Sturm">Sturm</name> (1507-1589), whose Latin
                                gymnasium at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg">Strassburg</name> became the model which the
                                grammar schools of Protestant Europe strove to imitate. In this school nearly the whole of the energies of the boys was given to
                                acquiring a mastery of the Latin language after the model of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johannes_Sturm">Sturm</name>, indeed, did not go to the

                                be found in the extant writings of their master, but a like spirit dominated him.</p>

                            <p>In Catholic countries the Church retained control of education. The practical reformation of abuses by the Council of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trento">Trent</name>, and the energy and skill of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Society_of_Jesus">the Society of Jesus</name>, founded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ignatius_of_Loyola">St. Ignatius Loyola</name>, in 1534, brought back most of south Germany
                                into the fold of the Church. Everywhere Catholic universities were mainly taught by Jesuit fathers ; and under their influence,
                                scholasticism, purged from the excretions which had degraded it, was restored, and continued to satisfy the longings of minds
                                which felt the need of an authoritative harmonizing of faith and knowledge. Everywhere the society established schools, which,
                                by their success in teaching and the mildness of their discipline, attracted thousands of pupils who came even from Protestant
                                homes. Their curriculum was purely classical, but it was elaborated with much skill, and the methods of instruction and
                                discipline were made the subject of much thought and of long-continued experiment. In the methods thus determined all Jesuit
                                fathers were trained, so that the teachers in Jesuit schools attained a degree of skill in their art which was too generally

                            <p>So long as Latin remained the language of learning, and new fields of knowledge were not appropriated, the schools remained in
                                harmony with the culture of their time, though, as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Mulcaster">Mulcaster</name> (1530-1611) pointed out, such a training was not of value to the majority of boys. For them he urged an
                                elementary education in the vernacular; but neither in this nor in his advocacy of the training of teachers was his advice
                                followed.</p>
                            <p>In the 17th century the dislocation between the Latin schools and the needs of life began to be accentuated as Latin gradually
                                ceased to be the language of learning ; and, as a consequence, the numbers attending the schools decreased, and the mass of the
                                people sunk continually lower in ignorance. In vain <name type="person">Hoole</name> urged the establishment of a universal
                                system of elementary schools giving instruction in the vernacular, <name type="person">Petty</name> put forth his plan for
                                elementary trade schools, and Cowley proposed the establishment of a college devoted to research. Ideas of reform were in the
                                air, but the main current of scholastic practice flowed on unaffected by them. Some attention was, indeed, paid to the
                                conservative reforms advocated by the Port Royalists, of which the most important was the inclusion of the vernacular as a
                                branch of instruction, but the cry for more fundamental changes based on the philosophy of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> was unheeded. Of these, none was a more active propagandist

                            <p>In the universities, too, the 16th and 17th centuries saw a continuous decadence. The 16th century was not ripe for real
                                intellectual freedom; and Protestantism, having based its revolt on the right of private judgment, soon produced a number of
                                conflicting theological systems, vying with each other in rigidity and narrowness, which, as <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Paulsen">Paulsen</name> says, <quote>" nearly stifled the intellectual life
                                        of the German people."</quote>
                                </ref> Further, the idea of national autonomy, which exercised so great an effect on the
                                politics of the time, included the universal adherence of the citizens to the religion of the state. Hence, till the end of the
                                17th century the universities of Protestant Europe were regarded mainly as instruments for securing adhesion to the national
                                theological system on the part of future clergy and officials, and the state interfered more and more with their organization
                                and work. Theology occupied the most important place in the higher studies pursued, which for the rest differed little in
                                content and less in spirit from those of preceding centuries, except that more attention was paid to the study of classical
                                literature. Even that decayed into formal linguistics as the Renaissance enthusiasm for poetry and oratory died out, and
                                interest in logical and philosophical questions, fostered by the dominance of dogmatic controversial theology, again became
                                dominant. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, on the other hand, the faculty of theology
                                had decayed through the withdrawal of those preparing for the priesthood into episcopal seminaries, and the higher studies
                                pursued were mainly law and medicine. Thus, generally, the universities were less and less fulfilling the function of providing
                                a general liberal education. Another change, due to the same causes and making for the same results, was the isolation of
                                universities, often directly fostered by the state governments, which for the universal interchange of medieval thought
                                substituted a narrow provincial culture and outlook. It is no wonder that numbers everywhere decayed and that complaints as to
                                the habits of the students were loud and frequent.</p>

                            <p>At the close of the 17th century, then, universities as well as schools had reached a very low level of efficiency and were held
                                in little respect by the cultured. Indeed, from the middle of the century, the main current of intellectual life had drifted
                                away from the orthodox centres of learning. The formation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences">the Berlin Academy</name> in Germany and of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Society">the Royal Society</name> in England, and the refusal of

                                university, were signs of the times. In France, and later in Germany, the education of the noble youth was increasingly carried
                                on apart from the schools, and was really an outgrowth from the education of chivalry. In the 16th century <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldassare_Castiglione">Castiglione</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_de_Montaigne">Montaigne</name> had advocated a training directly adapted to prepare

                                the most important movement in this direction was the formation of the courtly academies which flourished in France in the 17th

                            <p>The later years of the 17th century saw a revival of university life in Cambridge, through the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> and the increasing attention paid to mathematics and the
                                physical sciences though the number of students continued very small. In Germany, also, a new era opened with the foundation of

                                from the first discarded the old conception that the function of a university is to pass on knowledge already complete, and so
                                opened the door of the German universities to the new culture and philosophy. It was soon seen that students could thus be
                                attracted, and the influence spread to the other German universities, which by the end of the 18th century had regained their
                                position as homes of the highest German thought.</p>

                            <p>Rousseauism, however, was not merely a transitory revolt against a conventionality of life that had become unbearable ; it was
                                emphatically the voicing of a view of life and of education which has profoundly influenced Europe ever since. In that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> (1712-1778) attempted to look at life
                                as a whole he was on truer ground than were the intellectualists of the <q>

                                </q> ; but in that he found the essence
                                of life in the gratification of the desires and impulses of the moment, he enunciated a doctrine which banished high principle
                                and strenuous effort from life and consequently from education. In the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emile:_or,_On_Education">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Emile</hi>
                                </title> is presented a purely
                                fantastic scheme of education based on a psychology of development so crude as to be absolutely false, and producing a young man
                                utterly unable to guide his own life or to control his emotions and impulses. Rousseauism is, indeed, in its essence the
                                application to education of the doctrines of naturalism—the philosophy which regards human life as a mere continuation of
                                physical process, and consequently as determined wholly by environment. So <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> would abolish all moral training and leave the child
                                to the reactions of the physical world upon his actions.</p>

                                </title>, is essentially a protest. The most necessary element in education, according to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</name>, is constraint, which by the formation of habit prepares the
                                young to receive as principles of conduct the laws at first imposed upon them from without. And the supreme guide of life is the
                                law of duly which is always more or less opposed to the promptings of inclination. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immanuel_Kant">Kant</name> exaggerates the dualism : <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> would abolish it by ignoring the more important of

                                second stage in the movement of which the Reformation was the first. It was essentially the assertion of the natural rights of
                                man, and, as a logical sequence, of the right of every child to be properly trained for life. The reaction due to the excesses
                                of the revolutionists no doubt delayed the acknowledgment for a time, but its gradual recognition is emphatically the

                                (1746-1827) in Switzerland, the general education of the poor was first made a reality by Prussia after the crushing defeat of
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jena">Jena</name>. In France and England it remained for nearly
                                threequarters of the century the work of the Church and other voluntary agencies, though aided by the state. Finally a state
                                system of schools has been more or less fully set up in every state of western Europe and in America, and subjected to more or
                                less state regulation and control. Equally marked has been the growing care for the scholastic education of girls as well as
                                boys, though only in America are the two regarded as practically identical in form and content.</p>
                            <p>Thus the 19th century saw the final working out of the idea that the state should be substituted for the Church as the official
                                agent of education, an idea which had its roots in the Renaissance conception of the right of man to direct his life apart from
                                theological determinations. The more direct outcome of the same idea is apparent in the absolute liberty with which the
                                presuppositions of knowledge are questioned, and the maxim of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/René_Descartes">Descartes</name>— to prove everything by the reason and to accept nothing
                                which fails to stand the test—is acted upon. No greater contrast is possible than that between the medieval student and the
                                modern searcher after truth.</p>

                            <p>The influence of the same spirit has wrought an equally momentous change in the methods of instruction. The impetus given by the

                                that the nature of the child should determine the means of education, led to more thorough-going attempts than had hitherto been
                                made to base educational method on a knowledge of child psychology. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Fröbel">Froebel</name> (1782-1852), by their insistence on the need of educating
                                a child through his own activity, and by their widespread influence, made the new view of method an actuality. The influence of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> has, thus, passed into modern
                                educational practice in a form that, in its essence, is true, though in practice it has shown itself apt to run into the same
                                excess of emphasis on impulse and feeling which vitiated the teaching of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> himself. The influence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Friedrich_Herbart">Herbart</name> (1776-1841) has tended to counteract this. The
                                essence of Herbartianism is that mental life consists of presentations, or reactions of the mind on the environment, and that
                                will springs from the circle of thought thus developed. The emphasis is therefore placed on intellect and instruction while in
                                Froebelianism it is placed on spontaneous activity and on the arrangement of the environment. Each exaggerates the function of
                                the one factor in concrete experience which it makes the centre of interest, and each is tinged with the individualistic
                                conception of life which characterized the 18th and early 19th century.</p>

                            <p>The most marked change in the outward aspect of education has been the modification of the curriculum of school and university by
                                the introduction of various branches of natural science. Conjointly with this has been much increase of specialization, and that
                                not only in the university but in the school. There is no longer a universally recognized circle of knowledge constituting a
                                liberal education preparatory to specialist studies, as there was in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. Nor is there general agreement as to what such
                                educational institutions as schools and universities should attempt to do, or even as to the end that should be sought by
                                education as a whole. Nor can agreement on such points be expected while men differ widely as to the meaning and purpose of
                                life. The work of the organization of the material means of education has largely been accomplished by the civilized world: that
                                of determining the true theory and practice of the educative process itself is still incomplete. To that, both discussion of the
                                philosophy of life and of the relative values in life, of various kinds of experience and experiment in the light of the
                                conclusions reached, are needed. The problem will never be absolutely solved, for that would imply an absolutely best education
                                irrespective of conditions, but its practical solution will be reached when a true adjustment is made between the process of
                                education and the life for which that education is intended to be a preparation.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>A statement of the principles commonly recognized by modern communities as governing the action of the state in relation to
                                education may facilitate at the outset a clearer understanding of the problems which the organization of public education
                                presents. The cardinal doctrine of state interference in the educational domain is universally accepted by all the great nations
                                of the modern world; and in regard to its extent and limits a large measure of agreement has now been reached.</p>

                            <p>In the first place, it is recognized as the duty of the state to insist upon a certain minimum of education for every future
                                citizen. This does not necessitate a monopoly of education on the part of the state, such as was claimed by the Napoleonic
                                despotism under the traditional (it would seem) of the old authoritative Gallo-Roman tradition, transformed in its outward
                                manifestation but not in its inward spirit by the French Revolution. Such a monopoly would be plainly repugnant to the spirit of
                                Anglo- Saxon individualism, and it is interesting to note that attempts to reassert it have in recent times been repudiated in
                                republican France by some of the best exponents of modern free thought, as an infringement of personal liberty not calculated to
                                justify itself by any corresponding public gain. Nevertheless, the recognition of this primary duty of the state plainly implies
                                a state system of at least elementary education. The masses of the industrial population cannot afford the necessary minimum of
                                instruction which the public interest demands, and private and voluntary effort cannot efficiently supply the want resulting
                                from the unequal distribution of wealth. But it is in the nature of things that, so far as private effort attempts anything in
                                this direction, it should be motived in the main by religion and associated with the great historical religious organizations;
                                thus it comes about that the moment the state steps in to make good the deficiency of voluntary effort a fruitful and
                                embittering source of difficulty and friction is disclosed. Hence, in England, the history of public elementary education since
                                the beginning of the 19th century has been very largely the history of what is called the religious difficulty. Here we find
                                ourselves in the region of acute controversy in which it is useless to do more than note empirically the various solutions
                                adopted by different states. Perhaps all that can safely be indicated as commanding universal acceptance is the principle that
                                the state must not impose upon an individual citizen in the person of his child any form of religious instruction to which he
                                conscientiously objects. Modern controversies show the difficulty of applying even this rudimentary principle to the complicated
                                circumstances of a free community split up into a number of groups differing profoundly in religious sentiment, and zealous each
                                for the recognition of its own ideal within the common system. So far, however, as secular instruction (i.e. the teaching of
                                other subjects than religion) is concerned it is now generally accepted that the elementary minimum must be both compulsory and
                                free for every individual child whose parents will not or cannot (as the case may be) provide such instruction for it
                                efficiently elsewhere than in the state-supported schools.</p>
                            <p>Next, the action of the modern state cannot stop short at elementary education. The principle of <q>" the career open to talent
                                    "</q> is no longer a matter of abstract humanitarian theory, a fantastical aspiration of revolutionary dreamers ; for the
                                great industrial communities of the modern world it is a cogent practical necessity imposed by the fierce international
                                competition which prevails in the arts and industries of life. The nation that is not to fail in the struggle for commercial
                                success, with all that this implies for national life and civilization, must needs see that its industries are fed with a
                                constant supply of workers adequately equipped in respect both of general intelligence and technical training.</p>
                            <p>On political grounds too, the increasing democratization of <pb n="961" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0961.png"/> institutions renders a wide diffusion of knowledge and
                                the cultivation of a high standard of intelligence among the people a necessary precaution of prudent statesmanship, especially
                                for the great imperial states which confide the most-momentous issues of world policy to the arbitrament of the popular voice.
                                The state then must satisfy itself that the means of education are placed within the reach of all, in grades adapted to the
                                varying degrees of intelligence and educational opportunity to be found among a community upon the majority of whose members is
                                imposed the necessity of entering upon the practical business of life at a more or less early age. The organization of the
                                higher grades of education constitutes a task of less formidable magnitude than the organization of elementary education, for
                                the reason that, at any rate in the prevailing social conditions, it is only a minority who can benefit by it, and that of this
                                minority a large proportion can afford the whole or a considerable portion of the cost in each individual case. The class,
                                however, whose education must needs be assisted by the state if it is not to remain inefficient must always be considerable ;
                                and account must be taken also of the necessities of the further class whose exceptional mental development is such as to make
                                it worth while for the state to bestow gratuitously an education higher than elementary at the public expense. University
                                education is distinguished from education of the lower grades by the fact that, being necessarily restricted to an elite of
                                intellect or birth, it cannot, save in very exceptional circumstances, usefully be organized locally. Although universities are
                                the necessary complement of a public educational system they do not in strictness or necessity form part of such a system, and
                                in so far as they are brought within the purview of public authority it must be as a matter of national, rather than municipal
                                or provincial, concern. Accordingly university education is separately treated (see UNIVERSITIES), and will not be referred to,
                                save incidentally, in the present article.</p>
                            <p>Reserving to a final section the history of education in the United States of America, a brief description is given here of the
                                educational systems of the leading European countries by way of introduction to a more detailed, but still summary, historical
                                sketch of public education in England. The highly organized educational systems of France and Prussia (as representing Germany)
                                are manifestly suitable for the purposes of a general study of the principles of educational polity as worked out upon logical
                                and consistently thought-out plans by highly centralized states. As to other European countries, a brief mention must suffice of
                                certain features of special interest presented by smaller progressive states of such different types as Switzerland, Belgium and
                                Holland. Similarly, in the case of the United Kingdom, considerations of space forbid more than a brief notice of the
                                educational systems of Scotland (q.v.) and Ireland (q.v.). For other countries see the sections in the articles under the
                                headings of the respective states.</p>

                                <p>France (q.v.) presents the most complete type of a state system of education organized under a strongly centralized
                                    administration in all grades. This centralized administration in education, as in other departments, represents the
                                    Napoleonic heritage of the Republic, and, although there has been an increasing tendency of recent years to study local
                                    conditions in the internal organization of schools, anything approaching to local autonomy is unknown in educational
                                    affairs: The necessary checks upon bureaucracy are supplied not by popularly elected municipal bodies but by a strong
                                    infusion of the pedagogic element in the administrative machinery. The pedagogic element in turn does but represent another
                                    side of the collective activities of the state. The teaching profession both in the primary and higher spheres— and the two
                                    are sharply marked off from one another—consists of a highly organized body of state functionaries, united by a strong

                                    inspired by the state. The importance of this condition of things lies in the fact that the Republic is something more than
                                    a form of government : it is the social and moral expression of the democratic ideal as conceived by a people profoundly
                                    imbued by tradition with the sense of social sohdarity, or collectivism; and nowhere has this expression been more
                                    characteristic or more complete than in the domain of public education. Yet the educational system of modern France is by no

                                    has never ceased to exert a profound influence upon French education, an influence which of late years has been revivified

                                    character of the moral instruction, it would appear to have shifted from a Kantian to a purely sociological basis. Roman
                                    Catholic opinion is at least not unanimous in regarding the <q>" lay "</q> or neutral school as essentially or necessarily
                                    anti-religious, and plainly there is no inherent reason why the neutrality should not be a real neutrality, but with the
                                    existing relations between the Catholic Church and modern thought in France the influence of the Normalist teachers is in
                                    fact apt to be anti-religious, and moreover no system of independent moral doctrine, whether based upon a priori or
                                    inductive reasoning, can be acceptable to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Catholic Church</name>. In whatever degree the blame may be rightly apportionable between church and state,
                                    the fact is that the two find themselves in acute conflict, and that from the conflict there has resulted a certain moral
                                    confusion which Christian and non- Christian moralists alike view with alarm. It may be that the mischief would have been
                                    mitigated had more moderate counsels prevailed at the time of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Ferry">Ferry</name> law, and had the church been willing to accept (as <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Republic</name> might then have been
                                    willing to concede) right of entry for the clergy into the schools. But the real causes of the trouble lie deep in the
                                    philosophical and religious problems of our time, and in the constant and selfsacrificing devotion of the French to logical
                                    ideals on either side. Perhaps it is not too sanguine to discern in the growing tendency to idealism in French philosophy,
                                    and to liberal ideas in French and Catholic religious thought, the promise of a happier state of things. In the meantime,
                                    the religious difficulty in the schools divides the nation into two hostile camps (<foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                <p>In the year 1903-1904 the total number of pupils in private primary schools was 1,298,591, as against 4,935,000 in the public
                                    primary schools, but these figures were liable to be materially affected by the rigorous enforcement of the laws against the
                                    religious orders.</p>

                                <p>In 1889 an important change was made in educational finance by transferring the cost of teachers' salaries in primary schools
                                    from the communes to the state, a right consequence of the changes which made the teacher a state official. Thus the state
                                    assumed the greater part of the burden of primary instruction, leaving to the communes merely the cost of fabric, and to the
                                    department the maintenance of the fabric of the normal schools and certain expenses of inspection.</p>

                                <p>In proceeding to sketch the French system of higher primary and secondary schools, it may be observed that European systems
                                    of higher education have generally been framed upon the view that the divisions of education are longitudinal, not
                                    latitudinal, and that secondary education is a training complete in itself from the preparatory stage to the university,
                                    with aims and ideals of general culture which differentiate it radically and at the very outset from education of the
                                    elementary type. On the other hand, in the United States the view has prevailed that the divisions of education must be
                                    latitudinal, that the secondary school must be complementary to the elementary school, in which even the elite must receive
                                    their preparatory or elementary training. At any rate down to the reform of 1902, which will presently be explained, the
                                    French system could be regarded as a typical and even extreme example of the European theory, little consistent as this
                                    might seem to be with the broader principles of democracy. This view of the matter is expressed by the French terminology,
                                    by which what in England is called <q>" elementary "</q> is in France termed <q>"primary"</q> education.</p>

                                    school is to continue education in this spirit up to the age of sixteen so as to prepare the scholar to take an honourable

                                    pursuits for which he is unfitted, not so much by the accidents of birth and social circumstance as by his own natural
                                    aptitudes. Within the limits necessarily marked out for them the higher primary schools of France have aimed at imparting
                                    what may be termed a general culture as distinct from purely technical or trade teaching, and this development has been
                                    greatly furthered by the separate organization given to the latter teaching in the <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                    and in the rural districts a special agricultural bias is imparted to the curriculum. It is interesting to note that the
                                    institution of the higher primary schools was due in large part to the spontaneous initiative of the municipalities, and
                                    that in the later phases of state organization special care has been taken to avoid anything in the nature of a rigid

                                    traditional view of secondary education as a self-contained whole. Article I of the decree of May 31, 1902, declares that
                                    secondary education is co-ordinated with primary education in such a way as to constitute a continuation of a course of
                                    primary studies of a normal education, duration of four years. The decree goes on to provide for a full course of secondary
                                    studies of seven years' duration, divided into two cycles of four and three years respectively. In the first cycle the

                                    as a pseudo-liberty by the advanced republican educationists, and the principle that education is a function of the state
                                    and not a matter of supply and demand is deeply rooted in the public mind. Proposals have been mooted for making the

                                    adoption of any such measure would practically destroy liberty of teaching by reason of the power which the <foreign xml:lang="fr">baccalauréat</foreign> secures to the state as the key to the professions.</p>

                                <p>The foundation of secondary schools for girls in connexion with the educational reform of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Ferry">Jules Ferry</name> is in its way one of the most notable achievements of

                                    doubt that the expulsion of the religious orders is destined to exercise a profound influence upon the education of women in
                                    France. The place of the closed convent schools is being taken either by new state schools or by Catholic schools under lay
                                    teachers, and the numbers of scholars affected by this process of laicization is far larger in the case of girls than of
                                    boys. This change is calculated to produce farreaching effects in the social and religious order, by no means necessarily,
                                    however, of an anti-Catholic or irreligious kind.</p>

                                <p>Under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">the German empire</name> education is left to
                                    the exclusive control of each of the federated states. The only point of direct contact between <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">the Empire</name> and education lies in the mutual undertaking of the
                                    federated states to bring the law of compulsory school attendance to bear upon all subjects of the empire resident within
                                    their respective borders. Of far greater moment is the moral influence exerted upon the other states by the Prussian
                                    hegemony, in virtue of which the Prussian educational system comes to be in all essential characteristics typical and
                                    representative of Germany as a whole. It is remarkable that though, as <ref>

                                    a comprehensive education law, owing to the religious and political difficulties with which any general legislative
                                    assertion of principle is attended in Germany as in England. The consequence is that the Prussian system in particular is
                                    the result of a long and complicated series of special laws, decrees and administrative regulations. In such circumstances
                                    it is inevitable that, especially in secondary education, some considerable local variations and anomalies should remain,
                                    but the centralized authority of the state has confined these to questions of patronage and external administration, and
                                    even within this sphere has successfully asserted its own ultimate supremacy as the guardian of the educational interests of
                                    its citizens. A detailed historical study would bring out clearly the intimate connexion between the development of the
                                    educational system and the growth of the Prussian state, and again between these and the expansion of the national life of
                                    the German people; incidentally it would exhibit the supremacy of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in the modern Empire as the inevitable result not merely of
                                    military force but of a genuine hegemony of intellect and culture.</p>

                                <p>Stress is rightly laid by all educational writers upon <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name>'s famous letter to the German municipalities in 1524, urging upon them the duty of providing schools and
                                    upon parents the duty of sending their children to school. An attempt to give effect to this teaching was at once made by
                                    the electoral government of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>, which by a school
                                    ordinance of 1528 provided for the establishment in every town and village of Latin schools, for in Germany as in England
                                    the influence of the Protestant reformers was solidly on the side of classical education as the key to the study of the
                                    Scriptures and theological learning. All the more remarkable, therefore, was the initiative of the electorate of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name>, whose school ordinance of 1559 represents
                                    the first systematic attempt to make provision for both elementary and higher education, directing that elementary schools
                                    should be set up throughout the country, and <foreign xml:lang="de">

                                    Latin schools in every considerable centre of population. The educational efforts both of the early Reformers and of the
                                    remarkable Jesuit educationists, who contributed so largely to the partial reconquest of south Germany for the Catholic
                                    Church, were brought to naught amid the troublous times of the Thirty Years' War, and the desolation and national decadence
                                    which that calamity brought in its train. To this result the aridity of the Protestant scholastics who succeeded <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, and the frivolity, incompetence and petty
                                    despotism of the small German courts, contributed in no slight measure. The permanent and positive value of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name>'s pronouncement of 1524 consists not so much
                                    in the direct effects which it produced as in the hallowed association which it established for Protestant Germany between
                                    the national religion and the educational duties of the individual and the state, and doubtless this association largely
                                    contributed to the creation of <pb n="965" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0965.png"/> that healthy public opinion which in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> rendered the principle of compulsory school attendance easy of

                                <p>State interference in education is almost coincident with the rise of the Prussian state. Already in 1717 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_William_I_of_Prussia">Frederick William I.</name> ordered all children to
                                    attend school where schools existed, and fixed the fee at 5 pf. (1/2 d.) a week. This was followed in 1736 by edicts for the
                                    establishment of schools in certain provinces and by a royal grant of 50,000 thalers for that purpose in the following year.
                                    In 1763 the <foreign xml:lang="de">

                                    which the Prussian state has since proceeded, asserting the principle of compulsory school attendance, fixing the fees, with
                                    provision for the assistance of very poor children, prescribing the course of instruction, and giving directions for the
                                    examination and supervision of teachers. Much progress was made, more especially in the organization of higher education,
                                    under <name type="person">Baron von Zedlitz</name>, who was appointed minister for Lutheran church and school affairs by

                                    organization of secondary education in Germany. As in England, the fear of the French Revolution produced a corresponding
                                    reaction in educational affairs, and the policy of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_William_II_of_Prussia">Frederick William II.</name> was to bind ever closer
                                    school and church in a system practically independent of state control. The first departure from this policy was marked by

It may,
                                    however, be observed that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name>'s
                                    policy in secondary education represents a compromise between the narrow philological pedantry of the old Latin schools and
                                    the large demands of the new humanism of the period; and the recent reform of the Prussian secondary schools may be said to
                                    represent a return to the spirit of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> in this respect. The measure introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> in 1810 for the state examination and
                                    certification of teachers checked the then common practice of permitting unqualified theological students to teach in the
                                    schools, and at once raised the teaching profession to a high level of dignity and efficiency which of itself sufficed to
                                    place <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in the forefront of educational progress.
                                    It was due also to the initiative of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> that the methods of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</name> were introduced into the teachers' seminaries, through them to vitalize the elementary schools. To

                                <p>Though the period which succeeded the peace of 1815 was one of political reaction, the cabinet order of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia">Frederick William III.</name> in 1825 strengthened
                                    the law of compulsory attendance and carried on the work of administrative organization by defining the duties of the
                                        <foreign xml:lang="de">Provinzial-Schul-Kollegium</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="de">Regierung</foreign>. In 1834
                                    an important development was given to secondary education by making it necessary for candidates for the learned professions
                                    as well as for the civil service, and for university studies, to have passed the leaving examination of the gymnasia. Thus
                                    through the leaving examination the state holds the key to the liberal careers, and has thereby been able to impose its own
                                    standard upon all secondary schools. Apart from the privileges relative to professional studies, the system of leaving
                                    examinations has exerted a wide influence upon popular education in connexion with the institution of compulsory military
                                    service, in virtue of a regulation which entitles those who pass the leaving examination of any of the recognized kinds of
                                    secondary schools to the much-coveted privilege of service for one year as a <q>" volunteer "</q> instead of two years as an

                                <p>The revolutionary and national movement of 1848 was followed by a period of further educational activity. <title>The Act of
                                        Constitution</title> of 1850 declared teachers civil servants and elementary education free. In practice, the abolition
                                    of school fees did not become general until 1888. Since then the view has more and more prevailed that elementary education

                                    the state alone to the supervision of the schools; but the severity of this law as a measure against Roman Catholic clerical
                                    education was considerably modified as a result of the subsequent reconciliation with the papacy under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Leo_III">Leo XIII.</name>, and the Prussian system remains to-day both for
                                    Catholics and Protestants essentially denominational. All schools, whether elementary or secondary, are Evangelical,
                                    Catholic, Jewish or mixed. In the elementary sphere, in particular, recourse is only had to the mixed school (<foreign xml:lang="de">

                                    cases the teachers are appointed with reference to religious faith; religious instruction is given compulsorily in school
                                    hours and is inspected by the clergy. The general purport of <title>the Prussian school law of 1906</title> is to strengthen
                                    the system of separate confessional schools, which it extends to certain provinces where it had not previously been in

                                    of selection of the type of school, and even of suggestion for the modification of recognized types, as is shown by the

Still, the

                                    taught in the morning and half in the afternoon. During the summer months, owing to the exigencies of agricultural labour,
                                    many single-class schools are taught as half-day schools. The system of course is regarded as a makeshift, but in this, as
                                    in the matter of buildings for rural elementary schools, the Prussian administration attaches great weight to the
                                    consideration of financial economy. As regards staff, a large measure of economy is rendered possible by the high average
                                    standard of merit reached by German elementary teachers, whose powers of oral exposition have struck English observers as
                                    specially remarkable, and again by the national readiness to be content with a moderate salary in return for official

                                    to English educationists, that adequate value for the heavy expenditure of public funds upon education can only be obtained
                                    by providing for the continued education for two or three years of the children of the working classes who leave school at
                                    fourteen years of age. One of the educational results of the war of 1870, with its great lesson of the importance of
                                    national education, was the <title>Saxon law</title> of 1873 making attendance at continuation schools compulsory for three
                                    years (i.e. up to seventeen) in that kingdom. The Saxon law appears to have been justified by the experience of nearly a
                                    generation. It must suffice here to note the following features of its working. (1) The schools are taught by the primary
                                    teachers, supplemented in the towns by some technical instructors. (2) The school session may be either for the whole year
                                    or for only half the year, and may also be held on Sunday, like the old English secular Sunday schools. (3) The schools are
                                    brought into close relation with trades, not only for purposes of curriculum, but also with a view to considering the
                                    exigencies and meeting the convenience of employers with respect to hours of attendance. (4) The discipline of the
                                    continuation school is extended to supervision out of school hours. <quote>" Visits to dancing-halls and all such
                                        exhibitions as are dangerous to uprightness and purity are forbidden to scholars of continuation schools."</quote>
                                    Further, useful institutions such as savings banks, and also associations for social intercourse and the promotion of

                                    schools. There is no doubt that in this matter of continuation schools, as in so many other fields of social organization,
                                    the adoption of compulsion has been facilitated by the habituation of the working classes to compulsory military service,
                                    which has made the German workman more disciplined, more <q>" organizable "</q> as a social unit, more accustomed to
                                    subordinate the principle of individual freedom and self-will to the collective claims of the state, than the workman reared
                                    in the traditions of Anglo-Saxon individualism.</p>
                                <p>Attendance at continuation schools is now compulsory by state law in 12 states, including (besides <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>) <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baden">Baden</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name>.

                                    <hi rend="italic">First-grade Schools.</hi>—One of the most striking features of German secondary education is the careful
                                    differentiation of schools according to the type of curriculum adopted. Thus, every German school is a homogeneous unit with
                                    a definite educational aim and organization, conforming to a common standard approved by public authority for the particular
                                    type to which it belongs. Hence the importance attached by the Germans to nomenclature; so that in selecting a <foreign xml:lang="de">Gymnasium</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> or an <foreign xml:lang="de">Oberrealschule</foreign>, the parent knows exactly the type of education he is going to secure for his son. In England,
                                    on the other hand, as has often been observed, a great school tends to multiply within itself different types of curricula
                                    in a haphazard way according to the demand of parents, whose original choice of school is based rather on social than on
                                    educational grounds. Modern sides, army classes and engineering classes grow up as excrescences upon an originally classical
                                    type, with the waste of power that results from loss of consistency and concentration of purpose. The difference between the
                                    English and German systems is due ultimately to the adoption in Germany of the day-school system and the absence, very
                                    remarkable in an otherwise aristocratically governed country, of the caste spirit in education above the elementary level,
                                    thanks to which the nobly born are not ashamed to sit on the school bench side by side with the children of the trading
                                    classes. On the other hand, the English boarding-school system, despite all the want of social solidarity, and all the class
                                    jealousy and exclusiveness with which it is inevitably associated, has admittedly favoured those ideals of the cultivation
                                    of character as distinct from book-learning which give a special value to what is in England called a public school
                                    education.</p>

                                <p>The present differentiation of first-grade schools in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> is the result of a natural educational development corresponding with the economic changes which have
                                    transformed <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> and the empire from an agricultural
                                    to an industrial state. It was in 1855 that semi-classical schools (teaching Latin without Greek) were first recognized for
                                    a nine years' course under the title of <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule I. Ordnung</foreign>, and in 1871 pupils
                                    possessing their leaving certificates were admitted to mathematical studies in the universities. The Latinless <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule II. Ordnung</foreign> is the direct product of the great industrial development of the modern
                                    empire. In 1882 the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule I. Ordnung</foreign> received the title of <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule II. Ordnung</foreign> that of <foreign xml:lang="de">Oberrealschule</foreign>, both types being at the same time admitted to certain privileges in the universities, schools

These two types
                                    differ from each other in detail, but the feature which distinguishes both from the older types is the postponement of Latin
                                    to Untertertia. The design is to secure for all types of secondary education a common non-classical base coextensive with
                                    the first three years of school life, followed by a bifurcation or threefold choice between the classical, semiclassical and
                                    non-classical types. The principle of the <q>" reform-school "</q> has been adopted in a considerable number of German
                                    (chiefly Prussian) schools, but it would be premature to see in it at present more than a new variety of <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> or semiclassical school ; it can hardly be said as yet to have affected the course
                                    of classical studies in the full sense. The widespread sentiment of discontent with the old philological type of classical
                                    school was vigorously expressed in a private letter written by the emperor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor">William II.</name> as crown prince of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in 1885, but not published until some years later. In December
                                    1890 the Prussian ministry convoked a conference at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> of secondary school experts, and the emperor presided in person at the opening session. His Majesty
                                    delivered a speech criticizing the Gymnasia as wanting a national basis. <quote>" It is our duty to educate young men to
                                        become young Germans and not young Greeks or Romans"</quote> was the keynote of the imperial discourse. The outcome of
                                    the conference was a shortening of the hours allowed to Latin in the Gymnasia, a reduction of the hours of study in view of
                                    over-pressure, and an expression of official opinion adverse to the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>. These
                                    changes, introduced in 1892, did not go far enough to satisfy the reformers, whilst the reduction of the hours allowed for
                                    Latin caused misgivings among the upholders of the traditional Gymnasium. Moreover, the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> showed greater vitality among the large towns than its official critics anticipated. The
                                    ensuing decade witnessed a certain reaction in favour of the classical humanities as a barrier against the materialistic
                                    influences of the new industrialism. At the same time the protagonists of the classics came to recognize that side by side
                                    with the old humanities there must be accorded to modern and scientific subjects that place in the high-grade schools which
                                    the practical exigencies of industrial life demanded. Thus, the opinion grew that the best line of defence for the classical
                                    schools lay in the concession of equal privileges to the non-classical types ; in this way only could the classical schools
                                    be kept safe from demands upon their time that could not be conceded without endangering their proper work. It was upon this
                                    basis that an agreement was reached between the contending parties at a second school conference that met in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> in June 1900. As the result of this conference there
                                    was issued a royal decree laying down certain general principles, of which the following are the most important. <list>
                                        <item>(1) There must be equality of privileges as between classical, semiclassical and non-classical first-grade
                                            schools. The decree recognizes, however, that this principle must be applied with a certain elasticity and with due
                                            regard to the necessity for training in particular branches of knowledge as a preliminary to certain lines of
                                            university study and certain professional pursuits. Consequently the Prussian system of privileges has become
                                            extremely complicated, and it is truer to speak, as the decree goes on to do, of an extension of the privileges of
                                            the nonclassical schools, rather than of absolute equality.</item>
                                        <item>(2) <quote>" In thus acknowledging the equality of the three types of higher institutions, it will be possible
                                                more thoroughly to strengthen the special characteristics of each type. In this connexion," the royal decree
                                                proceeds, " I shall offer no objection to an increase in the number of hours devoted to Latin in the Gymnasium
                                                and <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>."</quote> Thus, both as to the place of Latin in the
                                            curriculum of classical schools and as to the status of semi-classical schools, the decree of 1900 involves a
                                            reversal of the policy of 1890.</item>

                                <p>Notwithstanding the growing official encouragement of education upon semi-classical or non-classical lines, the upper and
                                    professional classes of Germany continue to show a marked preference for the fully classical Gymnasium; hence, in Germany as
                                    in England, the tendency for a widening gulf to disclose itself between the education of the directing classes in politics
                                    and administration and the bulk of the industrial population, which suggests that the problem of combining in just
                                    proportions the liberal and practical elements in a thoroughly national system of education has not yet reached the solution
                                    that the needs of the age require.</p>

                                <p>The cantonal organization of education presents the variety which the extraordinary diversity of race, language, religion and
                                    physical conditions of the component states of the federation would lead one to expect. The large <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canton_of_Berne">canton of Bern</name> may be instanced as the type of a strong central
                                    authority. The commune or parish is the unit for elementary education. The communal council nominates a school board of at
                                    least five members, whose function is to spend the money voted for school purposes by the general communal council. Several
                                    communes in combination form a district authority for the support of what are in reality higher primary schools, though
                                    called in Switzerland <foreign xml:lang="de">
                                        <hi rend="italic">Sekundarschulen</hi>
                                    </foreign>, maintained by the district.
                                    The maintenance both of the primary and higher primary schools is aided by grants from the central authority. The true
                                    secondary schools, called middle or higher schools, are maintained and controlled by the central or cantonal authority. The
                                    existence of separate local authorities for each grade of education is characteristic of Switzerland generally, this system
                                    being the opposite to that adopted in England in 1902.</p>
                                <p>The central grants in Switzerland always take the form of payments to the local authorities of a proportion of the teachers'
                                    salaries ; they are never, as in England, assessed upon the number of children in attendance, nor are they dependent, as was
                                    formerly the case in England, upon the results of examination, nor again are grants made in respect of particular subjects
                                    as is the case with the grants for special, i.e. practical, instruction in England.</p>
                                <p>Religious instruction in the Swiss communal schools generally follows the faith of the majority; in a few cantons separate
                                    schools being provided for minorities if sufficiently numerous. In the town of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucerne">Lucerne</name>, Catholic instruction is given in school hours, and Protestant
                                    instruction is provided out of school and out of hours for the Protestant minority.</p>
                                <p>In 19 out of the 25 cantons attendance at continuation schools is compulsory (at least in some districts) for boys up to 17,
                                    and in 3 cantons it is compulsory also wholly or in part for girls.</p>

                                    <item>I. The law of 1842 obliged the communes to provide primary instruction, which was to be free in the case of poor
                                        children. The state made grants in aid, subject to inspection. Subject to a conscience clause, religious instruction was
                                        obligatory, and was placed under ecclesiastical inspection.</item>
                                    <item>2. The law of 1879 removed religious instruction from the curriculum, and provided for facilities to the clergy to
                                        give such instruction outside school hours. This law furnishes a striking instance of the futility of a parliamentary
                                        majority legislating in a sense opposed to the convictions of a considerable section of the community. The law evoked a
                                        storm of opposition in the country, still profoundly Catholic and attached to ecclesiastical traditions, and within
                                        eighteen months the Catholics founded private elementary schools with 455,000 scholars. In 1883 the Catholic private
                                        schools numbered 622,000 scholars, whilst the attendance at the communal schools had sunk to 324,000. Their doctrinaire
                                        treatment of the education question resulted in the political annihilation of the Belgian Liberals, and was responsible
                                        for the strongest and most persistent Roman Catholic reaction that has been witnessed in western Europe since the
                                        beginning of the 19th century.</item>
                                    <item>3. The law of 1884 was the work of the moderate Catholic party. It did not make religious instruction obligatory, but
                                        it gave liberty to the communes to provide for the giving of religious and moral instruction at the beginning or end of
                                        school hours, subject to a conscience clause. Power was given to the communes to <q>" adopt "</q> private confessional
                                        schools and maintain them. Provision was further made entitling any twenty parents of children of school age to demand a
                                        school of the normal communal type, as against a proposal to adopt a confessional school. Power was also given to a like
                                        number of parents to compel the adoption of a confessional school in the case of the commune refusing to provide
                                        religious instruction of the type demanded by them, or putting obstacles in the way of its being given by the clergy or
                                        their representatives.</item>
                                    <item>4. The law of 1895 is the work of the more authoritarian Catholics, and makes religious instruction obligatory,
                                        placing it directly under the control of the clergy. It also increased the subsidies to private schools. This law was
                                        passed in face of opposition from the moderate section, who saw in it an exaltation of state authority which might be
                                        turned by opponents to the disadvantage of the religious interest.- It is by no means clear that Belgium has yet
                                        attained a final solution of the religious difficulty ; the life of the present law is probably to be measured by that
                                        of the Catholic political majority.</item>

                                <p>The outstanding feature of public education in Holland is the strength of the private primary schools. Under the law of 1857
                                    secular teaching alone was provided in the primary schools at the public cost. The law of 1878 allowed communes to make
                                    grants to private schools on condition of their becoming neutral in the matter of religion. The law of 1889 allowed private
                                    denominational schools to receive government grants while retaining their denominational character, but forbade further
                                    grants to such schools by the communes.</p>

                                    respectively; latterly also the special conditions obtaining in Wales have received partial recognition at the hands both of
                                    the legislature and the executive. In Scotland the conditions have been less complex than in England. The practical

                                    as an educational force in England, put fresh life into the educational aspirations of the people.

                                    by an act of 1803, which made better provision for teachers' salaries and also confirmed the position of the parish school
                                    as an adjunct of the parish church. The system of inspection and state aid introduced in England in 1839 was made applicable
                                    to Scotland, thus grafting upon Scotland the English system of voluntary state-aided schools. At the same period another new
                                    factor was imported into Scottish education by the ecclesiastical disruption of 1843. As a result of these changes in 1861 a

                                <p>The Education (Scotland) Act of 1872 set up elective school boards for parishes and boroughs, and vested in them the existing
                                    parish and burgh schools. Long prior to the act it had been the practice of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_Scotland">the Church of Scotland</name> to allow exemption in the schools
                                    from religious instruction ; consequently in imposing a compulsory conscience clause the act did little more than confirm
                                    existing usage. The school boards were left full liberty as to the religious instruction to be given in their schools, and
                                    in practice school boards universally adopt <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Shorter_Catechism">Westminster Shorter Catechism</title>, which is acceptable to all denominations of Presbyterians. The act made the
                                    school boards responsible for the supply of school accommodation, and introduced compulsory attendance, for which opinion in
                                    England was not at that time ripe. By the act of 1901, the age of compulsory attendance was raised to fourteen, with
                                    provision for exemption after twelve.</p>

                                    gradual abandonment of individual examination as the basis for the payment of grants. The institution of the merit
                                    certificate is one of the features in which the Scottish system differs from the English. Prior to the code of 1903 the
                                    merit certificate, awarded on examination after the age of twelve, was properly described as the leaving certificate of the
                                    elementary school. Under the more recent codes merit certificates are awarded under a system designed to encourage the
                                    transference of promising pupils at an early age to supplementary courses or higher-grade departments. Under this system the
                                    fitness of the pupil to enter upon a course of higher studies is determined not solely by the results of a single
                                    examination, but by the whole character of his work during the preceding school course.</p>

                                    modifying and strengthening the framework in various ways, but without introducing organic changes, <q>" Secondary "</q>

                                    the latter as providing at least a three years' course in languages, mathematics, science and such other subjects as may
                                    from time to time be deemed suitable for the instruction of pupils who have reached a certain standard of attainment in
                                    elementary subjects under the code. Intermediate and secondary schools may be provided and maintained either by school
                                    boards or otherwise, and provision is contained in the act for the transfer of endowed schools to the school board. Thus
                                    secondary (as well as elementary and continuative) education is organized upon the basis of the parish or burgh ; it
                                    receives, however, grants in aid through the agency of county (or large urban) authorities (called district committees)
                                    constituted under schemes of <name type="institution">the Scottish Education Department</name>. For the purpose of such

                                    laid before parliament and approved by the king in council. Out of the <q>" district education fund"</q> the school board
                                    receives (ordinarily) a sum equal to one-half of the amount by which the net cost to the school board (after deducting

                                <p>The full development of a system of public education in Ireland has been hampered and retarded by the general difficulties
                                    inherent in the problem of Irish government. In consequence of the fundamentally different social, religious and political
                                    conditions in the two countries, the English and Irish systems have developed down to the present time upon divergent lines.
                                    In England, popular education was founded in the first instance upon individual initiative combining in organized voluntary
                                    effort, and, though the voluntary agencies have been first supplemented and latterly to a large extent supplanted by public
                                    action, the tendency has been in the direction of municipalization rather than in that of central state control. In Ireland,
                                    on the other hand, education has suffered in the past from the general absence of individual initiative and local interest
                                    almost as seriously as from the mistakes of the English government. These causes, more directly perhaps than the prevailing
                                    poverty of the country, made it necessary to throw the burden of supporting the schools to an increasing extent upon the
                                    state, while the want of local self-government precluded any devolution of powers and duties upon municipal authorities.</p>

                                <p>State intervention is actually of earlier date in Ireland than in England. From the reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth</name> onwards, English Protestant schools were
                                    founded by the government in a sporadic and intermittent fashion in pursuance of its Anglicizing policy. To mention briefly
                                    one or two historical features, the great religious educational enterprise of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Ignatius_Rice">Edmond Rice</name> in founding the well-known <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers">Irish Catholic order of the
                                        Christian Brothers</name> in 1802 forms an exception to the general lack of initiative among the people themselves.
                                    About the same period <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kildare_Place_National_School">the Kildare
                                        Place Society</name> (founded in 1811 while the first commission of inquiry into Irish education was sitting) attempted
                                    to grapple with the peculiar difficulties of the religious situation upon lines somewhat similar to those just laid down by
                                        <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> and his followers in England.
                                    This organization comprised both Roman Catholic and Protestant schools upon a common religious basis of <title>Bible</title>
                                    reading without note or comment, and received government grants which rose to £30,000 a year before they were discontinued
                                    in 1833. The religious compromise which the system embodied broke down in consequence of Catholic dissatisfaction, and that
                                    it was at first fairly successful may seem extraordinary in view of the later attitude of the Catholic Church towards the
                                    question of common schools and combined religious instruction.</p>

                                <p>In 1833, as the result of a second commission of inquiry (1824) and a select committee of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name> (1828), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Smith-Stanley,_14th_Earl_of_Derby">Mr Stanley</name> inaugurated the national
                                    system of elementary schools under a board of commissioners nominated from the different religious denominations. The
                                    government appears from the outset to have aimed at combined secular and separate religious instruction for Roman Catholics
                                    and Protestants. At the same time, an attempt was inconsistently made to provide an ethical basis for the secular
                                    instruction by means of <title>Bible</title> extracts. The story of the preparation of these extracts by an ingenious
                                    compound of the Protestant Authorized and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douay-Rheims_Bible">Douai</title> versions
                                    of Scripture is in its way one of the curiosities of religious history. The extracts were designed to meet the recognized
                                    Catholic objection to the indiscriminate reading of <title>the Bible</title> without note or comment. In practice they were
                                    chiefly used in the Protestant schools (in which their use is now practically extinct), and the growing Catholic objection
                                    to the policy of <name type="institution">the National Board</name> in this respect found authoritative, though somewhat
                                    cautiously worded, expression in a decree of the Roman Congregation <ref>
                                        <title>De Propaganda Fide</title> of January 11,
                                        1846, declaring that non-sectarian religious instruction was dangerous to youth. <quote>

                                    difficulty in Irish elementary education may be said to have been solved in process of time by the conversion of the

                                    are only made to what are called vested schools, that is to say, schools of which the premises are vested in trustees or in
                                    the commissioners themselves. The state further pays in the case of all national schools the entire cost of maintenance
                                    except only the upkeep of the building, and the provision of books after the exhaustion of a first free grant.</p>

                                    <hi rend="italic">General Elementary-School Statistics.</hi>—In 1908 the average number of scholars on the rolls of all the
                                    schools was 708,992, and the average daily attendance was 494,662, or 69-8 % as compared with the number on the rolls. As
                                    regards religious denomination, 74-42 % of the scholars on the rolls were Roman Catholics; 28-6 % were in schools attended
                                    by both Roman Catholic and Protestant children and 71-4 % in schools attended solely by Roman Catholics or solely by
                                    Protestants. The total expenditure on the schools and teaching staffs was £1,591,214, of which £1,451,139, equivalent to £2,
                                    19s. 3d. per scholar, was contributed from state grants, and £140,074, equivalent to 5s. 9d. per scholar, from local (i.e.
                                    voluntary) sources, the rate per scholar from all sources being £3, 5s.</p>

                                    pupil teachers, are not explicitly recognized as forming part of the school staff. There are now seven training colleges,
                                    viz. one undenominational college maintained by the commissioners, five Roman Catholic colleges, and one college in

                                    of students in training was 1189, viz. 514 men and 675 women. The percentage of trained teachers to the total number of
                                    teachers was 64-7. A special training college for the instruction of teachers in Irish has been recognized.</p>

                                <p>One of the chief desiderata in Irish education is a single central authority for all branches of education, elementary,
                                    secondary (or <q>" intermediate "</q>) and technical. There are two <pb n="971" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0971.png"/> central authorities dealing with secondary
                                    education, viz. <name type="institution">the Intermediate Education Board</name> and <name type="institution">the Department
                                        for Agriculture and Technical Instruction</name>. The Intermediate Board administers sums available under <title>the
                                        Intermediate Education Act of 1878</title> from the Irish Church Surplus, and also the sum allocated under <title>the
                                        Local Taxation Act 1890</title>. The vice of the system in the opinion of educational experts lies in the statutory
                                    obligation to award grants on the result of an individual examination of the scholars. As a result of the vice-regal
                                    commission of 1898, power was taken to introduce a system of school inspection, though not to dispense with the individual
                                    examination as the basis for the award of the grants; this measure of reform was ultimately carried out in 1909. The sum
                                    distributed in result grants is about £50,000 per annum.</p>
                                <p>Prior to <title>the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899</title>, science and art grants were
                                    administered by <name type="institution">the Science and Art Department</name> in England ; by this act they were
                                    transferred to the new <name type="institution">Irish Department for Agriculture and Technical Instruction</name>. This
                                    department makes block grants to secondary schools in respect of science and art teaching, and manual instruction or
                                    domestic economy. Measures have been taken for the co-ordination of the duties of <name type="institution">the Technical
                                        Department</name> and <name type="institution">the Intermediate Board</name>, and the impetus given to the teaching of
                                    experimental science by grants for the erection of laboratories represents a reform of undoubted value for higher education
                                    in Ireland, especially when considered in connexion with the enlistment of the local interest of the technical education
                                    committees in the intermediate schools. Nevertheless, in the absence of a reform of the results system of intermediate
                                    grants, the special subsidizing of science teaching has tended to put an undue premium upon this subject to the detriment of
                                    the rest of the curriculum.</p>
                                <p>Ireland possesses no such system of scholarships for assisting the passage of scholars from the elementary to the secondary
                                    school as England enjoys as a result of the municipalization of the educational system. Nevertheless, Irish children as a
                                    fact pass much more freely from the elementary to the secondary school than is the case in England where social prejudices
                                    are stronger. The schools of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers">the Christian Brothers</name> are usually organized in two departments, primary and intermediate, and thus supply for
                                    the Roman Catholic population the demand for the cheap type of secondary day school represented by the municipal schools in
                                    England. It must be added that the Irish intermediate schools are purely denominational. The widespread demand for secondary
                                    education among the people, to which the report of Messrs <name type="person">Dale</name> and <name type="person">Stephens</name> bears witness, is a gratifying feature of Irish life, while the recent establishment (1908) of the
                                    long-deferred national university, and the perceptible quickening of intellectual interests throughout the country in
                                    connexion with the Celtic revival, point to better conditions for higher education and to the development of a wider, deeper
                                    and truer, because more national, culture.</p>

                                            for the education of the people in England is not the product of any theory or plan formulated beforehand by
                                            statesmen or philosophers; it has come into existence through a long course of experiments, compromises, traditions,

                                            resultant of many diverse forces and of slow evolution and growth rather than of pure purpose and well-defined

                                            by ancient universities and endowed foundations, by municipal and local effort, and only to a small extent by
                                            legislation. The genius—or rather characteristic habit—of the English people is averse from the philosophical
                                            system, and is disposed to regard education, not as a science, but as a body of expedients to be discovered

                                    of public education, as it results from successive acts of the administration and the legislature, is one which can only
                                    adequately be appreciated in the light of an historical survey of the various stages which have led up to it and the social
                                    conditions by which they were determined. The history of state education in England begins tardily in 1832, when after a
                                    generation of hesitation and controversy a beginning was made upon an exceedingly modest scale with the system of treasury
                                    grants in aid of elementary schools. The diverse forces which were at that date at work in the education of the nation as a
                                    whole, retarding state interference and marking out the limits within which it was long to be confined, derive their origin
                                    from a much remoter period.</p>

                                    contain the earliest germ of state interference. These laws obliged children between five and thirteen years of age who were
                                    found begging or idle to be bound apprentices to some handicraft. If the immediate object was the prevention of crime rather
                                    than education as such, this early legislation is at least significant of the primary and intimate connexion that exists
                                    between popular education and industrial and economic needs. Yet in the shaping of the educational system the original
                                    influences were religious rather than economic ; hence the importance of the canons of 1604, which secured the control of
                                    education to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established Church</name>.
                                    This of course was no novel doctrine, but merely the reaffirmation by the Reformed Church of the Catholic tradition of
                                    religious exclusiveness, presenting itself to the mind of contemporaries rather as the recognition of a national, that was
                                    also a religious, duty than as the assumption of an ecclesiastical privilege. Whatever mischief the Tudor statesmen wrought

                                    new religion branded as superstitious, however far the English Reformation fell short of the organized enthusiasm for
                                    popular education and culture that marked the first most vigorous and constructive period of Lutheranism in Germany, the
                                    Protestant, and especially the Puritan, spirit unquestionably inspired a considerable volume of individual educational
                                    effort during the latter half of the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries. Here, as in Germany, the influence of
                                    the Reformation was wholly on the side of classicism, the dead languages being the key to the theological learning which was
                                    of primary concern to the men of that theological age. The conception of elementary education as a system complete in itself
                                    and adapted to the needs of the masses of the people was unfamiliar at this date. The earliest elementary schools were
                                        <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                    preparatory departments of the grammar-schools. Education in fact was still regarded as the privilege of an elite, but, as
                                    in the middle ages, the elite for whom it was sought to provide a ladder to the university by means of the endowed schools
                                    so numerously founded about this time was an elite of intellect and not of mere wealth; the class feeling which became so
                                    marked a feature of English higher education was of much later growth.</p>

                                <p>Towards the end of the 17th century elementary education began to differentiate itself, partly by way of reaction against the
                                    unnatural classicism of the preceding age, but more especially as the result of the growth of towns and the creation of a
                                    considerable industrial population. At the close of the century the moral evils attendant upon industrialism alarmed the
                                    religious conscience and prompted one of the great educational movements that stand to the credit of the national church. In
                                    1699 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Bray">Dr Bray</name> founded <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge">the Society for the Promotion of Christian

                                        Coat"</q> schools scattered plentifully throughout the country and especially in the great centres of population. The
                                    foundation of these schools, which was pushed forward with vigour during the early years of the 18th century, represents an
                                    energetic and wellplanned attempt to cope with the social evil of poverty by educational means. The instruction was
                                    elementary, the scholars were clothed as well as taught free, and the schools in the first instance were supported not so
                                    much by permanent endowment <pb n="972" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0972.png"/> as by voluntary effort, so that with this movement the voluntary system may be
                                    said to make its appearance. Lastly, all these philanthropic efforts were inspired by a solid but sober piety nurtured by a
                                    church which came nearer than at any other period of its history to enjoying the undivided allegiance of the people. Another

                                    of elementary education in a small way upon less specifically religious lines. Numerous small endowments for the elementary
                                    education of poor children were provided by well-to-do parishioners ; indeed to such an extent did the practice of making

                                    inheritance by reviving the law of mortmain in an act of 1736. The village schoolmaster became a feature of rural life,
                                    frequently enjoying a schoolhouse provided sometimes by endowment and sometimes even directly by the parishioners at the
                                    cost of the rate levied by the vestry, but more often aided only by a little stipend from an endowment for teaching poor
                                    children, and eking out an always scanty subsistence by the fees of such paying scholars as he could succeed in getting

                                    centuries respectively. Nevertheless, in virtue of his achievement in organization, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Raikes">Raikes</name> is rightly regarded as the founder of the English Sunday
                                    school. The peculiar value of the Sunday-school system in its early days lay in the combination of secular with religious
                                    instruction ; in many cases the school was held on Saturday as well as Sunday, and its restriction to the one day or two
                                    days was due to the prevalence of child labour under stress of the great industrial expansion. With better economic
                                    conditions and with the development of day schools the Sunday schools gradually became restricted in function to purely
                                    religious instruction. Even with this limitation there is no doubt that the great Sunday-school organizations of the various
                                    churches still deserve to be reckoned among the educational assets of the nation, and as agencies both of religious
                                    instruction and of general culture they may tend, under modern educational and religious developments, to play an
                                    increasingly important part.</p>

                                <p>At the end of the 18th century the development of industry and the social unrest which followed the French Revolution
                                    combined to bring home to the public mind the need of a national system of day schools. Unfortunately, just at this moment
                                    the revival of Nonconformity as the result of the religious vitality of the Evangelical movement shattered the religious
                                    peace of the early Hanoverian period and divided the nation once more into hostile camps, to which class distinctions lent
                                    additional bitterness. The famous controversy between <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)">Andrew Bell</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Joseph Lancaster</name> and their respective followers in the opening
                                    years of the 19th centuiy served to define the religious difficulty substantially in the form in which it exists after the
                                    lapse of a century for the present generation. Both these remarkable men conceived independently the idea of a national
                                    system of popular education upon a voluntary basis; both concurred in extolling the merits of the monitorial system, which
                                    each claimed to have originated. The controversy between them, begun upon personal grounds, resolved itself into a national
                                    contest of rival principles of religious teaching. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> as a young Quaker schoolmaster, confronted with pupils drawn from various religious bodies, planned
                                    his religious instruction upon the lines of doctrine common to all the orthodox Christian denominations. Thus he is the
                                    father of the undenominational religious teaching which later formed the basis of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise. But
                                    whereas <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> is purely negative in form and so seems to point to an undogmatic religion,
                                    the Lancasterian teaching was essentially positive and dogmatic within its limits. In 1805 <bibl>

                                    following not merely upon the question of the exclusion of dogmatic formularies, but also upon the question of the control
                                    of whatever religious teaching should be given. In fact the vital question at this period was whether the clergy of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established Church</name> were to control the
                                    national education. The religious issue was prominent in connexion with the remarkable attempt at legislation made by the

                                    idea of utilizing the older pupils to teach the younger presented itself independently to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Borough_Road">the Borough Road</name> and to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)">Bell</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chennai">Madras</name>. The monitorial plan never rested upon any educational theory;
                                    it was simply a makeshift, a rough-and-ready expedient for overcoming the practical difficulty caused by the dearth of
                                    competent teachers. Historically it is important as the precursor of the pupil-teacher system which so long formed the

                                    endowed charities. The labours of this great inquisition lasted for twenty years and led <pb n="973" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0973.png"/> to the reformation of
                                    many cases of abuse or waste of wealthy endowments, and eventually to the establishment of <name type="institution">the

                                    government by means of an order in council established a separate education office under the style of <name type="institution">the Committee of Council on Education</name>, and the sum voted by parliament was increased to
                                    £39,000. The original intention of the government was to establish a state normal school or training college as the
                                    foundation of a national system of education. Unfortunately this design had to be abandoned in view of the religious
                                    difficulty, with the result (so fruitful in controversy at the present time) that the training of elementary teachers was
                                    left in private hands and became a stronghold of the voluntary and denominational interests. In view of the limited
                                    resources placed at their disposal by parliament, <name type="institution">the Committee of Council</name> were at first
                                    compelled to confine their assistance to capital grants in aid of the provision of school buildings, but in the distribution
                                    of the money three important conditions were at once imposed. In the first place, the continuing right of inspection was
                                    required in all cases ; secondly, promoters were obliged to conform to a fixed standard of structural efficiency; thirdly,
                                    the building must be settled upon trusts permanently securing it to the education of poor children.</p>

                                    concurrence of the archbishop of the province, and, what seems still more extraordinary to modern ideas, any such
                                    appointment was to be revoked should the archbishop at any time withdraw his concurrence. The inspectors were charged with
                                    the duty of inspecting religious teaching, but under instructions to be framed by the archbishop, and their reports were to
                                    be transmitted in duplicate to the archbishop and the bishop for the information of these authorities. Further, the general
                                    instructions of <name type="institution">the Committee of Council</name> themselves were to be communicated to the
                                    archbishop before being finally sanctioned. The march of events, and in particular the altered financial relations between
                                    the state and the voluntary managers brought about by the institution of maintenance grants, soon rendered this concordat
                                    obsolete, but it remains historically important as showing how at the outset the denominational principle was recognized and
                                    fostered by the state.</p>

                                <p>Among the first acts of <name type="institution">the Committee of Council</name> was the promulgation of a set of model trust
                                    deeds, one or other of which applicants for building grants were required to adopt for the settlement of their school
                                    premises. The necessary conditions were the permanent appropriation of the site to purposes of education, and the permanent
                                    right of government inspection; it must, however, be noted that this latter right was generally limited in terms to the
                                    inspection provided for by the minute of August 10, 1840. A conscience clause was not obligatory, and indeed was only
                                    offered in the limited form of exemption from instruction in formularies and attendance at Sunday school or public worship.
                                    A more systematic attempt to promote public control by means of trust deeds in 1846 led <name type="institution">the
                                        Committee of Council</name> into a controversy with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Society_for_Promoting_Religious_Education">the National Society</name> which
                                    extended over a period of three years, turning chiefly upon the management clauses and the question of appeals, and
                                    resulting in compromises which constituted a fresh concordat with the church. In point of fact, the management clauses
                                    proved to be of little practical consequence, save in a few controversial cases, until <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>, which had the effect of bringing them once
                                    more into prominence in connexion with the constitution of statutory bodies of foundation managers. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act of 1902</title> also dealt specifically with two other
                                    points arising upon the old trust deeds, viz. the control of religious instruction and the appeal to the bishop in religious
                                    questions. Special facilities for the conveyance of land for school purposes were afforded to limited owners by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School_Sites_Act_1841">the School Sites Acts of 1841</title> and subsequent years. The
                                    landed gentry responded with great public spirit to the call thus made upon their generosity by the state, with the result
                                    that the vast majority of rural, and many urban, parishes were freely endowed with sites for elementary schools.</p>

                                <p>In 1846 an important step forwards was taken in the foundation of the pupil-teacher system. The regulations of this year
                                    inaugurated annual maintenance grants in the form of stipends for apprenticed pupil teachers receiving a prescribed course
                                    of instruction under the head teacher, and a lower grade of stipendiary monitors in schools where such instruction could not
                                    be provided. These regulations inaugurated the system of Queen's Scholarships to assist pupil teachers to proceed to a
                                    training college ; they also established capitation grants for the support of such colleges, and annual grants to elementary
                                    schools under government inspection of from £15 to £30 in aid of the salary of every trained teacher employed. Provision was
                                    at the same time made for retiring pensions to elementary teachers.</p>

                                    and were renewed in a series of bills from 1853 to 1857, of which one set was introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell">Lord John Russell</name> on behalf of the Whig
                                    government, whilst a second was promoted by an organization called <name type="institution">the Manchester and Salford
                                        Committee on Education</name>, in the denominational interest, and a third set by an organization called <name type="institution">the Lancashire (afterwards the National) Public Schools Association</name>, in the secular interest.

                                    for elementary education was supplemented by an administrative system of capitation grants for rural areas. The government

                                    to assist existing voluntary schools out of the rates. No provision was made for public control beyond the requirement of
                                    audit; the sole condition as to religious instruction was the acceptance of a conscience clause.</p>

                                <p>The failure of <title>the Borough Bill</title> did not affect the new system of capitation grants which was introduced by
                                    minute of <name type="institution">the Committee of Council</name> dated April 2, 1853. These grants were fixed at a scale
                                    varying from 3s. to 6s. per head, payable upon certain conditions, of which the most important were that the school must be
                                    under a certificated teacher, and that three-fourths of the children must pass a prescribed examination. In consequence of
                                    the failure of the several fresh bills introduced in 1855 by the government, the church party and the secular party
                                    respectively amplifying the proposals previously brought forward, the capitation grant was, by minute of January 26, 1856,
                                    extended to urban areas. As in the case of all the early grants, the regulations governing the distribution of the
                                    capitation grants were framed upon the principle that subventions of public money must be met by local funds derived from
                                    voluntary contributions, endowments and school fees; thus the basis of the denominational system as fostered by the state at
                                    this stage was one of financial partnership.</p>

                                <p>The progress of state-aided education during this period may be measured by the increase of the annual parliamentary grant,
                                    which rose from £30,000 in 1839 to £100,000 in 1846, £I50,000 in 1851, £396,000 in 1855, and £663,400 in l858. This
                                    expansion was viewed with misgiving by the friends of the denominational system, and by the strong individualist school of
                                    that day, who upon wider grounds clung to the old ideal of voluntary initiative. These sections combined with the advocates
                                    of further state intervention to press for a commission of inquiry, and at the instance of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John Pakington</name> (the eminent Conservative
                                    educationist who was responsible for the denominational bills of the fifties) a royal commission was appointed in 1858,
                                    under the chairmanship of the duke of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">Newcastle</name>, to inquire into the state of popular education in England, and to consider and report what measures,
                                    if any, were required for the extension of sound and cheap elementary instruction to all classes of the people. <title>The
                                        Report of the Newcastle Commission</title>, issued in 1861, contains an exhaustive account of the existing condition of
                                    elementary education, and, with due allowance for the grave defects revealed, and in particular the glaring inefficiency of
                                    the numerous little private-venture schools kept by <q>" dames"</q> and others, the graphic picture drawn by the
                                    commissioners constitutes a striking tribute to the sterling qualities of self-help and religious earnestness which were so
                                    characteristic of the early Victorian period. It was found that in round numbers about 2,500,000 children were attending day
                                    schools, the proportion to population being 1 in 7, as compared with 1 in 9 in France, 1 in 8 in Holland, and 1 in 6 in
                                    Prussia, where education was compulsory. On the other hand, of this number only 1,675,000 were in public schools of all
                                    kinds, only 1,100,000 in schools liable to inspection, and 917,000 in schools receiving annual grant. The result was that
                                    only one child in every twenty was attending a school whose efficiency could be in any way guaranteed by the state. In the
                                    constructive portion of their work the comments and recommendations of the commissioners reflected the prevailing perplexity
                                    of the public mind. A consistent individualistic minority considered that the annual grant should be withdrawn altogether,
                                    and that any further state aid should be confined to building grants, which they would concede not as desirable in
                                    themselves but as necessitated out of considerations of fairness to the parishes that had not yet received such aid. The
                                    commissioners as a body rejected free and compulsory education in view of the religious difficulty and upon general grounds
                                    of individualistic principle. Of the religious difficulty itself the commissioners had some wise words to say which hold
                                    good in substance at the present time. In their judgment the considerable evidence they had amassed conclusively proved that
                                    the religious difficulty originated with the managers, promoters and organizers of the schools, and not with the parents
                                    themselves ; yet the indifferent or comparatively passive attitude of the people nowise materially diminished the practical
                                    difficulty of introducing a comprehensive system, since it was not with the body of the people but with the founders and
                                    supporters of schools that legislators would always have to deal. In view of the solution adopted in 1902 it is of interest
                                    to note that the Newcastle Commissioners deliberately rejected the parish as unfit to be taken as the unit of elementary
                                    education upon the ground that management by parochial ratepayers must tend to be illiberal and niggardly, bent upon economy
                                    of the rates to the detriment of educational interests; accordingly they recommended the constitution of county boards
                                    (which in the absence of elective councils must needs originate with quarter sessions) clothed with power to levy a rate for
                                    the aid of existing voluntary schools.</p>

                                <p>The one definite achievement of <name type="institution">the Newcastle Commission</name> was the famous system of payment by
                                    results, which may be said to have excited a keener and more prolonged controversy than any other measure of a purely
                                    educational character. Impressed by the defects of the existing teaching, the commissioners reported that there was only one
                                    way of securing efficiency, and that was to institute a searching examination by competent authority of every child in every
                                    school to which grants were to be paid, with the view of ascertaining whether the indispensable elements of knowledge were
                                    thoroughly acquired, and to make the prospects and position of the teacher dependent to a considerable extent upon the
                                    results of this examination. Thus the commissioners hoped to counteract what appeared to them to be the crying defect of the
                                    existing training college system, viz. that it tended mainly to adapt the young schoolmaster to advance his higher, rather
                                    than to thoroughly ground his junior, pupils. They recognized that to raise the character of the children, both morally and
                                    intellectually, was and must always be the highest aim of education, and they were far from desiring to supersede this by
                                    any plan of a mere examination into the more mechanical <pb n="975" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0975.png"/> work of elementary education, the reading, writing and
                                    arithmetic of young children; but they thought that the importance of this training, which must be the foundation of all
                                    other teaching, had been lost sight of, and that there was justice in the common complaint that while a fourth of the
                                    scholars were really taught, three-fourths after leaving school forgot everything they had learnt there.</p>

                                    managers, and even as a breach of faith with the great religious denominations. On purely educational grounds, which need
                                    not be here recapitulated, it was at once viewed with misgiving by many authorities, including <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Matthew_Arnold">Matthew Arnold</name>. To meet objections, some modifications were
                                    introduced in the code under the Conservative government in 1867. The system of paying grant upon the result of individual
                                    examination of the scholars was not finally abolished till 1904.</p>

                                <p>The years immediately preceding 1870 were occupied with discussion and preparation for the great legislative measure for
                                    which the time was now felt to have arrived. Good work was done in this direction by the Select Committee of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name> in 1866, over which
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John Pakington</name>
                                    presided. For reasons connected with the political situation of the moment this committee never reported, but the minutes of
                                    evidence and the draft report prepared by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John Pakington</name> contained much valuable
                                    material in the way of criticism of the existing system and suggestion for the coming settlement; in particular the draft
                                    report insisted upon the inevitableness of an education rate. In 1868 the Conservative government brought in, but did not
                                    proceed with, an education bill deliberately discarding the principle of rate-aid on the ground that it would destroy
                                    voluntary contributions and gradually starve out the denominational schools. In 1867 and again in 1868 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bruce,_1st_Baron_Aberdare">Mr Bruce (afterwards Lord Aberdare)</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Edward_Forster">Mr W.E.

                                    of the measure of 1870. As redrafted in 1868 the bill of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bruce,_1st_Baron_Aberdare">Mr Bruce</name> and his coadjutors proposed a
                                    universal system of municipal and parochial rating with liberty for voluntary schools to unite themselves to the rate-aided
                                    system under their existing management, subject to the acceptance of a conscience clause. The bill also proposed to empower
                                    town councils to co-opt outsiders upon their education committees. Thus both in the principle of co-optation and in the
                                    extension of rate-aid to schools not under public control the bill of these Liberal statesmen in 1868 anticipated certain

                                    every respect the marks of compromise. As <ref>
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Edward_Forster">Mr Forster</name> explained in introducing the bill, the object of the government was <quote>" to complete the
                                            voluntary system and to fill up gaps,"</quote>
                                    </ref> not to supplant it. To this end <name type="institution">the
                                        Education Department</name> was charged with the duty of ascertaining whether or not there was in every parish a
                                    deficiency of public school accommodation, and provision made for the formation of school boards in every school district
                                    (i.e. parish or municipal borough) requiring further public school accommodation. Such accommodation might consist either of
                                    public elementary schools as defined by the act, or other schools giving efficient and suitable elementary education. The
                                    definition of public elementary school contained in section 7 of the act is still in force. Shortly, a public elementary
                                    school is a school subject to a conscience clause entitling scholars to complete exemption from all religious instruction
                                    and observance whatsoever. Any religious instruction or observance in the school must be either at the beginning or the end
                                    of the school meeting. The school must also be open at all times to the government inspectors and must be conducted in
                                    accordance with the conditions required to be fulfilled in order to obtain an annual parliamentary grant. In the same
                                    connexion an important change was made in the conditions of inspection by declaring that it should be no part of the duties
                                    of the inspector to inquire into religious instruction, whilst a later section of the act provided that no parliamentary
                                    grant should be made in respect of any religious instruction.</p>
                                <p>Three important changes were made in the measure during its passage through parliament. As at first proposed, <list>
                                        <item>(1) the school boards were not to be directly elected by the ratepayers, but were to be appointed by the town
                                            council or the vestry.</item>
                                        <item>(2) These nominated boards were empowered either to provide schools themselves or to assist existing public
                                            elementary schools, provided that such assistance was granted on equal terms to all such schools, upon conditions to
                                            be approved by <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>. Thus the school board, if it exercised the
                                            option of assisting denominational schools, would have been obliged to assist all or none.</item>
                                        <item>(3) With regard to its own schools, the school board was to settle the form of religious instruction.</item>
                                    </list> These proposals raised serious opposition in the country, and when the committee stage of the bill was reached two
                                    fundamental changes were made in the policy of the bill. In the first place, as <ref>
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Gladstone">Mr Gladstone</name> put it, the government had decided <quote>"
                                            to sever altogether the tie between the local board and the voluntary schools."</quote>
                                    </ref> In lieu of the
                                    suggested rate-aid they proposed an increased grant from <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury">the treasury</name>, that is to say, the voluntary schools were left
                                    standing as state-aided schools under private management, side by side with the new rate-supported schools.</p>

                                <p>Next, the character of the religious instruction in the board schools was determined upon an undenominational basis by a
                                    provision which has become known to history after the name of its author, then <ref>
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Mr Cowper-Temple</name>, as
                                            <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> (section 14 of the act), directing that <quote>"no religious catechism or
                                            religious formulary which is distinctive of any particular denomination shall be taught in the
                                        school."</quote>
                                    </ref> The clause was not intended to exclude doctrinal exposition, and was in fact a compromise not
                                    merely between absolute secularism and denominationalism, but between denominationalism and the view of those who would have
                                        <title>the Bible</title> read without note or comment. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apostles'_Creed">The

                                    excluded under <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title>. The result was the establishment in the schools, upon the lines laid

                                    the 19th century, of what may be termed the common Protestantism of the English nation ; and though <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Mr Disraeli</name> urged that a religion without formularies was in
                                    fact a new religion, and that in leaving its exposition to the teachers we were creating a new sacerdotal class, the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name>
                                    compromise, notwithstanding its inherent want of logic, stood the test of experience for more than a generation against the
                                    consistent denominationalists on the one hand and the party of secular education on the other. It is important to observe
                                    that the act of 1870 left the giving of <pb n="976" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0976.png"/> religious instruction, whether in voluntary schools (in which its
                                    inclusion might be assumed as of course) or in board schools, purely permissive. In practice it was only in Wales that
                                    school boards availed themselves to any extent of the liberty to abstain from giving religious instruction, and this
                                    comparative secularism of Wales certainly argued no lack of religious life among the people.</p>
                                <p>The third change in the bill was the substitution of the ad hoc school board for the municipally appointed board originally
                                    proposed, a change which commended itself in view of the special difficulty presented by the case of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name>. These boards were elected by the system of cumulative voting
                                    under which each elector had as many votes as there were candidates to be elected, with liberty to give all his votes to one
                                    candidate or to distribute them amongst the candidates as he thought fit. This system was much criticized as being unduly
                                    favourable to minorities, whose representation it was devised to secure ; it continued, however, until the supersession of
                                    the <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                        <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>
                                    </foreign> authorities by committees of the county and urban
                                    councils under <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>.</p>
                                <p>School boards were empowered not only to acquire sites for schools under powers of compulsory purchase, but also to take
                                    transfers of existing voluntary schools from their managers. The section which enables managers to transfer schools to the
                                    school board or local education authority for the purpose of board or council schools freed from religious trusts
                                    unquestionably marks an important inroad by the state upon the sanctity of trusts. Thus though the act of 1870 did not
                                    itself introduce the principle of compulsory transfer, it formed the point of departure for the proposals in this direction
                                    which were the basis of the unsuccessful bills of 1906 and 1908. The act of 1870 did not introduce either direct compulsory
                                    attendance or free education, but it took a distinct step forward in each direction by enabling school boards to frame
                                    by-laws rendering attendance compulsory, and also to pay the school fees in the case of poverty of the parent.</p>
                                <p>The policy of compromise between the two systems of voluntary and rate-established schools was carried out in the provisions
                                    relating to the future supply of schools. On the one hand, building grants were continued temporarily for the benefit of
                                    those who applied (as voluntary managers alone could apply) before the 31st of December 1870. On the other hand, <name type="institution">the Education Department</name> was authorized to refuse parliamentary grants to schools established
                                    in school board districts after the passing of the act if they thought such schools unnecessary.</p>

                                <p>The following figures are of interest as showing the progress made under the act of 1870. In the year 1870 there was
                                    accommodation in inspected day schools for about 2,000,000 children ; the average attendance was 1,168,000, and the number
                                    on the books about 1,500,000. It was computed, however, that there were, exclusive of the well-to-do classes, at least
                                    1,500,000 children who attended no school at all or schools not under inspection. In 1876 accommodation had been provided
                                    for nearly 3,500,000, and of the 1,500,000 new places nearly two-thirds were provided by voluntary agencies. <ref>
                                        <quote>"
                                            These voluntary agencies," says <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_Henry_Craik,_1st_Baronet">Sir H. Craik</name>, " had received grants in aid for about one-third of the schools they had built, the grants
                                            defraying about one-fifth of the cost of the aided schools."</quote>
                                    </ref> On the other hand, the growth of school
                                    boards was rapid and continuous, notwithstanding the permissive character of the act and the strenuous efforts of the
                                    voluntaryists to keep pace with the new demands. In 1872, 9,700,000 of the population were under school boards, and of these
                                    8,142,000 were under by-laws; in 1876 the numbers were respectively 12,500,000 and 10,400,000. In the same period the annual
                                    grants increased from £894,000 in 1870 to £1,600,000 in 1876.</p>

                                <p>The development evidenced by the above figures, and in particular the fact that 52 % of the population were subject to
                                    by-laws, enabled <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Mr Disraeli</name>'s government in
                                    1876 to take a notable step forward in the direction of universal direct compulsion. The act of 1876 embodied the
                                    declaration that <quote>" it shall be the duty of the parent of every child to cause such child to receive efficient
                                        elementary instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic, and if such parent fail to perform such duty he shall be
                                        liable to such orders and penalties as are provided by the Act "</quote> ; next, it rendered an employer liable to a
                                    penalty who took into his employment a child under the age of ten years, or a child between the ages of ten and fourteen
                                    years who had not obtained the required certificate of proficiency in reading, writing and arithmetic, or of previous
                                    attendance at a certified efficient school. In order to complete the machinery for compulsion, the act directed that, in
                                    every district where there was no school board, a school attendance committee should be appointed by the local authority.
                                    The law as to school attendance, resting upon this and subsequent enactments, is complicated and in some details obscure.
                                    The subject was dealt with in the report of an inter-departmental committee in 1900, who recommended the abolition of the

                                    passed a short act which made the framing of by-laws compulsory upon school boards and school attendance committees, thus
                                    completing the system of universal direct compulsion. Under the acts of 1876 and 1880 the average attendance increased from
                                    2,000,000 in 1876 to 3,500,000 in 1878 and 4,000,000 in 1881 ; in terms of percentage to population, 8-06 in 1876, 9-60 in
                                    1878, and 10-69 in 1881. In the last-mentioned year the annual grant rose to £2,200,000, having more than doubled in the

                                <p>With the passing of <title>the Elementary Education Act 1880</title> the education question entered upon a new phase. The
                                    country was now possessed of a national system of elementary education, in the sense that provision was made for the supply
                                    of efficient schools and for compulsory attendance. The question of free education was brought within the range of practical
                                    politics by the adoption of universal compulsion, but as yet it was advocated only by a small political group of pronounced
                                    collectivist tendencies. Whilst opinion was maturing on this topic, there began to force itself upon the public mind the
                                    vastly more difficult problem of combining the two systems of voluntary, denominational, state-aided schools on the one
                                    hand, and public, undenominational, rate-supported schools on the other. From the denominational point of view the problem
                                    presented itself as that of a burden imposed and a danger threatened in ever-increasing degree by the competition of the
                                    board schools, a competition that was felt not so much by direct rivalry of school with school as indirectly by the steady
                                    raising of the standard of efficiency with respect to buildings, equipment, salaries of teachers and educational attainment
                                    which inevitably resulted from the establishment of authorities with power to draw upon the rates. On the other hand, from
                                    the purely educational point of view, it was seen that the dual system tended in practice to an illicit but almost
                                    inevitable recognition of two standards of efficiency, the lower being conceded to voluntary schools in consideration of
                                    their comparative poverty. Experience, too, of the shortcomings of small country school boards was beginning to confirm the
                                    misgivings entertained long before by the Newcastle Commissioners as to the wisdom of entrusting autonomous powers to the
                                    parish, when the reform of local government by the creation of popularly elected county authorities turned attention once
                                    more to the question of organizing education upon a county basis.</p>

                                <p>In 1887 a royal commission under the presidency of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._A._Cross,_1st_Viscount_Cross">Viscount Cross</name> was appointed to inquire into
                                    the working of the education acts. The labours of this commission produced a thorough discussion of the educational problem
                                    in all its aspects, political, administrative, scholastic and religious. For any clear recommendations with regard to the
                                    reorganization of education generally the moment was not opportune, inasmuch as the commission just preceded the
                                    establishment of the new county authorities and the powers with respect to instruction other than elementary which
                                    parliament was shortly to confide to them under <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>. Nevertheless the report of
                                    the majority of the <pb n="977" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0977.png"/> commissioners pointed unmistakably towards the solution adopted in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>, and their definite recommendation that
                                    voluntary schools should be accorded rate-aid without the imposition of <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title>, served as
                                    the basis of that legislation. The commission brought into strong relief the opposing currents of thought in educational
                                    politics, the majority report, representing the principles of denominationalism, being balanced by a strong minority report
                                    embodying the views of those who looked for progress along the lines of the school-board system. Taken together, the two
                                    reports form a comprehensive survey of the difficulties which still in the main beset public education in this country.</p>

                                    practical establishment of free education by the act of l891 not by the absolute prohibition of school fees but by the
                                    device of a special grant payable by parliament in lieu of fees, called the fee grant. The result of this legislation and of
                                    subsequent administrative action was to place free education within the reach of every child, fees being retained (with few
                                    exceptions) only where some instruction of a higher elementary type was given.</p>

                                        Government Act 1888</title> introduced a new factor which was destined to exert a determining influence upon subsequent
                                    developments of public education. In the first place, it at once rendered possible the partial and experimental provision
                                    for higher education attempted by <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>, which affected secondary education as well

                                    period, it is necessary to refer back to the first attempts made to deal with secondary education a generation earlier.</p>

                                    royal commission, presided over by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Villiers,_4th_Earl_of_Clarendon">Lord Clarendon</name>, to inquire into the
                                    condition of nine of the chief endowed schools in the country, viz. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eton_College">Eton</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winchester_College">Winchester</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_School">Westminster</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charterhouse_School">Charterhouse</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_Paul's_School_(London)">St Paul's</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Merchant_Taylors'_School,_Northwood">Merchant Taylors</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harrow_School">Harrow</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rugby_School">Rugby</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shrewsbury_School">Shrewsbury</name>. The report of this commission led to a statute,

                                    remains the best introduction to the problem of public secondary education in England. The existence of numerous and
                                    frequently very wealthy endowments arising from private benefactions and bequests has at all times been a feature in
                                    education as in other departments of English social life. In the organization of secondary education in particular, private
                                    endowments have played and continue still to play a part which cannot be paralleled in any other country. This circumstance
                                    has undoubtedly resulted in a great economy of resources, though in numerous instances the difficulties occasioned by the
                                    haphazard distribution of endowments and the local jealousies invariably aroused by any attempt to readjust their areas to
                                    modern conditions have obstructed useful reform and proved a source of misdirected and wasted effort. At the date of <name type="institution">the Schools Inquiry Commission</name> the state of the ancient endowments was largely one of abuse.
                                    Very many endowments intended for advanced education were applied for instruction of a purely elementary character, and that
                                    of an inferior kind ; indeed the possession of an endowment in a rural locality not infrequently operated to prevent the
                                    establishment of an efficient state-aided school. The evidence showed that the proportion of scholars in the country
                                    grammar-schools who were receiving some tincture of the classical education intended by the founders was steadily
                                    decreasing, and nothing had been done to bring the curriculum into harmony with the actual needs of the time. No doubt a
                                    small elite of classical scholars were sent to the older universities by these schools, but in the main they were in a
                                    feeble and decadent state, giving, more or less inefficiently, an education wholly unsuited to the wants of the class to
                                    whom they ministered. In addition to the general inelasticity of the curriculum, the special evils from which the
                                    grammar-schools suffered were the want of effective governing bodies and the freehold tenure of the headmasterships.</p>

                                    modifications of importance and general interest into the law of trusts. Under the existing rules of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Chancery">the court of chancery</name>, which rules were
                                    also binding upon the Charity Commissioners, educational endowments were generally treated, in the absence of evidence to
                                    the contrary, as subject to a trust for instruction in the doctrines of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Church of England</name>. Under <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools Acts</title> the presumption is reversed,
                                    and ancient trusts are treated as free from denominational restrictions, save in virtue of express conditions imposed by or
                                    under the authority of the founder. The result was that in framing schemes for the reorganization of ancient endowed schools
                                    the commissioners found themselves able to treat the majority of cases as undenominational. In such cases the general
                                    practice was to direct that instruction should, subject to a strict conscience clause, be given in the principles of the
                                    Christian faith; this provision corresponded in a way to <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> in elementary education,
                                    with the important distinction that it was positive, not negative, and did not exclude special doctrinal instruction.</p>

                                        <item>(2) a local or provincial authority, representing the county or a group of counties, with a certain jurisdiction
                                            both in proposing schemes for the reform of endowed schools in their area (such as that afterwards conferred upon
                                            the joint education committees under <name type="institution">the Welsh Intermediate Education Act</name>), and in

                                    </list>. Further, it was proposed to raise the level of proprietary and private schools by offering them inspection and
                                    examination and by establishing a system of school registration. Lastly, in order that the supply of public secondary
                                    schools might not be dependent upon endowments, it was proposed to confer upon towns and parishes powers of rating for the
                                    establishment of new schools. For these proposals as a whole the time was not ripe. The bill of 1869 as originally

                                    attempted to give effect, with some variations, <pb n="978" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0978.png"/> to one of these suggestions, namely, that for the creation of
                                    a central council, but exigencies of parliamentary time made it necessary to drop this part of the measure ; the result was
                                    that the plan of the commissioners was only half carried out. Nevertheless, owing to the multiplicity and wealth of
                                    endowments, the work accomplished was sufficient to exert a considerable influence upon the secondary education of the

                                    and popular county authorities of which the need had been felt by reformers alike in secondary and elementary education,
                                    rendered the first step in the direction of the municipalization of secondary instruction at last possible. In 1889
                                        <title>the Technical Instruction Act</title> (extended in some particulars by an act of 1891) empowered the councils of
                                    counties, boroughs and urban districts to levy a rate (not exceeding a penny in the pound) for the support or aid of
                                    technical or manual instruction. Comparatively few councils were prepared to resort to their rating powers, but progress
                                    under these acts was greatly facilitated by <title>the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act of 1890</title>, which
                                    mentioned technical instruction as one of the purposes to which the imperial contribution paid to local authorities in
                                    respect of the beer and spirit duties might be applied. By virtue of the very liberal interpretation given to technical
                                    instruction by these acts the financial assistance afforded under them was extended to cover the whole field of mathematical
                                    and physical science, as well as modern languages.</p>

                                    century by the rise of the new university colleges, among which must be reckoned those established expressly for women. In

                                <p>At the same time, the pressure of the school boards influenced secondary education in two ways. In the first place, the
                                    elementary schools were found to act as feeders for schools of a higher type, and the idea of the <q>" educational ladder
                                        "</q> began to play a leading part in plans for the organization of national education. It was seen that there must be
                                    schools to which the more advanced scholars could pass from the public elementary schools, and scholarships to assist such
                                    scholars to continue their education in this way. In the next place, it was recognized that to provide adequately for the
                                    further education of public elementary scholars a new type of school was required. Thus there came into being through the
                                    initiative of the great school boards what were known as higher-grade elementary schools. These were really secondary
                                    schools of the third grade, and, as <name type="institution">the Commission on Secondary Education</name> observed, the
                                    school boards simply stepped in to fill the educational void which the Schools Inquiry Commissioners had proposed to fill by
                                    schools of that name. The happy obscurity of the legal definition of elementary education left these schools free to develop
                                    during the long years of the neglect of secondary education by the state, and when in 1901 the famous judgment in the test

                                    the legislature must without delay step in to secure the educational work which the undoubtedly correct principles of
                                    judicial interpretation had placed in jeopardy.</p>

                                    inquire into this branch of education. The terms of reference excluded elementary education, and the report may be taken as
                                    embodying the views of that school of educational statesmen who held that progress would best be attained by keeping
                                    elementary and secondary education entirely separate for purposes of local administration, the parish being regarded as the
                                    natural unit for elementary and the county for secondary education, a topic to which it will be necessary to revert in

                                    recommendations of the commission were: <list>
                                        <item>(1) the unification of the existing central authorities, viz. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_and_Art_Department">the Department of Science and Art</name>, <name type="institution">the Charity Commission</name> (so far as it dealt with educational endowments), and <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>, in one central office, and the establishment of an
                                            educational council to advise the minister of education in certain professional matters;</item>
                                        <item>(2) the establishment of local authorities, to consist of committees of the county councils with co-opted elements
                                            ;</item>
                                        <item>(3) the formation of a register of teachers with a view to the encouragement of professional training, and a
                                            system of school registration upon the basis of inspection and examination</item>
                                    </list>. The first of these recommendations was carried out by <name type="institution">the Board of Education Act
                                        1899</name>, as mentioned below, and under the same act an attempt was made to give some effect to the third-named
                                    object, which, though it unfortunately fell short of success, may serve as a point of departure for further efforts. The
                                    realization of the second, and the most important, of the recommendations was deferred till 1902, when it was brought about
                                    as a part of a wider reorganization of the educational system.</p>

                                    the growing financial burden which was laid upon them by that steady raising of the standard to which reference has been
                                    made above. In 1896 an endeavour was made to meet the demands of the voluntary managers by means of a bill introduced by
                                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Eldon_Gorst">Sir John Gorst</name> on behalf of the
                                    Conservative government. This bill with its provision for a special aid grant to be administered by county education
                                    authorities, which were to exist side by side with the school boards, represented a kind of compromise between the systems
                                    of 1870 and 1902. It encountered opposition in all quarters and was withdrawn. In 1897, however, the position of the
                                    denominational schools was strengthened by <title>the Voluntary Schools Act</title>, which provided for a special aid grant
                                    of five shillings per head of the scholars in average attendance in these schools.</p>

                                    and political strife it is not easy for contemporaries to view it objectively and in its true proportions. Nevertheless,
                                    considered historically, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> becomes intelligible as
                                    the product of the forces, partly religious and partly educational, which have been already described. The immediate impulse
                                    for this measure must be sought in the agitation that during the preceding decade had been gathering force among the
                                    adherents of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</name> churches for equality
                                    of financial treatment as between voluntary and board schools. It must be placed to the credit of the constructive
                                    statesmanship of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_(UK)">the Conservative
                                        party</name> that it availed itself of an ecclesiastical agitation to take an important step forward in the organization
                                    of national education. The difficulty inherent in such a measure was the admitted difficulty of securing public control, as
                                    a necessary concomitant of public maintenance, without jeopardizing or destroying the special religious character of the
                                    voluntary schools. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act of 1902</title> sought to solve this
                                    problem, so difficult of solution under democratic conditions, upon the principle of a division of financial responsibility
                                    justifying a corresponding division of control between the voluntary managers and the local authority. The constitution of
                                    the local authority to be charged not only with the delicate duty of participating in the dual control of the voluntary
                                    public elementary schools, but also with the responsible task of co-ordinating public higher with public elementary
                                    education, presented features of controversy only less formidable than the purely religious question itself. Boldly
                                    reversing the settlement of 1870, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>

                                    solution propounded by Conservative statesmanship in the middle period of the 19th century and endorsed by an important
                                    memorandum contributed by <name type="person">Lord Sandford</name> (formerly permanent secretary of <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>) to the report of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._A._Cross,_1st_Viscount_Cross">Cross</name> Commission. The unquestionable
                                    niggardliness and inefficiency of many small country school boards, which had been foretold by the prescience of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">Newcastle</name> Commissioners, constituted the chief
                                    educational argument for the selection of the wider area so far as the interests of elementary education alone were
                                    concerned. On the other hand, experience has shown that in the rural districts against the undoubted gain in general
                                    efficiency there must be set a certain loss on account of the decay of local and personal interest consequent upon the
                                    centralization of authority in the hands of the county councils. Account, too, must be taken of the comparative heaviness
                                    with which a uniform county rate is apt to press upon sparsely populated agricultural parishes, especially in counties which
                                    include considerable industrial districts. Notwithstanding these minor drawbacks, it may be said that upon the whole the
                                    best opinion has endorsed the policy of 1902 with respect to the area of administration. At any rate it has been necessary
                                    to recognize the impracticability of disestablishing the strongly organized provincial authorities which <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> brought into being, and proposals for amendment in
                                    this particular have been confined to schemes, favoured in principle by all parties, for securing some measure of
                                    decentralization and delegation of powers calculated to restore and stimulate local interest without derogating from the
                                    financial and administrative responsibility of the county council.</p>

                                <p>A provision, § 7 (6), known from the name of its author (d. 1908), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Colonel Kenyon Slaney, M.P.</name>, as the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name> clause, attracted considerable attention
                                    and formed the subject of much ecclesiastical controversy during the passage of the bill through parliament. The <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name> clause requires the religious
                                    instruction in voluntary schools to be in accordance with the provisions (if any) of the trust deed, but also to be under
                                    the control of the managers as a whole, whereas the common form of trust deed of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Society_for_Promoting_Religious_Education">the National Society</name>
                                    reserves the control of religious instruction to the clergyman, whilst the clause was equally in conflict with the
                                    well-known sacerdotal principles of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the
                                        Roman Catholic Church</name>. Thus the clause represented a revival, as did the questions with respect to foundation
                                    managers, of the early controversy over the management clauses of <name type="institution">the Committee of Council on
                                        Education</name>. Its special interest lies, not so much in its intrinsic importance, as in the precedent it affords,
                                    specially notable as emanating from a Conservative source, for the overruling of trust deeds upon grounds of public policy.
                                    By way of saving another familiar provision of the trust deeds, a proviso to the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name> clause reserves the existing trust-deed
                                    rights of appeal to the bishop or other denominational authority as to the character of the religious instruction.</p>

                                    school, the L.E.A. (in the case of proposed voluntary schools) or any ten ratepayers of the district, to <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> on the ground that the proposed school is not required, or that a
                                    school provided by the L.E.A., or not so provided, as the case might be, is better suited to meet the wants of the district
                                    than the proposed school. Any enlargement of a public elementary school which in the opinion of <name type="institution">the

                                    the section, and any transfer of a school to or from the L.E.A. must be treated as the provision of a new school. In
                                    deciding appeals as to new schools and in determining a case of dispute whether a school was necessary or not, <name type="institution">the board</name> are directed to have regard to the interest of secular instruction, the wishes of
                                    parents as to the education of children, and the economy of the rates, but existing schools are not to be considered
                                    unnecessary if the average attendance is not less than thirty (§§ 8-9). The last-mentioned canons have played a prominent
                                    part in subsequent discussions. Experience of these sections has shown that though it is extremely difficult to set up new
                                    voluntary schools in face of opposition from the L.E.A., such opposition is rarely offered or pressed where any really
                                    strong local demand is shown to exist.</p>

                                <p>The hostility of Nonconformists to the extension of rate-aid to denominational schools led to the organization upon a
                                    considerable scale of what became known as the <q>" Passive Resistance "</q> movement, a number of Nonconformist rate-payers
                                    refusing to pay the education rate on the ground that their consciences forbade their supporting the religious teaching in
                                    denominational schools; and their willingness to become subject to distraint and consequent inconveniences rather than pay
                                    the rates became the foundation of a widespread political campaign. In Wales, where in the rural districts the schools were
                                    commonly Anglican whilst the population was Nonconformist, particular difficulties arose in administering <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> in consequence of the hostile attitude of the
                                    county authorities. Friction likewise manifested itself in one or two English areas, which reflected militant Nonconformist
                                    views. Accordingly the government passed <title>the Local Education (Local Authority Default) Act 1904</title>, empowering
                                        <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, in the case of default by the local authority, to make payments
                                    direct to the managers of the school and to deduct the amount from the sums payable to the defaulting authority on account
                                    of parliamentary grants.</p>

                                    with the object of securing full public control of all rate-aided schools and the appointment of teachers without reference
                                    to religious belief. The bill was of a highly complex character; its principal features were,—compulsory transfer of
                                    existing voluntary schools to the local authority, facilities for the giving of denominational instruction in transferred
                                    schools out of school hours by persons other than the regular teachers, and the recognition in populous districts, upon the
                                    demand of parents, of special publicly maintained schools in which denominational teaching could be included in the
                                    curriculum ; the latter schools might (according to the bill as finally amended) in the last resort, i.e. if the local
                                    authority refused to maintain them, be recognized as state-aided schools. The bill encountered strong opposition from
                                    Anglicans and Catholics (though the Catholic Irish members finally voted for it as amended); it passed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name> by a large majority,
                                    but after unavailing attempts at compromise upon the amendments introduced in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords">the House of Lords</name>, the two Houses failed to agree and the
                                    measure was lost.</p>

                                        contracting out."</q> In single-school parishes the existing schools were to be compulsorily transferred, subject to the
                                    grant of denominational facilities out of school hours; elsewhere a sufficiency of places in schools with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name>
                                    teaching, which the bill proposed to make compulsory in all provided schools, must be supplied by the local authority, while
                                    existing voluntary schools might become state-aided schools upon terms of receiving a grant of 47s. per head. The bill was
                                    accompanied by a financial scheme for a new system of allocating the parliamentary grant. In view of the improbability of
                                    its passing into law the bill was <pb n="981" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0981.png"/> not pressed beyond the stage of second reading.

                                    and in the autumn he introduced a fresh measure framed as the result of negotiations between the government and the

                                    designed to be passed rapidly through parliament by consent of all parties. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name>'s bill, like his
                                    predecessor's, was based upon the principle of compulsory transfer in single-school parishes and contracting out elsewhere,
                                    but it gave a right of entry for denominational teaching on two days a week during school hours in all council schools
                                    whether transferred voluntary schools or otherwise, with liberty to employ for this purpose assistant teachers, but not
                                    (save temporarily at first in transferred schools) head teachers. Provision was also made for the payment of a small rent
                                    which would be applicable for or towards the cost of the denominational instruction. Unfortunately, the compromise failed at
                                    the last moment for want of agreement as to the financial terms cf <q>" contracting out,"</q> the government offering 50s.
                                    per head and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Church</name> demanding 7s.
                                    more. It is obvious that <q>" contracting out "</q> is open to serious objection upon educational and economic grounds, and
                                    that if resorted to upon any very considerable scale it would involve a disruption of the public elementary system, and a
                                    duplication of schools which would constitute a wasteful drain upon the national exchequer. Upon such a system, therefore,
                                    some check is necessary, and, once decided that the check should take the form of financial pressure, rather than request of
                                    parents as in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_Birrell">Mr Birrell</name>'s bill, or some form
                                    of administrative control, the question of pecuniary terms became one of principle and not merely of financial detail.
                                    Moreover, the difficulty of adjusting differences was intensified by the opposition of the extremists on either side, which
                                    daily gathered force, and the bill was withdrawn by the government when in committee of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name>. The conciliatory efforts of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name> and

                                    Nonconformists important concessions to each other's views, engendering reasonable hopes of an ultimate settlement being

                                        1906</title> enabled local education authorities to aid voluntary agencies in the provision of meals for children
                                    attending public elementary schools, and in certain cases with the consent of <name type="institution">the Board of

                                <p>In 1907 an uncontroversial act entitled <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_(Administrative_Provisions)_Act_1907">the Education (Administrative
                                        Provisions) Act</title>, besides dealing with various matters of technical and administrative detail, laid upon local
                                    education authorities the new duty of providing for the medical inspection of all children attending public elementary
                                    schools. In connexion with this act <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> established a medical department
                                    to advise and assist them in supervising local education authorities in carrying out their statutory duties in this regard.
                                    The whole departure is significant of the new sense of the importance of physical culture and hygiene which has been one of

                                    placing secular education in public elementary schools under the control of strongly organized local education authorities
                                    may be said to have largely removed such dangers as were to be apprehended from the relaxation in question. Thus it was
                                    possible for <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> in the code of 1904 to abolish the last traces of the
                                    system of payment by results, by setting forth (in the language of their report for 1903-1904) <quote>" a properly
                                        co-ordinated curriculum suitable to the needs of the children, with an indication of the relation which the various
                                        subjects of instruction should bear to each other, in place of the relatively haphazard list of possible branches of
                                        knowledge which were formerly presented to the choice of individual schools or authorities."</quote> In the new code
                                    also the board for the first time endeavoured to state for the guidance of teachers and parents the proper aim of the public
                                    elementary school, laying stress upon that element of the training of character which the system of payment by results had
                                    so unfortunately obscured. The new spirit was strikingly manifested in the volume of <title>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Suggestions
                                            for the Considerations of Teachers</hi>
                                    </title>, issued by <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> in
                                    1905. This volume represented a notable attempt to connect administration with educational theory, without in any way
                                    seeking to crush individual initiative, or to impose a bureaucratic uniformity of method upon those engaged in the actual
                                    work of the schools. Apprehension of the true aim of elementary education as essentially and primarily a preparation for
                                    practical life has led to a corresponding development of instruction of a practical character, observation lessons and
                                    nature study being treated as a necessary element in the curriculum, while handicraft and gardening, and domestic subjects
                                    (for girls), are encouraged by special grants. Particular attention has been bestowed both by the central and local
                                    authorities upon the problem of rural instruction, and much has been done in many areas to bring the schools into closer
                                    relations with the needs of agricultural and rural life generally. In this way the old and perhaps not altogether
                                    ill-founded distrust of popular education as tending to unfit the working classes for industrial pursuits is being broken
                                    down and a public opinion more favourable to educational progress in the widest sense is being created.</p>
                                <p>According to the official returns for 1907-1908, the total number of scholars on the registers (England only) was as follows:
                                    —council schools, 2,991,741; voluntary schools, 2,566,030; total, 5,557,771, and the total attendance upon which grant was
                                    paid was 4,928,659. The percentage of actual average attendance to average number on the registers was 88-50%. The
                                    parliamentary grant (England and Wales) for elementary schools, other than higher elementary, amounted to £11,023,433.</p>

                                    </ref> Under the revised pupil-teacher system established by the regulations of 1903
                                    provision is made for the instruction of pupil teachers in centres which as far as possible are attached to secondary
                                    schools receiving grants from <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> under the regulations for secondary
                                    schools, about two-thirds of the secondary schools on the grant list undertaking this work. Accordingly, the result of
                                    recent changes is to modify the old system in two ways: first by providing the alternative of a full course of secondary
                                    education, secondly by associating pupil teachership itself as far as possible with part-time attendance at a secondary
                                    school. The total number of pupil teachers recognized during the year 1907-1908 was 20,571, and of these 9770 were in
                                    centres forming integral parts of secondary schools. The number of bursars who passed the leaving examination was 1486.</p>

                                        1902</title> lay in the deficiency of training colleges in view of the increased number of teachers. Local authorities
                                    naturally hesitated to burden themselves with the cost of providing such institutions in view of the fact that there is
                                    nothing to prevent teachers trained at great expense by one authority taking service under a less public-spirited authority
                                    who had contributed nothing to such training ; hence a widespread feeling that the provision of training colleges should be
                                    undertaken by the state as a matter of national concern. Under these circumstances a new system of building grants in aid of
                                    the establishment of training colleges was instituted in 1905. In 1906 these grants were raised from 25 to 75 % of the
                                    capital expenditure, but were limited to colleges provided by local authorities. A further difficulty in view of the
                                    municipalization of education arose from the fact that the majority of the residential colleges were in the hands of
                                    denominational trusts which did not admit a conscience clause. Under the presidency of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_McKenna">Mr McKenna</name> in 1907, <ref>

                                <p>The fear has been widely entertained that a considerable part of the national expenditure upon elementary education is wasted
                                    for want of an effective system of continuative instruction to be given out of working hours to adolescents engaged in
                                    industrial employment. The whole subject was exhaustively <pb n="983" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0983.png"/> treated by the report in 1909 of <name type="institution">the Consultative Committee</name> of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>. This
                                    report seeks to base an efficient continuative system upon the improvement of elementary education by reducing the size of
                                    the classes in the elementary schools upon the lines now laid down by the new staffing regulations of 1909; by increasing
                                    the amount of instruction in hand-work with a view to rendering the curriculum less bookish and more efficient as a training
                                    for industrial and agricultural life; and by legislation to reform the system of half-time attendance and raise the age of
                                    compulsory attendance to thirteen and ultimately fourteen. Upon the foundation of an improved and prolonged elementary
                                    education there would be reared a superstructure of continuative schools or classes, attendance at which up to seventeen
                                    would be compulsory under bye-laws adoptive locally at the option of the local education authorities. In 1906-1907 about 21
                                    per thousand of the population of England and Wales attended evening schools and classes inspected by <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, and grant amounting to £361,596 was paid in respect of 440,718 regular
                                    attendants.</p>

                                    19th century secondary instruction in England was still provided chiefly by endowed grammar-schools, by proprietary schools
                                    established by religious bodies or joint-stock companies, and by private enterprise. No public provision was made for
                                    secondary education as such; what financial assistance was forthcoming from municipal sources was given indirectly under
                                    cover of the grants under <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>, while in the administration of central grants for

                                    <title>Act 1899</title>, no absolute
                                    differentiation between secondary and technological functions was recognized. The establishment of local authorities with
                                    direct duties in respect of secondary education, and the reorganization of the central office with reference to the three
                                    branches of education, elementary, secondary and technological, rendered possible for the first time an adequate treatment
                                    of the problem of public secondary education as a whole. <ref>

                                            science classes were gradually built up into schools of science. Schools of science were subsequently widened into
                                            schools of what was known as the <q>' Division A '</q> type, providing a course of instruction in science in
                                            connexion with, and as part of, a course of general education. Aid was afterwards extended to schools of the <q>'

                                <p>Two main tendencies distinguish the recent development: on the one hand the tendency to municipalization, or at least to the
                                    establishment of public control; on the other hand the tendency (marked especially by the regulations of 1907) to greater
                                    elasticity in regard to curricula, and so to the freer encouragement of local initiative and local effort.</p>
                                <p>In 1907 the government of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Campbell-Bannerman">Sir Henry
                                        Campbell-Bannerman</name> placed greatly increased funds at the disposal of <name type="institution">the Board of
                                        Education</name> for the purpose of secondary education. The regulations under which the increased grant was
                                    administered imposed conditions in respect of freedom from denominational restrictions or requirements, representative local
                                    control, and accessibility to all classes of the people, which, like the analogous rules with regard to training colleges,
                                    roused considerable controversy. With regard to religious instruction, the requirement was made that no catechism or
                                    formulary distinctive of any particular religious denomination might be taught in the school except upon the request in
                                    writing of the parent or guardian and at the cost of funds other than grants of public money. Power was at the same time
                                    reserved to <name type="institution">the board</name> to waive the new conditions in the event of the local education
                                    authority passing a resolution that the school was in their view required as part of the secondary school provision for
                                    their area, and that the conditions, or one or more of them, might be waived with advantage in view of the educational needs
                                    of the area. It will be noticed that one effect of the regulations (as of the training college regulations) was to recognize
                                    as a kind of established religion those elements of Christianity which are shared in common by the various Protestant
                                    churches, according to the system of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name>
                                    and the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise. Normally schools are required to provide 25 % of free places for scholars from public
                                    elementary schools, and, with a view to encouraging the transference of children from the public elementary school at an
                                    early age, a grant of £2 was made payable on account of ex-public elementary scholars between ten and twelve years of age.
                                    The full scale of grants is £2 for ex-public elementary scholars between ten and twelve, and £5 for scholars between twelve
                                    and eighteen. To schools previously recognized and failing to comply with the new conditions, grant may be paid on the lower
                                    scale of £2 and £2, 10s. respectively.</p>
                                <p>Secondary school grants are assessed upon average attendance, and efficiency is guaranteed by inspection and not by
                                    individual examination. All recognized schools must provide at least the substantial equivalent of the four-years' course
                                    formerly required, and recognition is withheld or withdrawn if an adequate number of the scholars do not remain at least
                                    four years in the school, or do not remain up to sixteen ; in rural areas, however, and small towns, a school life of three
                                    years and a leaving age of fifteen may be accepted. <ref>

                                    and Wales respectively, Wales continued to be treated as one with England for purposes of educational administrationdown to
                                    quite recent years. Towards the end of the 19th century the striking revival of Welsh nationality, in itself largely an
                                    educational and a literary movement, led to a spontaneous demand among the Welsh people for the organization of a national
                                    system of higher education. In accordance with the recommendations of a special royal commission <title>the Welsh
                                        Intermediate Education Act</title> passed in 1889 provided for the creation in every county in Wales (including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</name>) of joint education committees
                                    consisting of three nominees of the county council and two nominees of the lord president of the council. To these

                                    <hi rend="italic">History.</hi>—The first white settlers who came to North America were typical representatives of those
                                    European peoples who had made more progress in civilization than any other in the world. Those settlers, in particular those
                                    from England and from Holland, brought with them the most advanced ideas of the time on the subject of education. The
                                    conditions of life in the New World emphasized the need of schools and colleges, and among the earliest public acts of the
                                    settlers were provisions to establish them. The steps taken between 1619 and 1622 to provide schools for the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginia">Virginia</name> were frustrated by the Indian war which broke
                                    out in the latter year, and were never successfully renewed during the colonial period. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name>, where the influence of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name> was at, first predominant, elementary schools were
                                    maintained at the public expense, and were intended for the education of all classes of the population. This policy
                                    reflected the very advanced views as to public elementary education which were then held in the Netherlands. The assumption
                                    of control in the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people">the English</name> was a distinct check to the
                                    development of public elementary education, and little or no further progress was made until after the Revolution. The most
                                    systematic educational policy was pursued in the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name>. As early as 1635, five years after it was founded,
                                    the town of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name> took action to the end that <quote>"
                                        our brother <name type="person">Philemon Pormort</name> shall be entreated to become schoolmaster for the teaching and
                                        nurturing children with us."</quote>
                                    <name type="institution">The General Court</name> of the colony in 1636 made the
                                    first appropriation for what was to become <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_College">Harvard College</name>, taking its name in honour of the minister, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Harvard_(clergyman)">John Harvard</name>, who died in 1638, leaving his library
                                    and one-half of his property, having a value of £800, to the new institution. The amount of this appropriation of 1636
                                    (£400) was remarkable in that it was probably equal to the whole colony tax for a year. In 1642 followed a legislative act
                                    which, while saying nothing of schools, gave to the selectmen in every town power to oversee both the education and the
                                    employment of children. It is made the duty of the selectmen to see that the children can read and understand the principles
                                    of religion and the capital laws of the country, and that they are put to some useful work.</p>
                                <p>Five years later, in 1647, was enacted the law which is not only the real foundation of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> school system, but the type of later legislation
                                    throughout the United States. This epoch-making act, the first of its kind in the world, represented the public opinion of a
                                    colony of about 20,000 persons, living in thirty towns. It required every town of fifty householders to establish a school,
                                    the master of which should be paid either by the parents of the children taught or by public tax, as the majority of the
                                    town committee might decide ; and it further required every town of one hundred families or householders to set up a grammar
                                    school in which pupils might be prepared for the <q>" University,"</q> as the new institution at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambridge,_Massachusetts">Cambridge</name> was designated. Moreover, a penalty was
                                    attached to neglect of this legislative requirement, in the form of a fine to be devoted to the maintenance of the nearest
                                    school. <ref>

                                            <quote>" It is impossible for us adequately to conceive the boldness of the measure, which aimed at universal
                                            education through the establishment of free schools. As a fact, it had no precedent in the world's history ; and, as
                                            a theory, it could have been refuted and silenced by a more formidable array of argument and experience than was
                                            ever marshalled against any other institution of human origin. But time has ratified its soundness. Two centuries of
                                            successful operation now proclaim it to be as wise as it was courageous, and as beneficent as it was

                                    </ref> The significance of these acts of 1642 and 1647 is that they foreshadow the whole
                                    American system of education, including elementary schools, secondary schools and colleges, and that they indicate the

                                    was accomplished in those colonies which was permanent. The sentiment in the more southern colonies was, as a rule,
                                    unfriendly to free schools, and nothing of importance was attempted in that section of the country until the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</name>. Through religious zeal or

In the colleges the ecclesiastical spirit
                                    was at first almost uniformly dominant. The greater number of their students were preparing for the ministry in some one of
                                    the branches of the Protestant Church. These facts caused the grammar schools to take on more and more the character of
                                    college-preparatory schools; and when this was brought about they supplied the educational needs of but one portion of the
                                    community. As time passed, the interdependence of governmental <pb n="985" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0985.png"/> and ecclesiastical interests began to weaken in
                                    the colonies, and there arose among those who represented the new secularizing tendency a distrust of the colleges and their
                                    influence. This gave rise to a new and influential type of school, the academy, which took its name from the secondary
                                    schools established in England by the dissenting religious bodies during the latter part of the seventeenth century at the
                                    suggestion of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Milton">Milton</name>. These academies were intended
                                    to give an education which was thought to be more practical than that offered by the colleges, and they drew their students
                                    from the so-called middle classes of society. The older academies were usually endowed institutions, organized under the
                                    control of religious organizations or of self-perpetuating boards of trustees. Their programme of studies was less
                                    restricted than that of the grammar schools, and they gave new emphasis to the study of the English language and its
                                    literature, of mathematics and of the new sciences of nature. For two generations the academies were a most beneficent
                                    factor in American education, and they supplied a large number of the better-prepared teachers for work in other schools.
                                    These schools were in a sense public in that they were chartered, but they were not directly under public control in their
                                    management. Early in the 19th century there arose a well-defined demand for public secondary schools—high schools, as they
                                    are popularly known. They were the direct outgrowth of the elementary school system. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baltimore">Baltimore</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> were the first of the large cities to establish schools
                                    of this type, and they spread rapidly. These public secondary schools met with opposition, however, springing partly from
                                    the friends of the academies, and partly from those who held that governmental agency should be restricted to the field of
                                    elementary education. The legal questions raised were settled by a decision of the supreme court of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan">Michigan</name>, which contained these words: <quote>" Neither in our state
                                        policy, in our constitution, nor in our laws do we find the primary school districts restricted in the branches of
                                        knowledge which their officers may cause to be taught, or the grade of instruction that may be given, if their voters
                                        consent, in regular form, to bear the expense and raise the taxes for the purpose."</quote> This decision gave marked
                                    impetus to the development of public secondary or high schools, and they have increased rapidly in number. The academies
                                    have relatively declined, and in the Western states are almost unknown.</p>
                                <p>Meanwhile the elementary school system had grown rapidly. The school district, the smallest civil division, was created in
                                        <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut">Connecticut</name> in 1701, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhode_Island">Rhode Island</name> about 1750, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> in 1789. From the point of view of efficient,
                                    wellsupported schools, it has been felt since the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace_Mann">Horace Mann</name> that the substitution of the small school district for the town as the unit of school administration
                                    was a mistake. Yet the school district has exercised a profound influence for good upon the American people. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York state</name>, for example there were in 1900 over
                                    eleven thousand school districts, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illinois">Illinois</name> over
                                    twelve thousand. The districts are small in extent and often sparsely settled. Their government is as democratic as
                                    possible. The resident legal voters, often including women, hold a meeting at least once a year. They elect trustees to
                                    represent them in the employment of the teacher and the management of the school. They determine whether a new schoolhouse
                                    shall be built, whether repairs shall be made, and what sum of money shall be raised for school purposes. In the rural
                                    districts this system has often been itself a school in patriotism and in the conduct of public affairs. Recently the
                                    tendency is to merge the school districts into the township, in order that larger and better schools may be maintained, and
                                    that educational advantages may be distributed more evenly among the people. Most of the southern states have the county
                                    system of school administration. This is because the county, rather than the township, has been the political unit in the
                                    south from the beginning. Special laws have been made for the school system in cities, and the form of these laws differs
                                    very much. In nearly every city there is a separate board of education, sometimes chosen by the voters, sometimes appointed
                                    by the mayor or other official, which board has full control of the schools. The city board of education has as its
                                    executive officer a superintendent of schools, who has become a most important factor in American educational
                                    administration. He exerts great influence in the selection of teachers, in the choice of text-books, in the arrangement of
                                    the programme of studies, and in the determination of questions of policy. Sometimes he is charged by law with the
                                    initiative in some or all of these matters. He is usually a trained administrator as well as an experienced teacher. The
                                    first superintendent was appointed in 1837 at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buffalo,_New_York">Buffalo</name>. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Providence,_Rhode_Island">Providence</name>

In general, it may be said that the progress
                                    of public education in the United States is marked by <list>
                                        <item>(1) compulsory schools,</item>
                                        <item>(2) compulsory licensing of teachers,</item>
                                        <item>(3) compulsory school attendance,</item>
                                        <item>and (4) compulsory school supervision,</item>
                                    </list> and by the increasingly efficient administration of these provisions. The compulsion comes in each case from the
                                    state government, which alone, in the American system, has the power to prescribe it and to enforce it. Each state is
                                    therefore an independent educational unit, and there is no single, uniform American system of education in any legal sense.
                                    In fact, however, the great mass of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_of_the_United_States">the
                                        American people</name> are in entire agreement as to the principles which should control public education; and the
                                    points in which the policies of the several states are in agreement are greater, both in number and in importance, than
                                    those in which they differ. An American educational system exists, therefore, in spirit and in substance, even though not in
                                    form.</p>

                                        United States</title> is there any mention of education. The founders of the nation were by no means indifferent to
                                    education, but they shared the common view of their time, which was that the real responsibility for the maintenance of
                                    schools and the expense of maintaining them should fall upon the several local communities. The relation of government to
                                    education was not then a subject of ordinary consideration or discussion. Later, when this question did arise and the power
                                    of taxation was involved, the several states assumed control of education, as it was necessary that they should do.
                                    Nevertheless, from the very beginning the national government has aided and supported education, while not controlling it.
                                    This policy dates from the 13th of July 1787, when there was passed the famous <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northwest_Ordinance">" Ordinance for the Government of the Territory of the United
                                        States North-West of the River Ohio,"</title> meaning the territory north and west of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio_River">the Ohio river</name> now represented by the states of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio">Ohio</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indiana">Indiana</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illinois">Illinois</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan">Michigan</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wisconsin">Wisconsin</name>, and the eastern side of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minnesota">Minnesota</name>, embracing more than 265,000 sq. m. of territory.

                                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northwest_Ordinance">The Ordinance of 1787</title> also reaffirmed the provisions of
                                    the so-called <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Land_Ordinance_of_1785">Land Ordinance of 1785</title>, by which
                                    section No. 16 in every township (a township consists of 36 numbered sections of 1 sq. m. each), or one thirty-sixth of the
                                    entire north-west territory, was set aside for the maintenance of public schools within the township. The funds derived from
                                    the sale and lease of these original <q>" school lands "</q> form the major portion of the public school endowment of the
                                    states formed out of the north-west territory. The precedent thus established became the policy of the nation. Each state
                                    admitted prior to 1848 reserved section No. 16 in every township of public land for common schools. Each state admitted
                                    since 1848 (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Utah">Utah</name> being an exception, and having four
                                    sections) has reserved sections No. 16 and No. 36 in every township of public lands for this purpose. In addition, the
                                    national government has granted two townships in every state and territory containing public lands for seminaries or
                                    universities. A third land grant is that made in 1862 for colleges of agriculture and the mechanical arts. The sum total of
                                    these three land grants amounted in <pb n="986" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0986.png"/> 1900 to 78,659,439 acres, to which there must be added various special
                                    grants made from time to time to the states and devoted to education. The portion of the public domain so set apart in 1900
                                    amounted in all to 86,138,473 acres, or 134,591 English sq. m. This is an area greater than those of the six <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_England">New England</name> states, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey">New Jersey</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maryland">Maryland</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delaware">Delaware</name> added together. It is a portion of the earth's surface as
                                    great as the kingdom of Prussia, about seven-tenths as great as France, and considerably greater than the combined areas of
                                    Great Britain (including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Channel_Islands">the Channel Islands</name>)
                                    and the kingdom of Holland. Besides the enormous grants of land in aid of education, the national government has maintained
                                    since 1802 a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Military_Academy">military academy at

                                <p>In the United States the sovereign powers are not all lodged in one place. Such of those powers as are not granted by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Constitution">the Constitution</title> to the national government are
                                    reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. The power to levy taxes for the support of public education has been
                                    almost universally held to be one of the powers so reserved. The inhabitants of the several local communities, however
                                    indisposed they may have been to relinquish absolute control of their own schools, have been compelled to yield to the
                                    authority of the state government whenever it has been asserted, for except under such authority no civil division—county,
                                    city, township, or school district—possesses the power to levy taxes for school purposes. Moreover, since the exercise of
                                    state authority has uniformly improved the quality of the schools, it has usually been welcomed, not resisted. In general,
                                    it may be said that the state has used its authority to prescribe a minimum of efficiency which schools and teachers must
                                    reach, and it enforces this minimum through inspection and the withholding of its proper share of the state school fund from
                                    any locality where schools or teachers are permitted to fall below the required standard. In extreme cases the state
                                    authorities have interfered directly to prevent the evil results of local inefficiency or contumacy. In addition, the
                                    states, almost without exception, maintain at their own expense schools for the training of teachers, known as normal
                                    schools. Many of the states also offer inducements to the cities, towns and districts to exceed the prescribed minimum of
                                    efficiency. Through the steady exercise of state supervision the school buildings have improved, the standard for entrance
                                    upon the work of teaching has been raised, the programme of studies has been made more effective and more uniform, and the
                                    length of the school term has increased. The Constitution of every state now contains some provision as to public education.
                                    Each state has an executive officer charged with the enforcement of the state school laws. Sometimes, ab in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name>, this official has plenary powers ; sometimes,
                                    as in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio">Ohio</name>, he is little more than an adviser. In twenty-nine states this

                                    ; other titles used are commissioner of public schools, superintendent of common schools, and superintendent of public
                                    schools. The schools are administered, on behalf of the taxpayers, by an elected board of school trustees in rural school
                                    districts, and by an elected (though sometimes appointed) board of education or school committee in cities and towns. In 836
                                    cities and towns there is a local superintendent of schools, who directs and supervises the educational work and acts as the
                                    executive officer of the board of education. The schools in the rural districts are under the direct supervision of a county
                                    superintendent of schools or similar official, who is often chosen by the people, but who sometimes is named by the state
                                    authorities. The county and city superintendents are often charged with the duty of holding examinations for entrance upon
                                    the work of teaching, and of issuing licences to those persons who pass the examinations. This system works best where it is
                                    carefully regulated by state law. Thirty states, one territory, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington,_D.C.">the District of Columbia</name> have enacted compulsory education
                                    laws, but the enforcement of them is usually very lax. In fifteen states and territories there are no compulsory education
                                    laws, although there are in existence there fully organized school systems free to all children. The usual age during which
                                    school attendance is required is from 8 to 14. Provision is made in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maine">Maine</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Hampshire">New Hampshire</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhode_Island">Rhode Island</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut">Connecticut</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey">New Jersey</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indiana">Indiana</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minnesota">Minnesota</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan">Michigan</name>, for sending
                                    habitual truants to some special institution. Laws forbidding the employment of children under a specified minimum age in
                                    any mercantile or manufacturing establishment are in force in twelve states, and are usually administered in connexion with
                                    the compulsory education laws.</p>

                                    kindergarten principles in the United States, has pointed out that the history of the kindergnrten movement reveals four
                                    distinct <pb n="987" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.08.0987.png"/> stages in its development: the pioneer stage, having <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name> as its centre; the philanthropic stage, which began in the
                                    village of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,_Massachusetts">Florence, Mass.</name>, and reached
                                    its climax at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Francisco">San Francisco, California</name>; the
                                    national or strictly educational stage, which began at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Louis,_Missouri">St Louis</name>; and the so-called maternal stage, which from
                                        <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago">Chicago</name> as a centre is spreading over the entire
                                    country. During the first stage public attention was directed to a few of the most important aspects of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Fröbel">Froebel</name>'s teaching. During the second stage the kindergarten
                                    was valued largely as a reformatory and redemptive influence. During the third stage the fundamental principles underlying
                                    kindergarten training were scientifically studied and expounded, and the kindergarten became part of the public school
                                    system of the country. The fourth stage, which, like the third, is fortunately still in existence, aims at making the
                                    kindergarten a link between the school and the home, and so to use it to strengthen the foundations and elevate the ideals
                                    of family life. By 1898 there were 4363 kindergartens in the United States (1365 of which were public), employing 9937
                                    teachers (2532 in the public kindergartens) and enrolling 189,604 children (95,867 in the public kindergartens). Of the 164
                                    public normal schools, 36 made provision for training kindergarten teachers. The scientific and literary activity of some of
                                    the private kindergarten training classes is very great, and they exert a beneficial and stimulating effect on teaching in
                                    the elementary schools. It is generally admitted that from the point of view of the children, of the teachers, of the
                                    schools, and of the community at large, the kindergarten has been and is an inspiration of incalculable value.</p>

                                <p>The elementary school course is from six to nine years in length, the ordinary period being eight years. The pupils enter at
                                    about six years of age. In the cities the elementary schools are usually in session for five hours daily, except Saturday
                                    and Sunday, beginning at 9 A.M. There is an intermission, usually of an hour, at midday, and short recesses during the
                                    sessions. In the small rural schools the pupils are usually ungraded, and are taught singly or in varying groups. In the
                                    cities and towns there is a careful gradation of pupils, and promotions from grade to grade are made at intervals of a year
                                    or of a half-year. The best schools have the most elastic system of gradation and the most frequent promotions. In a number
                                    of states there are laws authorizing the conveyance of children to school at the public expense, when the schoolhouse is
                                    unduly distant from the homes of a portion of the school population. Co-education (q.v.) in the elementary school has been
                                    the salutary and almost uniform practice in the United States. The programme of studies in the elementary school includes
                                    English (reading, writing, spelling, grammar, composition), arithmetic (sometimes elementary algebra also, or plane geometry
                                    in the upper grades), geography, history of the United States, and elementary natural science, including human physiology
                                    and hygiene. Physical training, vocal music, drawing and manual training are often taught. Sometimes a foreign language
                                    (Latin, German or French) and the study of general history are begun. Formal instruction in manners and morals is not often
                                    found, but the discipline of the school offers the best possible training in the habits of truthfulness, honesty, obedience,
                                    regularity, punctuality and conformity to order. Religious teaching is not permitted, although the exercises of the day are
                                    often opened with reading from <title>the Bible</title>, the repetition of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord's_Prayer">the Lord's Prayer</title> and the singing of a hymn. Corporal punishment
                                    is not infrequent, but is forbidden by law in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey">New
                                        Jersey</name>, and in many states may be used only under restrictions. Text-books are used as the basis of the
                                    instruction given, and the pupils <q>" recite "</q> in class to the teacher, who, by use of illustration and comment, makes
                                    clear the subject-matter of the prescribed lesson. The purpose of the recitation method is to make the work of each pupil
                                    help that of his companion. Skilfully used, it is the most effectual instrument yet devised for elementary school
                                    instruction.</p>

                                <p>The secondary school course is normally four years in length. The principal subjects studied are Latin, Greek, French,
                                    German, algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, physical geography, physiology, rhetoric, English literature, civics and
                                    history. Although but 11-36 % of the students in public high schools and 25-36 % of those in private secondary schools are
                                    preparing for a college or scientific school, yet the conditions prescribed by the colleges for admission to their courses
                                    affect powerfully both the secondary school programme and the methods of teaching. Of late years no educational topic has
                                    been more widely discussed than that as to the proper relations of secondary schools and colleges. As a result, special
                                    examinations for admission to college are either greatly simplified or entirely abolished, and the secondary studies are
                                    much more substantial and better taught than formerly. An increasing proportion of secondary school teachers are college
                                    graduates. The most extraordinary characteristic of secondary education in recent years is the rapid increase in the number
                                    of students taking Latin as a school subject. Meanwhile the proportion of those studying physics and chemistry has fallen
                                    off slightly. The rate of increase in the number of pupils who study Latin is fully twice as great as the rate of increase
                                    in the number of secondary school students. Between 1890 and 1896, while the number of students in private secondary schools
                                    increased 12 %, the number of students in public secondary schools increased 87 %. Since 1894 the number of students in
                                    private secondary schools has steadily declined.</p>

                                    no counterpart in Europe. The college course of study, at first three years in length, was soon extended to four years, and
                                    the classes are uniformly known as the freshman, the sophomore, the junior and the senior. The traditional degree which
                                    crowns the college course is that of Bachelor of Arts (A.B.). The studies ordinarily insisted on in the case of candidates
                                    for this degree are Latin, Greek, mathematics, English, philosophy, political economy, history, at least one modern European
                                    language (French or German), and at least one natural science. The degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of
                                    Philosophy (Ph.B.), and Bachelor of Letters (B.L.) are often conferred by colleges upon students who have pursued systematic
                                    courses of study which do not include Greek or the amount of Latin required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The best
                                    colleges give instruction which is similar in character to that given in Germany in the three upper classes of the gymnasium
                                    and in the introductory courses at the universities, in France in the two upper classes of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">lycée</foreign> and in the first two years of university study, and in England in the upper form of the public schools
                                    and during the years of undergraduate residence at <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>. Since 1870 the colleges have developed
                                    enormously. Their resources have multiplied, the number of their students has increased by leaps and bounds, the programme
                                    of studies has broadened and deepened, the standards have been raised, and the efficiency of the instruction has greatly
                                    increased. Rigidly prescribed courses of study have given way to elective courses, and a knowledge of Greek is no longer
                                    required for the degree of A.B. at such influential colleges as <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_College">Harvard</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbia_University">Columbia</name>, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cornell_University">Cornell</name> and <name type="institution">Williams</name>

                                        http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Williams_University). – Alexey Gorobiy</note>. A strong effort is being made to have
                                    the leading colleges give but one degree, that of Bachelor of Arts, and to confer that upon those who complete any
                                    substantial course of college studies. A marked change has taken place in the attitude of the college authorities toward the
                                    students. In 1870 the college president was a paterfamilias. He knew each student and came into direct personal contact with
                                    him. The president and the faculty had supervision not only of the studies of the students, but of their moral and religious
                                    life as well. The older type of college professor was not always a great scholar, but he was a student of human nature, with
                                    keen intuitions and shrewd insight. The new type, which had come into existence at the opening of the 20th century, was more
                                    scholarly in some special direction, often regarded teaching as a check upon opportunities for investigation, and disdained
                                    troubling himself with a student's personal concerns or intellectual and moral difficulties. The change was not altogether

                                    exercises a helpful local influence. Ninety per cent of all college students attend an institution not more than one hundred
                                    miles from their own homes. Few colleges have a national constituency, and even in these cases an overwhelming preponderance
                                    of the students come from the immediate neighbourhood. This explains, in a measure, the powerful influence which the college
                                    has exercised in the life of the nation. While hardly more than one in a hundred of the white male youth of the country has
                                    had a college education, yet the college graduates have furnished one-half of all the presidents of the United States, most
                                    of the justices of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">the Supreme
                                        Court</name>, about one-half of the cabinet officers and United States senators, and nearly one-third of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">the House of
                                        Representatives</name>. Before the Revolution eleven colleges were founded. From 1776 to 1800, twelve more were added ;
                                    from 1800 to 1830, thirty-three ; from 1830 to 1865, one hundred and eighty ; from 1865 to 1898, two hundred and thirty-six.
                                    Their standards, efficiency and equipment are very diverse, many of the so-called colleges being less effective than some of

                                <p>In the United States the title <q>" university "</q> is used indiscriminately of institutions which are in reality
                                    universities, of institutions which are colleges, and of institutions which are so ill-equipped as not to take rank with
                                    good secondary schools. Only time and a greatly increased capacity to distinguish the various types of higher schools will
                                    remedy this error. Putting aside tentative and unsuccessful attempts to develop genuine university instruction much earlier,
                                    it may safely be said that the opening of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johns_Hopkins_University">Johns Hopkins University</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baltimore">Baltimore</name> in 1876 began the present movement to organize carefully
                                    advanced study and research, requiring a college education of those who wish to enter upon it. This is university
                                    instruction properly so called, and though found elsewhere, it is given chiefly at fourteen institutions: <name type="institution">California University</name>

                                        of America</name>, are also colleges. The combination of collegiate and university instruction under one corporation and
                                    one executive administration is distinctive of higher education in the United States, and its chief source of strength. The
                                    crowning honour of the university student is the degree of Ph.D., although that of A.M.—obtainable in less time and much
                                    easier conditions—is also sought. The minimum period of study accepted for the degree of Ph.D. is two years after obtaining
                                    the bachelor's degree; but in practice, three, and even four, years of study are found necessary. In addition to carrying on
                                    an investigation in the field of his main subject of study, the candidate for the degree of Ph.D. is usually required to
                                    pass examinations on one or two subordinate subjects, to possess a reading knowledge of French and German (often of Latin as
                                    well), and to submit—usually in printed form—the dissertation which embodies the results of his researches. The methods of
                                    instruction in the universities are the lecture, discussion and work in laboratory or seminary—the latter transplanted from
                                    the German universities. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon students who, after one year of university residence
                                    and study, pass certain prescribed examinations. This degree, like those of D.D., S.T.D. and L.L.D., is often conferred by
                                    colleges and universities as a purely honorary distinction. The degree of Ph.D. is not so conferred any longer by the best
                                    universities. Not a few of the universities maintain schools of law and medicine. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_University">Harvard</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yale_University">Yale</name> universities maintain schools of theology as well. The
                                    learned publications issued by the universities, or under the direction of university professors, are of great importance,
                                    and constitute an imposing body of scientific literature. The national and state governments make increasing use of
                                    university officials for public service requiring special training or expert knowledge. In 1871-1872 there were only 198
                                    resident graduate (or university) students in the United States. In 1887 this number had risen to 1237, and in 1897 to 4392.
                                    These figures are exclusive of professional students, and include only those who are studying in what would be called, in

                                            Columbia University</name>, there summarizes the national account as follows :— <quote>"We use in formal school
                                            education a material plant valued at from twelve to thirteen hundred million dollars, the labour of 550,000 teachers
                                            or other educational officers, and more or less of the time of some eighteen million students ... We pay for the
                                            labour of those teachers, many of whom work for only part of the normal cityschool year, about $300,000,000. We pay
                                            for fuel, light, janitorial services, repairs, depreciation of books, school supplies, insurance and the like, about
                                            $90,000,000. For depreciation of the plant not so charged we should properly provide during the year a sinking fund
                                            of perhaps $25,000,000. Adding an interest charge of 5 % on the investment in the plant, our annual bill for formal
                                            school education comes to over $475.000,000. Additions to the plant were made [in 1906-1907] to the extent of from
                                            ninety to a hundred million dollars. As a partial estimate of the returns from this investment we may take the
                                            number of students whose education has been carried to a specified standard of accomplishment and power. Thus I
                                            estimate that, in 1907, 3000 students reached the standard denoted by three years or more of academic, technical or
                                            professional study in advance of a reputable college degree ; that 25,000 students reached the standard denoted by
                                            at least three and not over four years of such study in advance of a four-year high-school course; that an eighth of
                                            a million students reached the standard denoted by at least three and not over four years of study in advance of an
                                            eight-year elementary-school course; and that three-quarters of a million students reached the standard of
                                            completion of an elementary school course of seven or eight years or its equivalent ... Roughly, nine-tenths of
                                            elementary education and the education of teachers, over two-thirds of secondary education, and over a third of
                                            college and higher technical education are provided and controlled by the public. Professional education, other than
                                            the training of teachers and engineers, is still largely a function of private provision and control. " The
                                            following rough comparison may serve to define further the status of education in the country at large. The plant
                                            used for formal education is valued at 1 % of our entire national wealth, or twice the value of our telephone
                                            systems, or ten times the value of our Pullman and private cars, or one-tenth the value of our railroads. The number
                                            of teachers is approximately that of the clergymen, engineers, lawyers and physicians together, five times that of
                                            the regular army and navy, and about twice that of the saloon-keepers and bar-tenders and their assistants. The
                                            annual expenditure for education, exclusive of additions to the plant, is somewhat over twice the expenditure for
                                            the war and navy departments of the national government. It is three and a half times the expenditure of the
                                            national government in 1907 for pensions. It is about one and a fourth times the cost (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> wholesale prices) of the sugar and coffee we
                                            consume annually."</quote>

                            <p>It has justly become a commonplace of geography to describe Europe as a mere peninsula of Asia, but while it is necessary to bear
                                this in mind in some aspects of the geography of the continent, more particularly in relation to the climate, the individuality
                                of the continent is established in the clearest manner by the course of history and the resultant distribution of population.
                                The earliest mention of Europe is in the Homeric <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homeric_Hymns">

The distinction between Europe and Asia is found, however,
                                in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aeschylus">Aeschylus</name> in the 5th century B.C, but there seems to

                                names of Asia and Europe. Where the names originated the geographical distinction was clearly marked by the intervention of the
                                sea, and this intervention marked equally clearly the distinction between Europe and Libya (Africa). As the knowledge of the
                                world extended, the difficulty, which still exists, of fixing the boundary between Europe and Asia where there is land
                                connexion, caused uncertainty in the application of the two names, but never obscured the necessity for recognizing the
                                distinction. Even in the 3rd century B.C. Europe was regarded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</name> as including all that was then known of northern Asia.
                                But the character of the physical features and climate finally determined the fact that what we know as Europe came to be
                                occupied by more or less populous countries in intimate relation with one another, but separated on the east by unpeopled or
                                very sparsely peopled areas from the countries of Asia, and the boundary between the two continents has long been recognized as
                                running somewhere through this area. Within the limits thus marked out on the east and on other sides by the sea <quote>" the
                                    climatic conditions are such that inhabitants are capable of and require a civilization of essentially the same type, based

                                the upper end of the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea, nearly parallel to the Caucasus. Various limits are assigned to the
                                continent on the east. Officially the crest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus">the Caucasus</name>
                                and that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">the Urals</name> are regarded in Russia as the

                                forward by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermann_Wagner_(geographer)">Wagner</name>, that from time
                                immemorial the valleys on both sides of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus">the Caucasus</name> have
                                formed a refuge for Asiatic peoples, especially when it is borne in mind that this contention is reinforced by the circumstance
                                that the steppes to the north of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caucasus">the Caucasus</name> must
                                interpose a belt of almost unpeopled territory between the more condensed populations belonging undoubtedly to Asia and Europe
                                respectively. Continuity of population would be an argument in favour of assigning the whole of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">the Urals</name> to Europe, but here the absence of any break in such
                                continuity on the east side makes it more difficult to fix any boundary line outside of that system. Hence on this side it is
                                perhaps reasonable to attach greater importance to the fact that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">the Urals</name> form a boundary not only orographically, but to some

                            <p>Two of the most striking features in the general conformation of Europe are the great number of its primary and secondary
                                peninsulas, and the consequent exceptional development of its coast-line—an irregularity and development which have been one of
                                the most potent of the physical factors of its history. The total length of coast-line was estimated by <name type="person">Reuschle</name> in 1869 at 19,820 m., of which about 3600 were counted as belonging to the Arctic Ocean, 8390 to the
                                Atlantic, and 7830 to the Black Sea and Mediterranean. This estimate, however, does not take into account minor indentations.

                                indentations, brings the coast-line up to 26,700 m., and that of <name type="person">Strelbitsky</name> up to 47,790 m. (smaller
                                islands not included), or 1 m. of coast for about 75 sq. m. of area. <name type="person">Rohrbach</name>

                                pointed out, however, that such calculations are apt to be very misleading, inasmuch as the commercial value of the relations
                                thus determined depends not merely on the existence of natural harbours or the presence of facilities for the construction of
                                artificial harbours, but also on the presence of natural facilities for communication between such harbours and a productive

                            <p>The consideration just mentioned gives great significance to the fact that while the coast-line of Europe is in its general
                                features very much the same as it was at the beginning of the true historic period, it has undergone a number of important local
                                changes, some at least of which are due to causes that are at work over very extensive areas. These changes may be conveniently
                                classified under four heads: the formation of deltas by the alluvium of rivers; the increase of the land-surface due to
                                upheaval; the advance of the sea by reason of its own erosive activity; and the advance of the sea through the subsidence of the
                                land. The actual form of the coast, however, is frequently due to the simultaneous or successive action of several of the
                                causes—sea and river and subterranean forces helping or resisting each other. That changes in the coast-line on the shores of
                                the Gulf of Bothnia have taken place within historical times through elevation of the land seems now to be generally admitted.
                                The commune of Hvittisbofjärd north of Björneborg on the Finland side of that gulf gained about 2 1/4 sq. m. between 1784 and
                                1894, an amount greater than could be accounted for by the most liberal estimates of alluvial deposit, and the most careful
                                investigation seems to show that on the Swedish coast of that gulf a rise has taken place in recent years on the east coast of
                                Sweden from about 57° 20' N. increasing in amount towards the north up to 62º 20' N., where it reaches an average of about
                                two-fifths of an inch annually. <note>See <bibl>

                                There we find that all the great rivers have been successfully at work—more especially the Rhone, the Ebro and the Po. The
                                activity of the Rhone, indeed, as a maker of new land, is astonishing. The tower of St Louis, erected on the coast in 1737, is
                                now upwards of four miles inland; the city of Arles is said to be nearly twice as far from the sea as it was in the Roman
                                period. The present St Gilles was probably a harbour when the Greeks founded Marseilles, and Aigues Mortes, which took its place

                                time of St Louis (13th century), but Narbonne continued to be a seaport till the 14th century. At the mouth of the Hérault,

                                great labour to keep the harbour of Cette from being silted up. The Po is even more efficient than the Rhone, if the size of its
                                basin be taken into account. Ravenna, which was at one time an insular city like Venice, has now a wide stretch of downs partly
                                covered with pine forest between it and the sea. Aquileia, one of the greatest seaports of the Mediterranean in the early
                                centuries of the Christian era, is now 7 m. from the coast, and Adria, which gives its name to the sea, is 13. The islands on
                                which Venice is built have sunk about 3 ft. since the 16th century: the pavement of the square of St Mark's has frequently
                                required to be raised, and the boring of a well has shown that a layer of vegetable remains, indicating a flora identical with
                                that observed at present on the neighbouring mainland, exists at a depth of 400 ft. below the alluvial deposits. A little to the

                                district at the mouth of the Narenta has been changed into a swamp by the advance of the sea. A process of elevation, on the
                                other hand, is indicated along nearly all the coasts of Sicily, at the southern end of Sardinia, the east of Corsica, and
                                perhaps in the neighbourhood of Nice, while the west coast of Italy from the latitude of Rome to the southern shores of the Gulf
                                of Salerno has undergone considerable oscillations of level within historical times. About the time of the settlement of the
                                Greeks the coast stood at least 20 ft. above the level of the present day. Depression began in Roman times though then the land
                                was still 16 ft. higher than now. A more rapid depression began in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>, so that the sea-level rose from 18 to 20 ft. above the
                                present zero, and the coast began gradually to rise again at the close of the 15th century.<note>See <bibl>

                                Greece; but as they are only repetitions on a smaller scale of the phenomena already described, it is sufficient to indicate the
                                Gulf of Arta and the mouth of the Spercheios as two of the more important localities. The latter especially is interesting to
                                the historian as well as to the geologist, as the river has greatly altered the physical features of one of the world's most
                                famous scenes—the battlefield of Thermopylae.</p>
                            <p>If we proceed to the Atlantic seaboard we observe, as we might expect, great modifications in the embouchures of the Garonne and
                                the Loire, but by far the most remarkable variations of sea and land have taken place in the region extending from the south of
                                Belgium in the neighbourhood of the Straits of Dover to the mouth of the Elbe and the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein. Here
                                there has been a prolonged struggle between man and nature, in which on the whole nature has hitherto had the best of the
                                battle. While, as is well known, much land below sea-level in the Low Countries has been protected against the sea by dikes and
                                reclaimed, and the coast-line has been, on the whole, advanced between the Elbe and the Eider,<note>See <bibl>

                                beginning of the Christian era, and on the balance a large loss of land north of the Eider since the first half of the 13th
                                century. <note>

                                </note> In the 1st century A.D. the Zuider Zee appears to have been
                                represented only by a comparatively small inland lake, the dimensions of which were increased by different inroads of the sea,
                                the last and greatest of which occurred in 1395. Among the local changes of European significance within this area may be
                                mentioned the silting up towards the end of the 15th century of the channel known as the Zwin running north-eastwards from
                                Bruges, which through that cause lost its shipping and in the end all its former renown as a seat of commerce.</p>
                            <p>The Baltic shores of Germany display the same phenomena of local gain and loss. In the western section inroads of the sea have
                                been extensive: the island of Rügen would no longer serve for the disembarkation of an army like that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustavus_Adolphus_of_Sweden">Gustavus Adolphus</name> ; Wollin and Usedom are growing
                                gradually less; large stretches of the mainland are fringed with submerged forests ; and at intervals the sites of well-known
                                villages are occupied by the sea. Towards the east the great rivers are successfully working in the opposite direction. In the
                                Gulf of Danzig the alluvial deposits of the Vistula cover an area of 615 sq. m . ; in the 13th century the knights of Marienburg
                                enclosed with dikes about 350 sq. m.: and an area of about 70 sq. m. was added in the course of the 14th. The Memel is silting
                                up the Kurisches Haff, which, like the Frisches Haff is separated from the open sea by a line of dunes comparable with those of
                                the Landes in France. The so-called strand or coast-lines at various altitudes round the Scandinavian peninsula, though
                                belonging for the most part to glacial times, speak also of relative changes of level in the post-glacial period.</p>

                                the great outlying <q>" hearth "</q> of Iceland, there are four centres of volcanic activity in Europe- all of them, however,

                                attracted particular attention since the 18th century. It lies m the Archipelago, on the southern edge of the Cyclades, near the
                                little group of islets called Santonn. The region was evidently highly volcanic at an earlier period, for Milo, one of the
                                nearest of the islands, is simply a ruined crater still presenting smoking solfataras and other traces of former activity. The
                                devastations produced by the eruptions of the European volcanoes are usually confined within very narrow limits; and it is only
                                at long intervals that any part of the continent is visited by a really formidable earthquake. The only part of Europe, however,
                                for which there are no recorded earthquakes is central and northern Russia; and the Alps and Carpathians, especially the
                                intra-Carpathian area of depression, Greece, Italy, especially Calabria and the adjoining part of Sicily, the Sierra Nevada and
                                the Pyrenees, the Lisbon district and the rift valley of the upper Rhine (between the Vosges and the Black Forest) are all
                                regions specially liable to earthquake shocks and occasionally to shocks of considerable intensity. One well-marked seismic line
                                extends along the south side of the Alps from Lake Garda by Udine and Gorz to Fiume, and another forms a curve convex towards
                                the south-east passing first through Calabria, then through the north-east of Sicily to the south of the Peloritan

                                1755, and that of Calabria in 1783; the devastation produced by the former has become a classical instance of such disasters in
                                popular literature, and by the latter 100,000 people are said to have lost their lives. Calabria again suffered severely in
                                1865, 1870, 1894, 1905 and 1908.</p>

                                    <item>(2) the fact that the principal series of highlands has a direction from east to west, Europe in this point resembling

                                </list>. The first and second of these points have special importance with reference to the climate and will accordingly be
                                considered more fully under that head. The second is also of importance with reference to the means of communication, to which
                                the third also refers, and detailed consideration of these points in that relation will be reserved for that heading. Here,
                                however, it may be noted that in Europe the distribution of the natural resources for the maintenance of the inhabitants is such
                                that, if we leave out of account Russia, which is almost entirely outside of the series of highlands running east and west, the
                                population north of the mountains is roughly about 50 % greater than that south of the mountains, whereas in Asia the population
                                north of the east and west highland barrier is utterly insignificant as compared with that to the south.</p>
                            <p>From the table given on p. 909 (col. 1) it will be seen that the most extensive of the highland areas of Europe is that of
                                Scandinavia, which has a general trend from south-south-west to north-north-east, and is completely detached by seas and plains
                                from the highland area to the south. There are other completely detached highland areas in Iceland, the British Isles, the Ural
                                Mountains, the small Yaila range in the south of the Crimea, and the Mediterranean islands. The connected series of highlands is
                                that which extends from the Iberian peninsula to the Black Sea stretching in the middle of Germany northwards to about 52° N. In
                                the Iberian peninsula we have the most marked example of the tableland form in Europe, and these tablelands are bounded on the
                                north by the Cantabrian Mountains, which descend to the sea, and the Pyrenees, which, except at their extremities, cut off the
                                Iberian peninsula from the adjoining country more extensively than any other chain in the continent. Between the foot-hills of
                                the Pyrenees, however, and those of the central plateau of France the ground sinks in the Passage of Naurouse or Gap of
                                Carcassonne to a well-marked gap establishing easy communication between the valley of the Garonne and the lower part of that of
                                the Rhone. The highlands in the north spread northwards and then north-castwards till they join the Vosges, but sink in
                                elevation towards the north-east so as to allow of several easy crossings. East of the Vosges the Rhine valley forms an
                                important trough running north and south through the highlands of western Germany. To the south of the Vosges again undulating
                                country of less than 1500 ft. in elevation, the well-known Burgundy Gate or Gap of Belfort, constitutes a well-marked break
                                between those mountains and the Jura, and establishes easy communication between the Rhine and the Saône-Rhone valleys. The
                                latter valley divides in the clearest manner the highlands of central France from both the Alps and the Jura, while between
                                these last two systems there lies the wedge of the Swiss midlands contracting southwestwards to a narrow but important gap at
                                the outlet of the Lake of Geneva. Between the Alps and the mountains of the Italian and Balkan peninsulas the orographical lines
                                of demarcation are less distinct, but on the north the valley of the Danube mostly forms a wide separation between the Alps and
                                the mountains of the Balkan peninsula on the south and the highlands of Bohemia and Moravia, the Carpathians and the
                                Transylvanian Alps on the north. The valleys of the Eger and the Elbe form distinct breaks in the environment of Bohemia, and
                                the Sudetes on the north-east of Bohemia and Moravia are even more clearly divided from the Carpathians by the valley of the
                                upper Oder, the Moravian Gate, as it is called, which forms the natural line of communication between the south-east of Prussia
                                and Vienna.</p>

                                principal rivers of Europe. In the table on p. 909 all the estimates given without any special authority are based on <name type="person">Strelbitsky</name>'s figures, but it should be mentioned that the estimates of length made by him evidently do
                                not take into account minor windings, and are therefore generally less than those given by others. The authorities are
                                separately cited for the originals of all other figures given in the table. <note>In other parts of this work areas of
                                    river-basins and lakes, and other measurements, may be observed to conflict in some degree with those given here. Various
                                    authorities naturally differ, both in methods of estimating and in standards of precision.</note>

                                </note> He finds that the dominant factor in determining that temperature is the temperature of the air
                                above, but that rivers are divisible into four groups with respect to the relation between these temperatures at different
                                seasons of the year. These groups are rivers flowing from glaciers, in which the temperature is warmer than the air in winter,
                                colder in summer; rivers flowing from lakes, characterized by peculiarly high winter temperatures, in consequence of which the
                                mean temperature for the year is always above that of the air ; rivers flowing from springs, which, at least near their source,
                                are more rapidly cooled by low than warmed by high air temperatures; and rivers of the plains, which have a higher mean
                                temperature than the air in all months of the year.</p>
                            <p>In various parts of Europe, more particularly in calcareous regions, such as the Jura, the Causses in the south-east of France,
                                and the Karst in the north-west of the Balkan peninsula, there are numerous subterranean or partly subterranean rivers. Several
                                of the more important rivers are of very irregular flow, and some are subject to really formidable floods. This is particularly
                                the case with rivers a large part of whose basin is made up of crystalline or other impervious rocks with steep slopes, like
                                those of the Loire in France and the Ebro in Spain. The Danube and its tributaries, the great rivers of Germany, above all
                                eastern Germany, and those of Italy, are also <table rows="41" cols="6">

                            <p>The Alpine lakes break up into a southern and northern subdivision— the former consisting of the Lago Maggiore, and the lakes of
                                Lugano and Como, Lago d'Iseo, and Lago di Garda, all connected by affluents with the system of the Po; and the latter the Lake
                                of Geneva threaded by the Rhone, Lakes Constance, Zürich, Neuchâtel, Biel and other Swiss lakes belonging to the basin of the
                                Rhine, and a few of minor importance belonging to the Danube. The north Russian lakes, Ladoga, Onega, etc, are mainly noticeable
                                as the largest members of what in some respects is the most remarkable system of lakes in the continent—the Finno-Russian, which
                                consists of an almost countless number of comparatively small irregular basins formed in the surface of a granitic plateau. In
                                Finland proper they occupy no less than a twelfth of the total area.</p>
                            <p>A few of the number are very shallow. The Neusiedler See, for example (the Peiso Lacus of the Latins and Ferto-tava of the
                                Hungarians), completely dried up in 1693, 1738 and 1864, and left its bed covered for the most part with a deposit of

                                chains. Four times a great mountain range has been raised across the area which now is Europe. Three times the mountain range
                                has given way; portions have sunk beneath the sea, and have been covered by more recent sediments, while other portions remained
                                standing and now rise as isolated blocks above the later beds which surround them. The last of the mountain ranges still stands,
                                and is known under the names of the Alps, the Carpathians, the Balkans, the Caucasus, etc, but the work of destruction has
                                already begun, and gaps have been formed by the collapse of parts of the chain. The Carpathians were once continuous with the
                                Alps, and the Caucasus was probably connected with the Balkans across the site of the Black Sea.</p>
                            <p>These mountain chains were not raised by direct uplift. They consist of crumpled and folded strata, and are, in fact, wrinkles in
                                the earth's outer crust, formed by lateral compression, like the puckers which appear in a tablecloth when we push it forward
                                against a book or other heavy object lying upon it. How the lateral or tangential pressures originated is still matter of
                                controversy, but the usually accepted explanation is as follows. The interior of the earth in cooling contracts more rapidly
                                than the exterior, and, if no other change took place, the outer crust would be left as a hollow sphere without any internal
                                support. But the materials of which it is composed are not strong enough to bear its enormous weight, and, like an arch which is
                                too weak in its abutments, it collapses upon the interior core. Where the crust is rigid it fractures, as an ordinary arch would
                                fracture ; and some portions fall inward, while other parts may even be wedged a little outward. Where, on the other hand, the
                                crust is made of softer rock, it crumples and folds, and a mountain chain is produced. Such a mountain chain, for want of a
                                better term, is called a folded mountain chain. The folding is most intense where a flexible portion of the crust lies next to a
                                more rigid part. Where the folding has occurred, the rocks which were once comparatively soft become hard and rigid, and the
                                next series of wrinkles will usually be formed beyond the limits of the old one. This is what has happened in the European
                                area.</p>
                            <p>The oldest mountain chain lay in the extreme north-west of Europe, and its relics are seen in the outer Hebrides, the Lofoten
                                Islands and the north of Norway. The rocks of this ancient chain have since been converted into gneiss, and they were folded and
                                denuded before the deposition of the oldest known fossiliferous sediments. The mountain system must therefore have been formed
                                in Pre-Cambrian times, and it has been called by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcel_Alexandre_Bertrand">Marcel Bertrand</name> the Huronian chain. It is probable that a great land-mass lay towards the north-west; but in the sea
                                which certainly existed south-east of the chain, the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian beds were deposited. In Russia and South
                                Sweden these beds still lie flat and undisturbed; but in Norway, Scotland, the Lake District, North Wales and the north of
                                Ireland they were crushed against the north-western continent and were not only intensely folded but were pushed forward over
                                the old rocks of the Huronian chain. Thus was formed the Caledonian mountain system of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Ed. Suess</name>, in which the folds run from south-west to north-east. It
                                was raised at the close of the Silurian period.</p>
                            <p>Then followed, in northern Europe, a continental period. By the elevation of the Caledonian chain the northern land-mass had
                                grown southward and now extended as far as the Bristol Channel. Upon it the Old Red Sandstone was laid down in inland seas or
                                lakes, while farther south contemporaneous deposits were formed in tho open sea.</p>
                            <p>During the earlier part of the Carboniferous period the sea spread over the southern shores of the northern continent; but later
                                the whole area again became land and the Coal Measures of northern Europe were laid down. Towards the close of the Carboniferous
                                period the third great mountain chain was formed. It lay to the south of the Caledonian chain, and its northern margin stretched
                                from the south of Ireland through South Wales, the north of France and the south of Belgium, and was continued round the Harz
                                and the ancient rocks of Bohemia, and possibly into the south of Russia. It is along this northern margin, where the folded beds
                                have been thrust over the rocks which lay to the north, that the coalfields of Dover and of Belgium occur. The general direction
                                of the folds is approximately from west to east; but the chain consisted of two arcs, the western of which is called by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name> the Armorican chain and the eastern the Variscian.
                                The two arcs together, which were undoubtedly formed at the same period, have been named by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marcel_Alexandre_Bertrand">Bertrand</name> the Hercynian chain. Everywhere the chief
                                folding seems to have occurred before the deposition of the highest beds of the Upper Carboniferous, which lie unconformably
                                upon the folded older beds. The Hercynian chain appears to have been of considerable breadth, at least in western Europe, for
                                the Palaeozoic rocks of Spain and Portugal are thrown into folds which have the same general direction and which were formed at
                                approximately the same period. In eastern Europe the evidence is less complete, because the Hercynian folds are buried beneath
                                more recent deposits and have in some cases been masked by the superposition of a later series of folds.</p>
                            <p>The formation of this Carboniferous range was followed in northern Europe by a second continental period somewhat similar to that
                                of the Old Red Sandstone, but the continent extended still farther to the south. The Permian and Triassic deposits of England
                                and Germany were laid down in inland seas or upon the surface of the land itself. But southern Europe was covered by the open
                                sea, and here, accordingly, the contemporaneous deposits were marine.</p>
                            <p>The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were free from any violent folding or mountain building, and the sea again spread over a
                                large part of the northern continent. There were indeed several oscillations, but in general the greater part of southern and
                                central Europe lay beneath the waters of the ocean. Some of the fragments of the Hercynian chain still rose as islands above the
                                waves, and at certain periods there seems to have been a more or less complete barrier between the waters which covered northern
                                Europe and those which lay over the Mediterranean region. Thus, while the estuarine deposits of the Upper Jurassic and Lower
                                Cretaceous were laid down in England and Germany, the purely marine Tithonian formation, with its peculiar fauna, was deposited
                                in the south ; and while the Chalk was formed in northern Europe, the Hippurite limestone was laid down in the south.</p>
                            <p>The Tertiary period saw fundamental changes in the geography of Europe. The formation of the great mountain ranges of the south,
                                the Alpine system of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name>, perhaps began at an
                                earlier date, but it was in the Eocene and Miocene periods that the chief part of the elevation took place. Arms of the sea
                                extended up the valley of the Rhone and around the northern margin of the Alps, and also spread over the plains of Hungary and
                                of southern Russia. Towards the middle of the Miocene period some of these arms were completely cut off from the ocean and large
                                deposits of salt were formed, as at Wieliczka. At a later period south-eastern Europe was covered by a series of extensive
                                lagoons, and the waters of these lagoons gradually became brackish, and then fresh, before the area was finally converted into
                                dry land. Great changes also took place in the Mediterranean region. The Black Sea, the Aegean, the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian
                                Sea were all formed at various times during the Tertiary period, and the depression of these areas seems to be closely connected
                                with the elevation of the neighbouring mountain chains.</p>
                            <p>Exactly what was happening in northern Europe during these great changes in the south it is not easy to say. The basaltic flows
                                of the north of Ireland, the western islands of Scotland, the Faeroe Islands and Iceland are mere fragments of former extensive
                                plateaus. No sign of marine Tertiary deposits of earlier age than Pliocene has been found in this northern part of Europe, and
                                on the other hand plant remains are abundant in the sands and clays interbedded with the basalts. It is probable, therefore,
                                that in Eocene times a great land-mass lay to the north-west of Europe, over which the basalt lavas flowed, and that the
                                formation of this part of the Atlantic and perhaps of the North Sea did not take place until the Miocene period.</p>
                            <p>At a later date the climate, for some reason which has not yet been fully explained, grew colder over the whole of Europe, and
                                the northern part was covered by a great ice-sheet which extended southward nearly as far as lat. 50º N., and has left its marks
                                over the <pb n="912" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0912.png"/> whole of the northern part of the continent. With the final melting and disappearance of the ice-sheet,
                                the topography of Europe assumed nearly its present form, and man came upon the scene. Minor changes, such as the separation of
                                Great Britain from the continent, may have occurred at a later date ; but since the Glacial period there have, apparently, been
                                no fundamental modifications in the configuration of Europe.</p>
                            <p>The elevation of each of the great mountain systems already described was accompanied by extensive eruptions of volcanic rocks,
                                and the sequence appears to have been similar in every case. The volcanoes of the Mediterranean are the last survivors of the
                                great eruptions which accompanied the elevation of the Alpine mountain system.</p>

                                local winds the most remarkable are the föhn, in the Alps, distinguished for its warmth and dryness ; the Rotenturm wind of
                                Transylvania, which has similar characteristics ; the bora of the Upper Adriatic, so noticeable for its violence ; the mistral
                                of southern France ; the etesian winds of the Mediterranean ; and the sirocco, which proves so destructive to the southern
                                vegetation. Though it is only at comparatively rare intervals that the winds attain the development of a hurricane, the
                                destruction of life and property which they occasion, both by sea and land, is in the aggregate of no small moment. About six or
                                seven storms from the west pass over the continent every winter, usually appearing later in the southern districts, such as
                                Switzerland or the Adriatic, than in the northern districts, as Scotland and Denmark.</p>

                            <p>The great determining factors of the climate of Europe are these. The northern borders of the continent are within the Arctic
                                Circle ; the most southern points of the mainland are 13 1/2° or more north of the Tropic of Cancer ; to the east extends for
                                about 3000 m. the continuous land surface of Asia ; to the west lie the waters of the north Atlantic, which penetrate in great
                                inland seas to the north and south of the great European peninsula ; the prevailing winds in western Europe as already stated
                                are more or less south-westerly ; and the arrangement of the highlands is such as to allow of the penetration of winds with a
                                westerly element in their direction far to the east. The first two of these factors are not distinguishing influences. They
                                affect the climate of Europe in the same manner as they do that of any other land surface in the same latitudes.</p>
                            <p>The remaining factors, however, are of the highest importance. It is to them in fact that Europe owes in a very large measure
                                those physical conditions which are the basis of its recognition as a separate continent. In estimating the value of those
                                factors one must bear in mind, first, that the waters of the north Atlantic are exceptionally warm, especially on the European
                                side of the ocean. The Gulf Stream carries a large body of warm water northwards to near the parallel of 40º N., and to the
                                north of the Gulf Stream prevailing south-westerly winds, especially during the winter months, drift onwards to the western and
                                northern shores of Europe, even as far east as Spitsbergen, large bodies of water of an exceptionally high temperature.
                                Secondly, one must bear in mind that these relatively high temperatures over the ocean promote evaporation and thus favour the
                                presence of a relatively large amount of water-vapour in the air over those parts of the ocean which adjoin the continent; and,
                                thirdly, that, as the winds are the sole means of carrying water-vapour from one part of the earth's surface to the other, and
                                the sole means of carrying heat and cold from the ocean to the land, the prevailing south-westerly winds are allowed by the
                                superficial configuration to bring a relatively high rainfall and a relatively large amount of heat in winter to land farther in
                                the interior than in any corresponding latitudes. During the summer the winds referred to have a cooling effect, but not to the
                                same degree as those of winter tend to raise the temperature. From the point of view just indicated the only part of the world
                                that is fairly comparable with Europe is the west of North America ; but, as there the outline and superficial configuration are
                                quite different, the oceanic influences affect only a narrow strip of seaboard and not any extent of land which could be
                                regarded as of continental rank. It is owing to these influences that in the greater part of Europe there is a more or less
                                continuous population dependent on agriculture. On the east side of Europe, again, the existence of the continent of Asia has a
                                marked effect on the climate which also aids in giving to Europe its individual character. It is owing to that circumstance that
                                the south-east of the continent, which has temperatures as favourable to agriculture as the corresponding latitudes of eastern
                                Asia or eastern North America, is without the copious rains which make those temperatures so valuable, and hence forms part of
                                the desert that divides the populations of Europe and Asia.</p>

                            <p>On the local distribution of rainfall and temperature, the physical configuration of the continent has very marked effects. Here
                                as elsewhere there is a striking difference both in the amount of rainfall and the temperature on the weather and lee sides of
                                mountains and even low hills. But with reference to this it should not be forgotten that water-vapour, heat and cold may be
                                carried farther into the land by winds blowing in a different direction from that of those by which they were introduced from
                                the ocean, and, with reference to rainfall, that the condensation of water-vapour may be brought out by different winds from
                                those by which the water-vapour was brought to the area in which it is condensed. Water-vapour that may have been introduced by
                                a south-westerly wind may be driven against a mountain side by a northerly or easterly wind, and thus cause rain on the northern
                                or eastern side of the mountain. Still, any rainfall map of Europe indicates clearly enough the origin of the water-vapour to
                                which the rainfall is due. Such a map, taking into account the results of more detailed investigations of different parts of the

                                intervals of 250 mm. (about 10 in.) up to 1000 mm., and beyond that at intervals of 500 mm. up to 2000 mm. In some parts of the
                                continent the limits of a rainfall of 200 mm. and 600 mm. are also shown. The picture there given is too complicated for brief
                                description except by saying quite generally that it shows on the whole a diminution in the total amount of precipitation from
                                west to east, and that the heaviest precipitation is indicated on the west or south and most exposed sides of mountains. The
                                areas of scantiest rainfall lie to the north and north-west of the Caspian Sea and in the interior of the Kola Peninsula,
                                northwest of the White Sea. The Stye in the English Lake District, some 2 m. from and 650 ft. higher than Seathwaite, has long
                                been reputed to be the station recording the heaviest rainfall in Europe, but it has been shown to have a rival in Crkvice, a
                                station immediately to the north of the Bocche di Cattaro on the Dalmatian coast. In the period 1881-1890 the average rainfall
                                at the Stye amounted to 177 in., in 1891-1900 that at Crkvice amounted to about 179 in. <note>See a paper on <bibl>

                                climatological element. So far, however, the only European country in which a record of the snowfall is kept is Russia, but it
                                may be pointed out that the scantiness of the winter precipitation and accordingly of snow in the south-east of Europe almost
                                entirely prevents the cultivation of winter wheat, which is thus left without the protective blanket enjoyed in some other parts
                                of the world with cold winters.</p>

                                    of memoirs in which the rainfall observations of Europe for the thirty years 1861- 1890 are recorded and discussed. The

                                autumn and winter respectively. From the maps it appears that all the southern and western coasts of Europe have a high
                                proportion of rain in autumn, and that this is true also of the whole of the Italian peninsula and the islands of the western
                                half of the Mediterranean, of all the south-west of the Balkan peninsula, including the Peloponnesus, of the Saône-Rhone valley
                                and both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia, and that a high winter rainfall is characteristic of Iceland, the extreme western coasts
                                of Scotland, Ireland, France and the Iberian peninsula, as well as of the greater part of the Mediterranean region, but more
                                particularly the south-east, while in this region, and, again more particularly in the south-east, there is a great scarcity of
                                summer rains, which, on the other hand, form the highest percentage in the interior and eastern parts of the continent. If the
                                year be divided into a winter and summer half, the area with a predominance of summer rains begins in the east of Great Britain
                                <pb n="913" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0913.png"/> and extends eastwards, while the Mediterranean region generally is one of rainy winters and relatively dry
                                summers. The consequence is that with similar conditions of soil and superficial configuration the Mediterranean region is
                                agriculturally much less productive, except where there are means of irrigation, than the corresponding latitudes in the east of
                                Asia and the east of North America, where there are corresponding summer temperatures but an opposite seasonal distribution of

                                    <name type="person">Dr Supan</name> in an interesting series of
                                    maps based on actual observations not reduced to sea-level, and showing the duration in months of the periods within which
                                    the mean daily temperature lies within certain ranges (at or below 32º F.; 5O°-68º F.; above 68° F).<note>

                                            <date>(1887)</date>, pl. 10 (text pp. 165-172)</bibl>.</note>
                                </ref> The first of these maps strikingly illustrates
                                the effect on temperature of the strong westerly winds of winter, and, in the south, that of winds from the Mediterranean Sea as
                                well as the protection afforded to the Mediterranean countries against cold winds from the north by the barrier of mountains.
                                South of the parallel of 60° there is no lowland area in the west of Europe where the average daily temperature is at or below
                                the freezing point for as much as one month, and in the Mediterranean region only the higher parts of the mountains besides the
                                northern part of the Balkan Peninsula are characterized by such prolonged frosts. On the other hand, on the parallel of 50º N.
                                the duration of such low temperatures increases at first rapidly, afterwards more gradually, from west to east. The second map
                                illustrating the duration of average daily temperatures between 50º and 68° F., that is, the temperatures favourable to the
                                ordinary vegetation of the temperate zone, shows that the duration of such temperatures increases on the whole from south to
                                north, and that by far the greater part of the continent south of 53° N. has at least six months within those limits, and south
                                of 58º N. at least five months. The third of the maps shows that the high temperatures which it illustrates are prolonged for a
                                month or more throughout the Mediterranean region, but outside of that region hardly anywhere except in the south-western plains
                                of France, the Rhone valley and a large area in the south-east of Russia. Without doubt an important cause of the prolonged
                                duration of high temperatures in this last area is the relatively long duration of sunshine already mentioned as shown by <name type="person">König</name>'s map to be characteristic of south-eastern Europe.</p>
                            <p>Mention should here be made also of <name type="person">Brückner</name>'s remarkable treatise on the variations of climate in
                                time. Though it deals with such variations over the entire land-surface of the globe, a large proportion of the data are derived
                                from Europe, for which continent, accordingly, it furnishes a great number of particulars with regard to secular variations in
                                temperature, rainfall, the date of the vintage, the frequency of cold winters, the level of rivers and lakes, the duration of
                                the ice-free period of rivers (in this case all Russian), and other matters. Those relating to the date of the vintage are of
                                peculiar interest. They apply to 29 stations in France, south-west Germany and Switzerland, and for one station (Dijon) go back
                                with few breaks to the year 1391; and as the variations of climate of which they give an indication correspond precisely to the
                                indications derived from temperature and rainfall in those periods in which we have corresponding data for these meteorological
                                elements, they may be taken as warranting conclusions with regard to these points even for periods for which direct data are
                                wanting. A period of early vintages corresponds to one of comparatively scanty rains and high temperatures. It is accordingly
                                interesting to note that the data referred to indicate, on the whole, for Dijon an earlier vintage for the average of all
                                periods of five years down to 1435 than for the average of the periods of the same length from 1816- 1880; but that the figures
                                generally show no regular retardation from period to period, but more or less regular oscillations, differing in their higher
                                and lower limits in different periods of long duration.</p>

                                south-east of England. Spelt is cultivated in the south-west of Germany, Belgium and northern Switzerland, on the middle Volga
                                and in Dalmatia and Servia. Rye covers more than 50 % of the grain area in the east of Holland and Belgium, in the north-west of
                                Germany, in central and eastern Germany and in middle Russia. Oats are more cultivated than all varieties of wheat in Ireland,
                                in the west and the northern half of Great Britain, in Finland and in the greater part of Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein. Barley
                                is more largely cultivated than oats both in the extreme north and the south of the continent. Maize is cultivated to a great
                                extent in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, in the south-west of France, in northern Italy and in the lands bordering the
                                lower Danube ; in many parts covering an area equal to or greater than that occupied by all grain crops. Millets (various
                                species of panicum) are most extensively cultivated in the south-east of Europe. The kind of millet known as guinea-corn or

                                India, is grown to a small extent on the east side and in the interior of Istria. Buckwheat is cultivated in the west and east
                                of the continent—in the west from the Pyrenees to Jutland, in the east throughout southern and middle Russia. The potato is very
                                largely cultivated in western, northern and central Europe, but has made comparatively little progress in Russia. The
                                cultivation of lentils is most largely pursued in the west and south-west of Germany and in the south and north of France. That
                                of lupines has spread with great rapidity since 1840 in the dry sandy regions of eastern Germany, where lupines have proved as
                                well adapted for such soils as the more widely cultivated sainfoin has done for dry chalky and other limestone soils. Sugar beet
                                is most largely cultivated in the extreme north of France and the adjoining parts of Belgium and in central Germany, to a less
                                but still considerable extent in south-eastern Germany, northern Bohemia and the south-west of Russia. Flax, like other
                                industrial plants, shows a tendency to concentrate itself on specially favourable districts. It is most extensively grown in
                                Russia from the vicinity of Riga north-eastwards, even crossing in the north-east the 70th parallel of latitude; but it is also
                                an important crop in the north-east of Ireland, in Belgium and Holland, in Lombardy and in northern Tirol. Hemp is more
                                extensively cultivated in central and southern Europe, above all in Russia. Teasels are grown in various spots in the south-east
                                of France and in south Germany. The cultivation of madder is not yet extinct in Holland and Belgium, that of weld <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                Christiansund in 63º 7'; but its cultivation is of no importance north of 47 1/2º on the Atlantic coast, 50 1/2° on the Rhine,
                                and from 50° to 52° in eastern Germany, the limit falling rapidly southwards to the east of 17° E. The olive, with its double
                                crop, is one of the principal objects of cultivation in Italy, Spain and Greece, and is not without its importance in Portugal,
                                Turkey and southern Austria. Tobacco is grown to a considerable extent in many parts of western, central and southern Europe,
                                for the most part under government regulation. The most important tobacco districts are the Rhine valley in Baden and Alsace,
                                Hungary, Rumania, the banks of the Dnieper, Bosnia and the south-west and other parts of France. The cultivation is even carried
                                on in Sweden and Great Britain, but the most northerly area in which it occupies as much as 0.1 % of the grain area is the
                                Danish island of Fyen (Fünen).</p>
                            <p>Hop-growing is hardly known in the south, but forms an important industry in England, Austria, Germany and Belgium. Among the
                                exotics exclusively cultivated in the south are the sugar-cane, the cotton plant, and rice. The first, which is found in Spain
                                and Sicily, is of little practical moment; the second holds a secondary position in Turkey and Greece ; and the third is pretty
                                extensively grown in special districts of Italy, more particularly in the valley of the Po. Even pepper is cultivated to a small
                                extent in the extreme south of Spain. Of the vast number of fruit trees which flourish in different parts of the continent only
                                a few can be mentioned. Their produce furnishes articles of export to Austria-Hungary, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and

                            <p>Perhaps the most striking facts revealed by these two tables are these; first, that the United Kingdom is the only great
                                wheatgrowing country which has shown a great decline in the amount of production in two successive periods; and, second, that
                                both Germany and Russia show a great advance under both wheat and rye between the last two periods. This gives interest to
                                statistics of acreage under these two crops, and some data under that head are given in the adjoining tables.</p>

                                forest; for even after long centuries of human occupation the Roman conquerors found vast regions where the axe had made no

                                it probably included what are now called the Schwarzwald, the Odenwald, the Spessart, the Rhön, the Thüringerwald, the Harz, the
                                Fichtelgebirge, the Erzgebirge and the Riesengebirge. Since then the progress of population has subjected many thousands of
                                square miles to the plough, and in some parts of the continent it is only where the ground is too sterile or too steep that the
                                trees have been allowed to retain possession. Several countries, where the destruction has been most reckless, have been obliged
                                to take systematic measures to control the exploitation and secure the replantation of exhausted areas. To this they have been
                                constrained not only by lack of timber and fuel but also by the prejudicial effects exerted on the climate and the irrigation of
                                the country by the denudation of the high grounds. But even now, on the whole, Europe is well wooded, and two or three countries
                                find an extensive source of wealth in the export of timber and other forest productions, such as turpentine, tar, charcoal,
                                bark, bast and potash.</p>

                            <p>Horse-breeding is a highly important industry in almost all European countries, and in several, as Russia, France, Hungary and
                                Spain, the state gives it exceptional support. Almost every district of the continent has a breed of its own: Russia reckons
                                those of the Bashkirs, the Kalmucks, the Don-Cossacks, the Esthonians and the Finlanders as among its best; France sets store by
                                those of Flanders, Picardy, Normandv, Limousin <pb n="915" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0915.png"/> and Auvergne; Germany by those of Hanover, Oldenburg and
                                Mecklenburg, which indeed rank among the most powerful in the world ; and Great Britain by those of Suffolk and Clydesdale. The
                                English racers are famous throughout the world, and Iceland and the Shetland Islands are well known for their hardy breed of
                                diminutive ponies. The ass and the mule are most abundant in the southern parts of the continent, more especially in Spain,
                                Italy and Greece. The camel is not popularly considered a European animal; but it is reared in Russia in the provinces of
                                Orenburg, Astrakhan and Taurid, in Turkey on the Lower Danube, and in Spain at Madrid and Cadiz ; and it has even been
                                introduced into Tuscany. A much more important beast of burden in eastern and southern Europe is the ox: the long lines of
                                slow-moving wains in Rumania, for example, are not unlike what one would expect in Cape Colony. In western Europe it is mainly
                                used for the plough or fattened for its flesh. It is estimated that there are about 100 distinct local varieties or breeds in
                                Europe, and within the last hundred years an enormous advance has been made in the development and specialization of the finer
                                types. The cows of Switzerland and of Guernsey may be taken as the two extremes in point of size, and the <q>"Durhams"</q> and
                                    <q>" Devonshires"</q> of England as examples of the results of human supervision and control. The Dutch breed ranks very
                                high in the production of milk. The buffalo is frequent in the south of Europe, more especially in the countries on the Lower
                                Danube and in southern Italy. Sheep are of immense economic value to most European countries, above all to Spain and Portugal,
                                Great Britain, France, Hungary, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic provinces of Germany and the south-east of
                                Russia. The local varieties are even more numerous than in the case of the horned cattle, and the development of remarkable
                                breeds quite as wonderful. In all the more mountainous countries the goat is abundant, especially in Spain, Italy and Germany.
                                The pig is distributed throughout the whole continent, but in no district does it take so high a place as in Servia. In the
                                rearing and management of poultry France is the first country in Europe, and has consequently a large surplus of both fowls and
                                eggs. In Pomerania, Brandenburg, West Prussia, Mecklenburg and Wurttemberg the breeding of geese has become a great source of
                                wealth, and the town of Strassburg is famous all the world over for its <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                cantharis. The silkworm is most extensively reared in northern Italy, but also in the southern parts of the Rhone valley in
                                France, and to a smaller extent in several other Mediterranean and southern countries. Bee-keeping is widespread. The cantharis
                                is largely reared in Spain, but also in other countries in southern and central Europe.</p>

                            <p>The most important mineral products of Europe are coal and iron ore. In order of production the leading coal-producing countries
                                have long been the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Belgium. Since 1897 Russia has held the fifth place, followed by
                                Austria-Hungary, Spain and Sweden. The production in other countries is insignificant. Besides coal, lignite is produced in
                                great amount in Germany and Austria-Hungary, and to a small amount in France, Italy and a few other countries. Down to 1895 the
                                United Kingdom stood first among the iron-ore producing countries of Europe, but since 1896 the order under this head has been
                                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the German Customs' Union</name>, the United Kingdom,
                                Spain, France, Russia, Sweden, Austria-Hungary and Belgium. By far the most important iron-ore producing district of Europe is
                                that which lies on different slopes of the hills in which German Lorraine, the grand duchy of Luxemburg and France meet, the
                                district producing all the ore of Luxemburg and the principal supplies of Germany and France. Another important producing
                                district is what is known as the Siegerland on the confines of the Prussian provinces of the Rhine and Westphalia. Next in
                                importance to these are the iron-ore deposits of the United Kingdom, the chief being those of the Cleveland district south of
                                the Tees, and the hematite fields of Cumberland and Furness.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the mineral production of Europe generally, perhaps the most notable fact to record is the relatively lower place
                                taken by the United Kingdom in the production both of coal and iron. Here it is enough to state the main results. In the
                                production of coal the United Kingdom is indeed still far ahead of all other European countries, but notwithstanding the fact
                                that the British export of coal has been increasing much more rapidly than the production, this country has not been able to
                                keep pace with Germany and Russia in the rate of increase of production. In 1878 the production of coal in the German empire was
                                only about 34 % of that of the United Kingdom, but in 1906 it had grown to nearly 50 %. This, too, was exclusive of lignite, the
                                production of which in Germany is increasing still more rapidly. It was equal to little more than one-fourth of the coal
                                production in 1878, but more than two-fifths in 1906. The coal production of Russia (mainly European Russia) is still relatively
                                small, but it is increasing more rapidly than that of any other European country. While in 1878 it was little more than 2 % of
                                that of the United Kingdom, in 1906 the corresponding ratio was above 8 %. In the production of iron ores the decline in the
                                position of the United Kingdom is much more marked. The production reached a maximum in 1882 (18,032,000 tons), and since then
                                it has sunk in one year (1893) as low as 11,200,000 tons, while, on the other hand, there was a rapid increase in the production
                                of such ores in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the German Zollverein (including
                                    Luxemburg)</name>, France, Spain, Sweden and Russia, down to 1900, with a more progressive movement, in spite of
                                fluctuations, in all these countries than in the United Kingdom in more recent years. In the total amount of production the
                                United Kingdom in 1905 took the second place. While in 1878 the production of iron ores in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the German Zollverein (including Luxemburg)</name> was little more than a third
                                of that in the United Kingdom, in 1905 it exceeded that of the United Kingdom by nearly 60 %.</p>

                            <p>Platinum has hitherto been obtained nowhere in Europe except in the auriferous sands in the Russian government of Perm. Nickel is
                                derived from Germany, Norway and Sweden ; antimony from Germany and Hungary; bismuth from Saxony and Bohemia. Bauxite, which is
                                used in the manufacture of aluminium, is obtained from France, Styria and Ireland. In order of importance the chief
                                salt-producing countries are the United Kingdom (in which for some years the amount produced has been for the most part
                                stationary or declining), Germany (which is rapidly increasing its production), Russia, France, Spain, Italy, Austria-Hungary,
                                Rumania and Switzerland. Besides common salt Germany has for many years been producing a rapidly increasing amount of potash
                                salts, of which it has almost a monopoly. Italy (chiefly Sicily) is by far the most <pb n="916" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0916.png"/> important producer of sulphur.
                                Among other mineral products may be mentioned the boric acid and statuary marble of Tuscany, the statuary marble of Greece, the
                                asphalt of Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary, the slates of Wales, Scotland and France, the kaolin of Germany,
                                England and France, and the abundant glass sands of Belgium, France and Bohemia.</p>

                            <p>With regard to commerce, industries and railways, as a whole, Europe may be said to be characterized by the rapid development of
                                manufacturing at the expense of agricultural industry. With few exceptions the countries of Europe that export agricultural
                                products are able to spare a diminishing proportion of the aggregate of such produce for export. Other countries are becoming
                                more and more dependent on imported agricultural products. Most European countries, even if not able to export a large
                                proportion of manufactured articles, are at least securing a greater and greater command of the home market for such
                                    products.<note>Probably the most complete synopsis of the evidence on this point is to be found in <bibl>

                                manufacturing industry are extending the range of their markets. All these changes have been largely, if not chiefly, promoted
                                by the improvements in the means of communication, and the methods of transport by sea and land. Larger ships more economically
                                propelled have brought grain at a cheaper and cheaper rate from all parts of the world, and improved methods of refrigeration
                                have made fresh meat, butter and other perishable commodities even from the southern hemisphere articles of rapidly growing
                                importance in European markets. Improvements in transport have likewise tended to cheapen British coal in many parts of the
                                mainland of Europe. On the other hand, the extension of the railway network of the continent has brought a wider area within the
                                domain of the manufacturing regions associated with the coalfields occurring at intervals in central Europe from the upper Oder
                                to the basin of the Ruhr, as well as some of the more detached coalfields of Russia. As affecting the relative advantages of
                                different European countries for carrying on manufacturing industry, three inventions or discoveries of recent years may be
                                mentioned as of capital importance: <list>
                                    <item>(1) the invention in 1879 of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sidney_Gilchrist_Thomas">Thomas</name> process for the manufacture of ingot iron and steel from the phosphoric iron ores, an invention which
                                        gave a greatly enhanced value to the ores on the borders of Lorraine, Luxemburg and Alsace, as well as others both in
                                        England and on the continent;</item>
                                    <item>(2) the invention of efficient machines for the application of power by means of electricity, an invention which gave
                                        greatly increased importance to the water-power of mountainous countries;</item>
                                    <item>and (3) the discovery of the fact that from lignite an even higher grade of producer gas may be obtained than from
                                        coal, a discovery obviously of special importance for the great lignite-producing districts of Germany and
                                        Bohemia</item>

                            <p>The figures derived from tho three recent industrial censuses of Switzerland are very instructive, especially if one is justified
                                in including the electric among the hydraulic installations. The estimates that have been made of the total available
                                water-power in a few European countries are mostly based on such problematical data that they are not worth giving. One very
                                uncertain element in such calculations is the amount of water-power that is capable of being artificially created by the
                                construction of valley-dams, such as have been erected on a small scale in the Harz and other mining and smelting regions of
                                Germany from an early date, and are now being built on a much larger scale in the Rhine region and other parts of Europe, or is
                                incidentally provided in the construction of canals.</p>

                            <p>From the form of the continent it obviously results that the farther east the route lies the greater is the saving of distance.
                                The precise direction of the routes has been very largely fixed, however, by the physical features ; by the course of the rivers
                                where navigable rivers formed parts of the routes; in other cases by the situation and form of the mountains, or the direction
                                of the river valleys which is implied in the form of the mountains. From the Black Sea the most convenient starting-point is
                                obviously towards the west, and two connecting routes with the Baltic lie wholly to the east of the mountains. One route makes
                                use of the Bug or the Dniester, the San and the Vistula so far as possible, while another starting in the same way proceeds
                                round the foot-hills of the Carpathians, thus finding easy crossing places on the head-streams of the rivers, as far as the Oder
                                and then down that stream. Another route is up the Danube to the neighbourhood of Vienna, and then north-eastwards through the
                                opening between the Carpathians and the Sudetic range to the head-waters of the Oder, crossing a water-parting little more than
                                1000 ft. in altitude. The first route was certainly used again and again by the ancient Greeks, starting from Olbia near the
                                mouth of the Bug, the objective point being the coast in the south-east of the Baltic supplying the amber which was so important
                                an article of commerce in early times. This route was again much used in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>, when Visby, on Gotland,- undoubtedly selected on
                                account of the security afforded by an island station, was for hundreds of years an important centre of trade both in northern
                                products (of which furs were the most valuable) and those of the East (pepper and other spices, silks and other costly
                                articles). Numerous coins, Roman, Byzantine and Arabic, found not merely in Gotland itself but also at various points along the
                                route indicated, testify to the long-continued importance of this route. In <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> the Oder route was also largely used whether reached by
                                rounding the Carpathians or ascending the Danube, and in connexion with that route the island of Bornholm long formed a focus of
                                commerce answering to that in Gotland farther east. The Danube route was also made use of farther west, and formed a large part
                                of a great route connecting the East with the north-west of Europe. The valuable goods of the Orient could be conveyed up-stream
                                as high as Ratisbon (Regensburg), and thence north-westward across Nuremberg to Frankfort-on-Main, from which access was had to
                                the Rhine gorge leading on to Cologne and the ports of Dordrecht and Rotterdam, Bruges and Ghent; or they could be carried still
                                farther up-stream to Ulm, thence by a route winding through the north of the Black Forest to Strassburg and from that point
                                north of the Vosges to the Marne and Seine.</p>

                                regular use of at least three such passes. One of these was the Brenner, the summit of which is under 4500 ft. in height,
                                approached on the south side by the valley of the Adige and its tributary the Eisak, on the other side by the Inn valley and
                                that of its small tributary the Sill. By this route the Alps at about their widest are crossed with exceptional ease; and hence
                                it was natural that it should have been used by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization">the
                                    Etruscans</name> to reach the amber shores of the Baltic, and in all subsequent periods in intercourse between central
                                Europe and northern Italy. In their trade with the mouth of the Rhine <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etruscan_civilization">the Etruscans</name> appear to have used only the passes approached
                                by the Dora Baltea, which leads equally to the Little St Bernard, to the south of Mont Blanc, and so to the Isere valley and the
                                Rhone, and to the Great St Bernard, to the east of Mont Blanc, and so directly to the Rhone valley above the Lake of Geneva, by
                                which route the remainder of the Alps could be rounded on the west and the Rhine valley reached by crossing the northern Jura.
                                Roman roads were afterwards made across all these passes, although that across the Great St Bernard (the highest of all, above
                                8100 ft.) seems never to have been made practicable for carriages. The Romans also made use of three intervening passes by which
                                in a single rise from the Po basin the heads of valleys leading right down to the head of Lake Constance could be reached. These
                                were the Bernardino, Splügen and Septimer, to mention them in the order from west to east. By the Romans the Simplon was also
                                made use of as affording the most direct connexion between Milan and the upper Rhone valley. All these passes were likewise in
                                use in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> when Venice and Genoa were the
                                great intermediaries in the trade in pepper and spices and other Oriental products. The Brenner afforded the most direct
                                connexion between Venice and southern Germany, on a route leading also to northern Germany by way of Ratisbon and afterwards the
                                rivers of the Elbe basin, and finally (from the end of the 14th century) by a canal to Lübeck, which was the great distributing
                                centre of these and other products for the Baltic. To take the most direct route to the Rhine valley and north-western Europe
                                some other pass (the Seefeld or the Fern) in the Bavarian Alps had to be crossed and the Rhine valley reached by Augsburg, and
                                thence either by way of Ulm or Frankfort. From Genoa the routes in the early <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">middle ages</name> were by way of Milan to the Lake of Constance, and thence
                                by way of Ulm if the Rhine valley was the goal, and by way of Augsburg if it was the Baltic. The St Gotthard route, the most
                                direct connexion between Milan and the north of the Alps, was added about the end of the 13th century. The Mont Cenis pass from
                                an early date afforded the most direct connexion between Genoa and the middle Rhone valley by way of Turin. When modern carriage
                                roads came to be built it was still the same routes that were chosen. The road across the Brenner, completed in 1772, was the
                                first of these. The building of the great Swiss carriage roads across the passes in the early part of the 19th century was
                                inaugurated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s road across the
                                Simplon completed in 1805. A later paragraph will show that modern railways follow much the same, if not exactly the same,
                                routes. On the early use of the Saône-Rhone valleys, and the route between the foothills of the Cevennes and the Pyrenees, it is
                                not necessary to insist, but it may be mentioned that English tin was sometimes conveyed to the Mediterranean (Marseilles) by
                                this latter route in Roman times.</p>

                            <p>Since the introduction of railways inland waterways have in most countries taken a very inferior position as means of transport.
                                The articles on the different countries supply the necessary information with respect to those which have a purely national
                                interest, but here mention must be made of those which have significance as belonging to trans-European routes or have an
                                international value. The importance of shortening the water-route between the opposite sides of the great European isthmus
                                separating the Baltic and the Black Sea is brought into prominence by the constant revival of projects for a ship-canal
                                connecting those coasts. A definite step taken with a view to carrying out such a project was the sanction given by the tsar in
                                April 1905 for the appointment of a special commission to inquire into the practicability of a scheme for the excavation of a
                                canal about 28 ft. deep between Riga and Kherson, utilizing the waters of the Diina or western Dvina, the Berezina and Dnieper.
                                Since the completion in 1845 of the Ludwigs or Danube-Main Canal, running from the Main near Bamberg to Kelheim on the Danube,
                                it has been possible to go by water from the mouth of the Rhine to the mouth of the Danube ; but this canal has in reality no
                                trans-European significance. It cannot take barges of a greater capacity than 125 tons, is not adapted for steamers, and carries
                                only a very small amount of traffic. But projects for connecting the Danube with northern Europe by water are still entertained.
                                Of these the most advanced are those for establishing connexions through Austria. On the 11th of June 1901 the Austrian diet
                                passed an act prescribing the construction of a canal connecting the Oder with the Danube through the Morava, and another
                                connecting the Danube at Linz with the Moldau-Elbe, and the improvement of the navigation on the connected waterways. The
                                Oder-Danube canal thus authorized would have to cross a watershed of little more than 1000 ft. in altitude as against 1365 ft.
                                in the case of the Ludwigs Canal; but the Elbe-Danube Canal would have to cross one of about 2250 ft. Under the provisions of
                                the act the work is to be completed by 1924. In Germany projects have been actively agitated for improving the Danube-Main
                                connexion either wholly or partly along the route of the present canal, and for establishing a new connexion by means of a canal
                                of at least 6 1/2 ft. in depth by way of the Neckar, the Rems and the Brenz, joining the Danube at Lauingen about midway between
                                Ulm and Donauworth. The Moldau-Elbe is itself an important international waterway, inasmuch as it allows of steamer traffic from
                                Prague in Bohemia to Hamburg, and by means of a connecting canal to Lübeck. But the most important of all international
                                waterways in Europe is the Rhine, on which even sea-going steamers regularly ascend to Cologne, and an amount of traffic crosses
                                the Dutch frontier three or four times as great as that which makes use of the Manchester ship-canal. The river is also
                                navigable to Basel in Switzerland, though above Strassburg the river is little used, being replaced since 1834 by the Rhine and
                                Rhone canal, which connects the two rivers through the Ill and the Saône. The Rhine is also connected with the Seine by the
                                Marne and Rhine canal passing north of the Vosges, and its tributary the Moselle is also navigable from France into Germany. The
                                Meuse again is navigable from France through Belgium into Holland, and is connected by more than one route with the Seine, and
                                in the densely peopled mining and manufacturing country in the north of France and the adjoining parts of Belgium numerous
                                waterways ramify in different directions. Even in an article on Europe the entirely French canals connecting the Seine and Rhone
                                (Burgundy canal, summit-level 1230 ft., completed 1832), the Loire and Rhone (Canal du Centre, summit-level 990 ft., completed
                                in 1793), and the Canal du Midi, connecting the Garonne at Toulouse with Cette on the Mediterranean, may be mentioned inasmuch
                                as they establish communication between different seas. The last is of special interest because it is the oldest (completed in
                                1681), because it makes use of the lowest crossing, surmounting the passage of Naurouse, or Gap of Carcassonne, at an altitude
                                of 625 ft., and because it effects the greatest shortening of distance from sea to sea. On this account the project of
                                establishing a ship-canal of modern dimensions along this route has been as often revived as that of the Black Sea and Baltic
                                canal. In the east of Europe the Vistula and Memel are both international waterways, but they are of little importance compared
                                with those in the west. The Kaiser Wilhelm or North Sea and Baltic canal, opened in 1895, has, however, no little international
                                value, inasmuch as it shortens the sea-route to the Baltic for all North Sea ports to the south of Newcastle, and affords the
                                means of avoiding a rather dangerous passage round the north of Jutland. A minor degree of international interest belongs to the
                                ship-canal through the Isthmus of Corinth, opened on the 6th of August 1893.</p>

                            <p>The chief railways of most European countries are on the same gauge as that originally adopted in Great Britain, namely, 4 ft. 8
                                1/2 in. Irish railways are, however, on the gauge of 5 ft. 3 in. The standard gauge in Russia is 5 ft., that of Spain and
                                Portugal about 5 ft. 6 in. The still isolated railway system of Greece is upon a narrow gauge. The very general use of a common
                                gauge obviously greatly facilitates international trade. It allows, for example, of wagons from Germany entering every country
                                on its frontier except Russia. It allows of German coal being carried without break of bulk to Paris, Milan and the mainland of
                                Denmark. By means of train ferries German trains can also be conveyed to Copenhagen by way of Warnemunde and Gjedser and then
                                across the channel separating Falster and Zealand and there is a similar means of communication between Copenhagen and Malmo
                                (Sweden) and between Lindau in Bavaria on the Lake of Constance and Romanshorn on the same lake in the Swiss canton of Thurgau.
                                The establishment of this method of transport between England and France has been urged in opposition to the Channel Tunnel
                                scheme.</p>
                            <p>Of the railway systems of the mainland of Europe as a whole the main features are these. There is a broad belt running from the
                                North Sea eastwards between the lines marked by Amsterdam and Hanover on the north, and Calais, Liege, Dusseldorf and Halle on
                                the south, in which important lines of railway run from west to east. About 12º E these lines begin to converge on Berlin. This
                                belt is crossed in the Rhine valley by a much narrower but very important belt running north and south, now connected with the
                                Italian railway system through the St Gotthard tunnel. To the south of the west end of the west-to-east belt lies the principal
                                railway focus in western Europe, Paris, from which important lines radiate in all directions two of these radiating lines now
                                establish communication with the Italian railway system, through the Mont Cenis and Simplon tunnels respectively, and other two
                                connecting with the Spanish system round the ends of the Pyrenees. Berlin in central Europe is perhaps an even more important
                                railway focus. Among the chief lines radiating from it are one through Leipzig and Munich and connecting with the Italian
                                railway system by the Brenner route, and another through Dresden and Prague to Vienna, and then by the Semmering pass by one
                                route to Triest and by another to Venice. East of Berlin the railways of Europe begin to form wider meshes. Two main lines
                                diverge towards the north east, one by Kustrin and Konigsberg and the other by Trankfort on the Oder and Thorn, both uniting at
                                Eydtkuhnen to the east of Konigsberg before crossing the Prussian frontier and passing on to St Petersburg. From Thorn a line
                                branches off by Warsaw to Moscow, the chief railway focus in eastern Europe. South-east from Berlin there runs another important
                                line through Breslau, Cracow and Lemberg to Odessa, skirting to a large extent the foot lulls of the Carpathians like the
                                ancient trade route from Olbia to the Baltic. Two routes on which there are services organized by <name type="institution">the
                                    International Sleeping Car Company</name> connect London with Constantinople, and it is noteworthy that both of these
                                indicate the importance of the physical feature which has determined the position of the great north south belt of railways
                                above mentioned, and also of towns famous as commercial centres in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. One of these is the route of the Orient Express, which
                                goes by Calais, Paris and Strassburg, then east of Strassburg runs north in the Rhine valley for about 40 m to Karlsruhe, then
                                winds through the hilly country between the Black Forest proper and the Odenwald to Stuttgart, proceeding thence by Ulm,
                                Augsburg and Munich to Linz and then by the valley of the Danube through Vienna and Budapest to Belgrade, and thence by the
                                valleys of the Morava, Nishava and Mantza to Constantinople. The other is that of the Ostend-Vienna express, going by Ostend to
                                Brussels and through Aix la-Chapelle to Cologne, then up the Rhine gorge southwards to Bingen and eastwards to Mainz and on to
                                Frankfort (on the Main), thence south-eastwards by the route so celebrated in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> through Nuremberg to Regensburg (Ratisbon), and thence
                                down the valley of the Danube coinciding with the Orient Express route from a point a few miles above Linz. From the Orient
                                Express route a branch crosses from the valley of the Morava to that of the Vardar, establishing a connexion with Salonica.</p>
                            <p>In the development of this railway system the mountains have proved the most formidable of natural obstacles, and at the head of
                                the mountains in this respect as in others stand the Alps. The first railway to cross one of the main chains of the Alps was the
                                Semmering line on the route from Vienna to the Adriatic, constructed in 1848- 1854. Its summit is in a tunnel less than 1 m
                                long, 2940 ft above sea level or nearly 300 ft below the level of the pass. South of the Semmering, however, various other
                                passes have to be crossed, and it was not till 1857 that the railway to Triest (by Laibach) was completed, and not till the late
                                seventies that the more direct route to Venice across the Tarvis pass in Carinthia was established. Of the route from Triest by
                                Gorz across the Karawanken and Tauern Alps to Salzburg and south eastern Germany the first section was opened only in 1906.
                                After the Semmering the next railway to cross the Alps was that following the Brenner route which crosses the summit of the pass
                                at the height of 4490 ft., and, as already stated, is the only pass that has to be crossed on the way from Munich to the plains
                                of Italy. Next followed in 1871 the western route through the so-called Mont Cenis tunnel, really under the Col de Fréjus, to
                                the west of the Mont Cenis pass, and effecting a crossing between the valleys of the Arc (Rhone basin) and the Dora Riparia (Po
                                basin) at an altitude of 4380 ft., or nearly 2500 ft lower than the pass previously used, but only by piercing the mountains in
                                a tunnel more than 7 1/2 m long. Next in order was the St Gotthard route opened in 1882, the most direct route between northern
                                Italy and western Germany, connecting the Lake of Lucerne with the valley of the Ticino. Here the altitude is reduced to 3785
                                ft, about 3150 ft below the summit level of the pass, but the tunnel length is increased to rather more than 9 1/2 m. The
                                Simplon route opened in June 1906, between the upper Rhone valley and the Toce valley, shortening the route between Milan and
                                northern France, effects the crossing at an altitude of only 2300 ft, nearly 4300 ft lower than the pass, but by increasing the
                                tunnel length to 12 1/4 m. Steps were subsequently taken to continue the Simplon route northwards by a tunnel through the
                                Lotschberg in the Bernese Alps, and a project is entertained for continuing the Vintschgau (upper Adige) railway across or under
                                the Reschenscheideck to the Inn valley. An important east-west crossing of the Alps was effected when the Arlberg tunnel

                            <p>Several lines wind through and cross the Jura. That which in 1857 pierced the Hauenstein, in the north of Switzerland, attained
                                international importance on the opening of the St Gotthard tunnel, inasmuch as it lies on the route thence through Lucerne to
                                the Rhine valley at Basel, and that which crosses the Col de Jougne between Vallorbe and Pontarher acquired similar importance
                                on the completion of the Simplon tunnel. Further projects are entertained for shortening the connexion between this tunnel and
                                the north of France by making a more direct line from Vallorbe to the French side of the Jura, or by making a railway across or
                                under the Col de la Faucille (4340 ft), north west of Geneva.</p>
                            <p>Of the two railways that pass round the extremity of the Pyrenees, the western was the first to be constructed, the eastern was
                                not opened till 1878. Hitherto the intervening mountains have proved more of a railway barrier than the mightier system of the
                                Alps, but in 1904 a convention was concluded between the French and Spanish governments providing for the establishment of
                                railway connexion between the two countries at three points of the great chain.</p>
                            <p>There are several railways across the Carpathians, mostly by passes under 3000 ft in height. The fact that the Tomos Pass, on the
                                direct route from Hungary through Transylvania to Bucharest, attains an altitude of 3370 ft was undoubtedly one reason why the
                                railway following this route, completed in December 1879, passing through several tunnels, was one of the last to be
                                constructed. But the obstruction of mountains has not been the only cause of delay in the building of railways. Sparseness of
                                population and general economic backwardness have also proved hindrances, especially in Russia and the Balkan Peninsula. The
                                railways to Constantinople and Salonica were completed only in 1888, and yet the highest altitude on the Constantinople line is
                                only 2400 ft, that on the Salonica line 1750 ft. Among other important railways of recent date and of more than merely national
                                significance may be mentioned that bringing Bucharest into connexion with the Black Sea port of Costantza by means of a bridge
                                across the Danube at Chernavoda (opened in September 1895), a line across the Carpathians connecting Debreczen with Lemberg, the
                                continuation of the line eastwards from Lemberg to Kiev, a network bringing the coalfield of the Donets basin into connexion
                                with ports on the Sea of Azov, a line in the south east of Russia connecting Novocherkask with Vladikavkaz, and branches running
                                from the same point connecting that line with Novorossiysk on the Black Sea on the one hand and with Tsaritsyn at the last angle
                                of the Volga on the other hand, a line in northern Russia bringing Archangel into connexion with the European system at Vologda
                                (opened in 1898), a detached line in the north-east across the Urals from Perm by Ekaterinburg (completed in 1878) to Tyumen
                                (completed in 1884). Chelyabinsk on the Siberian railway has a branch running northwards to Ekaterinburg, and this line now
                                affords uninterrupted communication with the northern Dvina, inasmuch as the railway which originally started at Perm has been
                                carried westwards through Vyatka and then northwards to Kotlas at the point of origin of that river, to which point it was
                                opened in 1900, and a line in the east connecting the European system at Samara with the great mining centre at Zlatoust,
                                already in 1890 continued across the Urals to Miyas, and since then carried farther east as the great Siberian railway.</p>
                            <p>The result of the construction of the numerous transcontinental railways has been to bring rail and sea routes and ports on
                                opposite sides of the continents into competition with one another to a greater degree than is possible in any other continent.
                                The more valuable, and above all perishable commodities may be sent right across the continent even through the mountains. Even
                                from Great Britain, which is bound to carry on its external commerce in part by sea, goods are sometimes sent far south in Italy
                                by railways running from one or other of the North Sea ports. It will hence be readily understood that for inland trade on the
                                mainland the competition between ports on opposite sides of the continent and between different railways will be very keen
                                greatly to the advantage of the inland centres to which that competition extends. This competition is inevitably all the more
                                keen now that the trade of Europe with <pb n="919" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0919.png"/> the East is once more carried on through the Mediterranean as it was in
                                ancient times and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. The great shortening
                                of the sea-route in this trade at such ports as Marseilles, Triest, Venice and Genoa, indicated by the figures below, goes far
                                to counterbalance the extra cost even of railway transport across the mountains. <table rows="5" cols="5">

                                chiefly consisted in the study of the physical type of different countries or districts, but it is not necessary to consider in
                                detail the results arrived at. It should, however, be pointed out that the idea of an Aryan race may be regarded as definitely
                                abandoned. One cannot even speak with assurance of the diffusion of an Aryan civilization. It is at least not certain that the
                                civilization that was spread by the migration of peoples speaking Aryan tongues originated amongst and remained for a time
                                peculiar to such peoples. The utmost that can be said is that the Aryan languages must in their earliest forms have spread from
                                some geographical centre. That centre, however, is no longer sought for in Asia, but in some part of Europe, so that we can no
                                longer speak of any detachment of Aryan-speaking peoples entering Europe.</p>

                                colour of the hair and eyes, most of the leading anthropologists seem to have come to the conclusion that there are three great
                                racial types variously and intricately intermingled in Europe. As described and named by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Z._Ripley">Ripley</name>, these are: <list>

                                The following table contains the names of the various languages which are still spoken on the continent, as well as of those
                                which, though now extinct, can be clearly traced in other forms. Two asterisks are employed to mark those which are emphatically
                                dead languages, while one indicates those which have a kind of artificial life in ecclesiastical or literary usage. <table rows="77" cols="2">

                            <p>The boundaries of European countries have of course been determined by history, and in some cases only historical events can be
                                held to account for their general situation, the influence of geographical conditions being seen only on a minute examination of
                                details. In most cases, however, it is otherwise. The present political boundaries were all settled when the general
                                distribution of population in the continent was in a large measure determined by the geographical conditions, and accordingly
                                the lines along which they run for the most part show the influence of such conditions very clearly, and thus present in many
                                cases a marked contrast to the political boundaries in America and Australia, where the boundaries have often been marked out in
                                advance of the population. In Europe the general rule is that the boundaries tend to run through some thinly peopled strip or
                                tract of country, such as is formed by mountain ranges, elevated tablelands too bleak for cultivation, relatively high ground of
                                no great altitude where soil and climate are less favourable to cultivation than the lower land on either side, or low ground
                                occupied by heaths or marshes or some other sterile soil; but it is the exception for important navigable rivers to form
                                boundaries between countries or even between important administrative divisions of countries, and for such exceptions a special
                                explanation can generally be found. Navigable rivers unite rather than separate, for the obvious reason that they generally flow
                                through populous valleys, and the vessels that pass up and down can touch as easily on one side as the other. Minor rivers, on
                                the other hand, flowing through sparsely peopled valleys frequently form portions of political boundaries simply because they
                                are convenient lines of demarcation. A brief examination of the present political map of Europe will serve to illustrate these
                                rules.</p>
                            <p>The eastern frontier of the Netherlands begins by running southwards through a marsh nearly parallel to the Ems but nowhere
                                touching it, then winds south or south-westwards through a rather sparsely peopled district to the Rhine. This river it crosses.
                                It then approaches but does not touch the Meuse, but runs for a considerable distance roughly parallel to that river along
                                higher ground, where the population is much more scanty than in the valley. On the side of Belgium the Dutch boundary is for the
                                most part thoroughly typical, winding between the dreariest parts of the Dutch or Belgium provinces of North Brabant, Limburg
                                and Antwerp. The Scheldt nowhere forms a boundary between countries, not even at its wide estuary. The eastern frontier of
                                Belgium is quite typical both on the side of Germany and Luxemburg. It is otherwise, however, on the south, where that country
                                confines with France, and indeed the whole of the north-east frontier of France may be called a historical frontier, showing the
                                influence of geographical conditions only in details. One of these details, however, deserves attention, the tongue in which it
                                advances northwards into Belgium so as to give to France the natural fortress of Givet, a tongue, be it noted, the outline of
                                which is as typical a boundary as is to be seen in Europe in respect of scantiness of population, apart from the fortress.</p>
                            <p>The mountainous frontiers of France on the east and south require hardly any comment. Only in the Burgundy Gate between the
                                Vosges and the Jura has an artificial boundary had to be drawn, and even that in a minor degree illustrates the general rule.
                                The division of the Iberian peninsula between Spain and Portugal goes back in effect to the Christian reaction against the
                                Moors. The valley of the Miňo and its tributaries establishes a natural connexion between Galicia and the rest of Spain ; but an
                                independent crusade against the Moors starting from the lower part of the valley of the Douro resulted in the formation of the
                                kingdom of Portugal, which found its natural eastern limit on the scantily peopled margin of the Iberian tableland, where the
                                rivers cease to be navigable and flow through narrow gorges, that of the Tagus, where the river marks the frontier, being almost
                                without inhabitants, especially on the Spanish side.</p>
                            <p>The greater part of the Italian boundary is very clearly marked geographically, though we have to look back to the weakness of
                                divided Italy to account for the instances in which northern mountaineers have pushed their way into southern Alpine valleys.
                                Even in these parts, however, there are interesting illustrations of geographical influence in the way in which the Italian
                                boundary crosses the northern ends of the Lago Maggiore and the Lake of Garda, and cuts off portions of Lake Lugano both in the
                                east and west. In all these cases the frontier crosses from one steep unpeopled slope to another, assigning the population at
                                different ends or on different sides of the lakes to the country to which belongs the adjacent population not lying on their
                                shores.</p>
                            <p>Of the Swiss frontiers all that it is necessary to remark is that the river Rhine in more than one place marks the boundary, in
                                one, however, where it traverses alluvial flats liable to inundation (on the side of Austria), in the other place where it
                                rushes through a gorge below the falls of Schaffhausen. The southern frontier of Germany is almost throughout typical, the
                                northern is the sea, except where a really artificial boundary runs through Jutland.</p>
                            <p>In the east of Germany and the north-east of Austria the winding frontier through low plains is the result of the partition of
                                Poland, but in spite of the absence of marked physical features it is for the most part in its details almost as typical as the
                                mountainous frontier on the south of Germany. All the great rivers are crossed. Most of the line runs through a tract of
                                strikingly scanty population, and the dense population in one part of it, where upper Silesia confines with Russian Poland, has
                                been developed since the boundary was fixed.</p>
                            <p>In the Balkan Peninsula the most striking facts are that the Balkans do not, and the Danube to a large extent does form a
                                boundary. Geographical features, however, bring the valley of the Maritsa (eastern Rumelia) into intimate relation with upper
                                Bulgaria, the connexion of which with Bulgaria north of the Balkans had long been established by the valley of the Isker, narrow
                                as that valley is. On the side of Rumania, again, it is the marshes on the left bank of the Danube even more than the river
                                itself that make of that river a frontier. An examination of the eastern boundary of all that is included in Russia in Europe
                                will furnish further illustrations of the general rule.</p>
                            <p>Finally, on the north-west of Russia it was only natural that the Tornea and the Tana should be taken as lines of demarcation in
                                that thinly peopled region, and it was equally natural that where the <table rows="31" cols="6">

                            <p>The origin of the name of Europe has been dealt with above, and the difficulty of any exact definition of the geographical limits
                                covered by this term has been pointed out. A similar difficulty meets us when we come to deal with European history. We know
                                what we mean when we speak of European civilization, though in its origins, as in its modern developments, this was not confined
                                to Europe. In one sense the history of Europe is the history of this civilization and of the forces by which it was produced,
                                preserved and developed; for a separate history of Europe could never have been written but for the alien powers by which this
                                civilization was for centuries confined within the geographical limits of the European continent. Moreover, within these
                                geographical limits the tradition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman
                                    Empire</name>, and above all the organization of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Catholic Church</name>, gave to the European nations, and the
                                states based upon them, a homogeneity which without them could not have survived. The name of Europe, indeed, remained until
                                modern times no more than <q>" a geographical expression "</q> ; its diplomatic use, in the sense of a group of states having
                                common interests and duties, is, indeed, no older than the 19th century ; in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> its place was taken by the conceptions of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church">the Church</name> and the Empire, which, though
                                theoretically universal, were practically European. Yet the history of the states system of Europe, though enormously influenced
                                by outside forces, possesses from the first a character of its own, which enables it to be treated as a separate unit. This
                                historical Europe, however, has never been exactly commensurate with Europe considered as a geographical division. Russia,
                                though part of Europe geographically—even if we set the limits of Asia at the Don with certain old geographers —had but slight
                                influence on European history until the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_I_of_Russia">Peter
                                    the Great</name>. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">The Ottoman empire</name>,
                                though its influence on the affairs of Europe was from the first profound, was essentially an Asiatic power, and was not
                                formally introduced into the European system until <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1856)">the treaty of
                                    Paris of 1856</title>. It still remains outside European civilization.</p>
                            <p>Europe, then, as we now conceive the term in its application to the political system and the type of culture established in this
                                part of the world, may, broadly speaking, be traced to four principal origins : <list>
                                    <item>(1) The Aegean civilization (Hellenic and pre- Hellenic);</item>
                                    <item>(2) <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> ;</item>
                                    <item>(3) Christianity ;</item>
                                    <item>(4) the break-up of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> by
                                        the Teutonic invasions</item>
                                </list>. All these forces helped in the development of Europe as we now know it. To the Aegean civilization, whether transformed
                                by contact with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, and again transformed by the
                                influence of Christianity and the religious genius of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the
                                    middle ages</name>—or rediscovered during the classical <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name>—Europe owes the characteristic qualities of its thought and of its expression in literature and art.
                                From republican <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> it largely draws its conceptions
                                of law and of administrative order. From <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman
                                    Empire</name> it inherited a tradition of political unity which survived, in visible form, though but as a shadowy symbol,
                                until <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the last Holy Roman emperor</name>
                                abdicated in 1806 ; survived also, more fruitfully, in the rules of the Roman lawyers which developed into modern international
                                law. Yet more does Europe owe to Christianity, an Asiatic religion, but modified by contact with Greek thought and powerfully
                                organized on the lines of the Roman administrative system. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church">The Roman Church</name> remained a reality when <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> had become little more than a name, and was
                                throughout the period of chaos and transformation that followed the collapse of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> the most powerful instrument for giving to the
                                heterogeneous races of Europe a common culture and a certain sense of common interests.</p>
                            <p>The history of Europe, then, might well begin with the origins of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, and trace the rise of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> and the successive influence upon it of Hellenism and
                                Christianity. These subjects are, however, very fully dealt with elsewhere (see AEGEAN CIVILIZATION ; GREECE ; ROME ; CHURCH
                                HISTORY) ; and it will, therefore, be more convenient to begin this account with the Teutonic invasions and the break-up of
                                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name>, events which mark the
                                definite beginning of the modern European states system.</p>
                            <p>In a sense <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman Empire</name> had been already <q>"
                                    barbarized "</q> before the invasions of the barbarians <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                Land left vacant by the dwindling of the population was colonized by immigrants, Teutonic and other, from beyond the frontiers ;
                                the Roman legions were largely recruited from <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Germans</name> and other non- Romans, some of whom even rose to the imperial purple. Thus, in the end, the Roman emperor,
                                with his guard and his household, ruling over an empire mercilessly exploited to fill his treasury, was essentially
                                indistinguishable from those barbarian chiefs, with their antrustions and their primitive fiscal methods, who entered into
                                portions of his inheritance and carried on the traditions of his rule.</p>
                            <p>The history of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">the Teutonic peoples</name> prior to their
                                organized invasions of the empire is dealt with elsewhere (see TEUTONIC PEOPLES). It was in the 4th century that the pressure of
                                their advance was first felt on the frontiers, and this led to a change in the government of the empire which was to have
                                notable consequences. In A.D. 330 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantine_I">Constantine</name> had
                                transferred the capital from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Byzantium (Constantinople)</name>, but <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the empire</name>, from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/River_Forth">the Forth</name> to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tigris">the Tigris</name>, continued to be administered successfully from a single centre.
                                Not, however, for long: the increasing perils from without made a closer supervision essential, and after the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodosius_I">Theodosius I.</name> (395) <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the empire</name> was divided <pb n="923" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0923.png"/>

                                and his successors. These invasions were of two types, <list>

In 429 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geiseric">Gaiseric</name>, king of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vandals">the Vandals</name>, at the invitation, it is said, of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bonifacius">the governor Bonifacius</name>, passed over from Spain to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa_Province">Roman Africa</name>, which became the centre of another <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Teutonic</name> kingdom, soon established as a great naval
                                power which for a while commanded the Mediterranean and devastated the coasts of Italy and Sicily with its piracies.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franks">the Franks</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burgundians">Burgundians</name> were pressing into Germany and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name>, while from 449 onwards <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxons">the Saxons</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Angles">the

                                For a moment it was doubtful if the <name type="people">Aryan</name> or <name type="people">Turanian</name> races would be
                                supreme, but in 451 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Attila_the_Hun">Attila</name>, king of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">the Huns</name>, was decisively beaten in the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Châlons-en-Champagne">Châlons</name> by a combination of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franks">Franks</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goths">Goths</name> and Romans, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flavius_Aetius">the Roman general

                                This battle decided that Europe was to be Christian and independent of Asia and Africa. In 476 the succession of Western
                                emperors came to an end with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Odoacer">Odoacer</name>'s occupation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, and with the decision of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Senate">the Roman senate</name> that one emperor was enough, and that the Eastern
                                emperor, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeno_(emperor)">Zeno</name>, should rule the whole empire. For a

                                rise of independent <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Teutonic</name> kingdoms in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name> and Spain. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clovis_I">Clovis</name> (d 511), the king of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franks">the Franks</name>, had already established his power, and in Spain, the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Visigoths">West Gothic</name> kingdom, with its capital at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toledo,_Spain">Toledo</name>, now asserted its <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Teutonic</name> independence. Under the emperor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justinian_I">Justinian</name> (527-565), indeed, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">the Roman empire</name> seemed in a fair way to recover its supremacy;
                                the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vandals">Vandal</name> kingdom in Africa was destroyed; in 555 the
                                Byzantine general <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Narses">Narses</name> finally shattered the power of

                                dependence on the Eastern emperor; <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Visigoths">the West Goths</name> were
                                forced to give up the south of Spain; and the Persians were checked. But with the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Justinian_I">Justinian</name> troubles began. In 568 <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombards">the Lombards</name>, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alboin">Alboin</name>, appeared in Italy, which they overran as far south as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiber">the Tiber</name>, establishing their kingdom on the ruins of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exarchate_of_Ravenna">the exarchate</name>. Though in Asia <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">the emperor Heraclius</name>, in a series of victorious campaigns,
                                broke the Persian power and succeeded, even in extending the Roman dominion, Italy, save for a while <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ravenna">Ravenna</name> itself and a few scattered sea-coast towns, was thenceforth lost to
                                the empire of which in theory it still formed a part.</p>
                            <p>This catastrophe produced one result the importance of which it is impossible to exaggerate : the development of the political
                                power of <name type="institution">the papacy</name>. At the beginning of the 6th century <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name>, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodoric_the_Great">Theodoric the Goth</name>, was still the city of the Caesars, the
                                tradition of its ancient life was yet unbroken; at the end of the century <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name>, under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_I">Pope Gregory the Great</name> (590-604), had become the city of the popes.
                                And with the city the popes entered into some of the inheritance of the Caesars; in the world-wide activity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_I">Gregory</name> we already have a foreshadowing of universal
                                claims, often effectively asserted, which made the great medieval popes, in a truer sense than the medieval emperors, the
                                representatives of the idea of the Roman imperial unity (see ROME, sec. ii. <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages</hi>; PAPACY)</p>

                                the Hegira. The full force of the militant religion founded by the Arab prophet was not felt till after his death (632). <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">The emperor Heraclius</name>, the vigour of his manhood passed,
                                was unable to meet this new peril; the Arabs, strong in their hardy simplicity and new-born religious fanaticism, and aided by
                                the treason and cowardice of the decadent Roman governing classes, overran Asia Minor, conquered Egypt and the whole of northern
                                Africa, overwhelmed the Gothic kingdom in Spain, and even penetrated beyond the Pyrenees to the conquest of the province of

                                conquests was that Christian civilization became gradually confined to Europe ; another was that the trade routes to the East

                            <p>Feudalism, by the time the Northmen had been subdued by its aid, was quite firmly established in the western part of Europe.
                                During the 11th century it was carried by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normans">the Normans</name> into
                                England, into Sicily and southern Italy, and by the nobles of the first crusade into the newly established <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Jerusalem">kingdom of Jerusalem</name> (1099). By the kings
                                of France, England and Germany, however, who saw themselves in danger of being stripped of all but the semblance of power by its
                                delegation to their more or less nominal vassals, the feudal organization was early recognized as impossible as a form of state
                                government, if the state was to be preserved ; and the history of the three great European powers during the succeeding
                                centuries is mainly that of the struggle of the sovereigns against the disruptive ambitions of the great feudal nobles. In
                                England the problem was, from the outset, simplified; for though <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_I_of_England">William the Conqueror</name> introduced the system of feudal land
                                tenure into England in 1066 he refused to set it up as his system of government, retaining alongside of it the old English
                                national policy. In France, on the other hand, feudalism as a system of government had become firmly established; and it was not
                                till the days of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_II_of_France">Philip Augustus</name> (1180-1223)
                                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France">Louis IX.</name> (1226-1270) that the monarchy
                                began to get the upper hand. From this time until the 17th century the power of the French monarchy, in spite of occasional
                                lapses, grew steadily stronger. The reverse was the case with the German kingship. Its association with the undefined claims
                                involved in the title of Roman emperor, traditionally attached to it, and notably those to authority in Italy, necessitated
                                concession after concession to the feudal nobles, in order to purchase their support for their assertion. The kingship,
                                moreover, became elective; the imperial title was obtainable only at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name> at the hands of the pope; and the German kings thus became entangled in contests, not only with their own
                                vassals, but with the tremendous spiritual force of the medieval <name type="institution">papacy</name> by which, for its own
                                ends, the spirit of feudal insubordination was from time to time fomented. Thus in Germany the feudal nobles gradually acquired
                                a sovereign status which, in some cases, has survived the territorial rearrangements of the 19th century and left its mark on
                                the federal constitution of modern Germany ; while the kingship and the imperial title grew more and more shadowy till in 1806
                                it vanished altogether. (See ENGLISH HISTORY ; FRANCE : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>; GERMANY : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>.)</p>

In 911 the German magnates had elected <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conrad_I_of_Germany">Conrad the Franconian</name> to reign over them, and in 919 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_the_Fowler">Henry " the Fowler " of Saxony</name>, " whose reign forms

                                brought him into collision with the German Church and to some extent with the German nobles. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Henry II.</name> (1002-1025) asserted with success his
                                authority over Germany, and his successor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conrad_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Conrad II.</name>, who belonged to the Salian or Franconian line, did much to secure unity and prosperity to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name>.

                                withstand the temptation of struggling to establish their influence over Italy. Unfortunately for German kingship <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Henry IV.</name> (1056-1106) was only six years

                            <p>With the era of the Crusades, which lasted till the middle ot the 13th century, Europe entered upon a period of change, the
                                importance of which is realized by contrasting the condition of western Christendom in the 11th with its condition in the 13th
                                century. Between the opening and close of the crusading movement Europe underwent a complete revolution. While the <pb n="926" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0926.png"/>
                                Crusades tended to enhance the prestige and authority of <name type="institution">the papacy</name> and the power of European
                                monarchs, they also led to increased knowledge of the East, to the rapid development of commerce; to the introduction of new
                                industries, to the rapid decline of the influence of the feudal nobility, and to the rapid development of town life (see
                                COMMUNE). At the same time the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_VII">Hildebrandine</name>
                                reformation was having an immense influence upon the intellectual condition of Europe. The 12th century saw the establishment of
                                many new monastic orders (see MONASTICISM), and at the same time a remarkable speculative and literary revival (see
                                SCHOLASTICISM). This movement owed not a little of its success to the influence of the Crusades, which stirred up intellectual
                                as well as commercial activity. This intellectual activity, as well as the fruits of commercial expansion, were— since learning
                                was still a monopoly of the clerical order—weapons in the hands of <name type="institution">the papacy</name>, which in the 12th
                                century attained the height of its power, if not of its pretensions. It is, indeed, impossible to exaggerate the influence of
                                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name> upon the
                                development of Europe at this period. The popes, in fact, represented Europe in a sense that could not be predicated of the
                                emperors ; the terror of their spiritual power, their vast wealth derived from the tribute of all the West, their unique
                                experience of international affairs, and—in the case of the great popes of this epoch—the superiority of their minds and
                                characters, made them not only the spiritual rulers of Europe, but the effective centres of whatever political unity it
                                possessed. As a Byzantine observer was to observe of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Innocent_III">Innocent III.</name>, they had become the successors of the Caesars rather than of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Peter">Peter</name> (see PAPACY).</p>

                            <p>The rest of Europe was also in various degrees affected by the Crusades. While Spain was occupied in a crusade of her own against
                                the Moors and gradually driving them into <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Granada">Granada</name>, Germany,
                                Italy, and to some extent England, were interested in, and influenced by, the Crusades against the Turks. During the absence of
                                many of the nobles in the East the growth of towns and the development of the mercantile class proceeded without interruption.
                                The trading classes demanded strong governments and equal justice, and vigorously supported the monarchs in their suppression of
                                feudalism.</p>
                            <p>During the 12th and 13th centuries the Crusades thus proved a large factor in the commercial prosperity of the Italian maritime
                                states, an <q>" open door "</q> between East and West was secured, and reinforcements from Europe were poured into Syria as long
                                as the peoples of the West regarded the stability of <name type="institution">the Latin kingdom of Syria</name> as a matter of
                                prime importance. During the crusading period a check was placed to the tide of Mahommedan conquest, while to <name type="institution">the caliphate</name> the Crusades proved a perpetual drain upon its material resources. To the
                                Mahommedans the possession of <name type="place">the Holy Places</name> by the Christians was as great a humiliation as their
                                desecration by the Mahommedans was to the crusaders. Unfortunately the Crusades led to a disastrous schism between <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">the Byzantine empire</name> and western Christendom,
                                which had calamitous results. The decay of the crusading spirit was a necessary result of the growth of the consolidation of the
                                European nations, but the price paid was the fall of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> and the establishment of the Turks in eastern Europe. The Crusades thus not only postponed the
                                conquest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> by the Turks for some two
                                hundred years, but led, as has already been said, to a vast expansion of commerce, as seen in the rapid growth and development
                                of the Italian cities, and to a striking development of town life.</p>

                                15th century might well be styled the latter centuries. days of medieval Europe.</p>
                            <p>During the 14th and 15th centuries the idea of regarding Europe as one state in which emperor and pope presided over a number of
                                subordinate kings gave way before the spirit of nationalism and particularism. England, France and Spain were rapidly becoming
                                strong centralized monarchies which stood in striking contrast to the weakened <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">Empire</name>. Partly no doubt owing to the failure of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> and <name type="institution">the
                                    papacy</name> to work together, a great impetus had been given to the formation of national monarchies. While <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Frederick II.</name> had failed, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_IX_of_France">Louis IX.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_IV_of_France">Philip IV.</name> of France, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_III_of_Castile">Ferdinand III. of Castile</name> (1217-1252), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_I_of_Aragon">James the Conqueror, king of Aragon</name> (1213-1276) and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_I_of_England">Edward I. of England</name> (1239-1307) succeeded in
                                laying the foundations of strong monarchies which after two centuries of struggles with the dying efforts of feudalism were
                                established on a firm basis. In spite of the intellectual activity and political developments which characterized the 13th, 14th
                                and 15th centuries it remains true that the later <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">middle

                            <p>During the whole of the 15th century Europe had been affected by what is known as the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name> movement, which marked the transition from the medieval to
                                the modern order. This movement, caused by the growth of learning, had its first home in Italy, which had witnessed a marvellous
                                revival of interest in classical antiquity, in painting and in sculpture, accompanied by a keen intellectual activity in
                                religious and political, no less than in literary matters. Criticism of existing beliefs was developed, knowledge became widely
                                diffused, and, while the way was prepared for the substitution of individualism for the old ecclesiastical system, the
                                development of commerce coincident with the discovery of America and the establishment of monarchical systems destroyed
                                feudalism (see RENAISSANCE). The later years of the 15th, and the early years of the 16th, centuries may be described as the
                                transition from medievalism to modern times, from feudalism to individualism, from the idea of a world church and a world empire
                                to one in which national consolidation was the chief feature and monarchical government a necessity.</p>

                                general characteristics of the new period upon which Europe now enters. With the growth of monarchies arises the belief in the
                                divine right of kings, the development of territorial sovereignty, and wars of ambition like those waged by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis XIV.</name>

                            <p>The advent of the Reformation, as has already been pointed out, finally shattered that ideal of civil and religious unity which
                                had been the main characteristic of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>.
                                Thus from the beginning of the 16th century Europe sees the development of the modern states system and becomes the scene of
                                national wars in which the idea of the balance of power was the leading principle (see BALANCE OF POWER). That principle did not
                                allow of the recognition of the rights of nationalities, and till the wars of the French Revolution the interests of the various
                                European states were usually subordinated to the dynastic aims of their rulers. During the ensuing centuries the balance of
                                power in Europe was seriously threatened ; during the first half of the 16th century by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Charles V.</name>, during the latter half of the same

                            <p>The close of the Seven Years' War seemed to prelude a period of British ascendancy on the continent, but that danger passed away
                                with the outbreak of the war between Great Britain and her American colonies. For a time the balance of power in Europe was
                                completely shattered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s brilliant

                                definitely marked the beginning of modern times both from a political as well as from a religious point of view.</p>

                                spite of occasional reverses, the French and their allies gradually wore down their adversaries. After the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_IV_of_France">Henry IV.</name> in 1610 France had temporarily retired
                                from a foremost place in the politics of Europe, and for some thirty years her ministers were busy in coercing the Huguenots and
                                establishing the supremacy of the crown which was threatened by the nobles. Once united at home France was ready and eager to
                                seize the opportunity for inflicting a severe blow upon <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the Habsburgs</name> in Spain and Austria. The time for such action was
                                well chosen. Austria was weakened by the war which had been waged since 1618, while Spain, exhausted by her efforts in the
                                preceding century, had entered upon a long period of decay, and was about to see Portugal regain its independence. The
                                Protestant princes in the north of Germany were ready to ally with France and Sweden against the emperor, even the Catholic
                                Bavarian duke was to prove a doubtful ally of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the

                                Germany. By that peace the practical independence of the German princes was assured. Henceforward each prince could decide what
                                form of religion was to be observed in his dominions. Thus Lutheranism, Calvinism and Catholicism were alike tolerated, and this
                                recognition of the principle of compromise prepared the way for a wider toleration. Moreover, the petty principalities of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name>, which numbered over 300, were
                                allowed the right of concluding alliances with any foreign power, of making their own laws, and of carrying on war. Thus, in

                                    II.</name> to England in 1660, a new period in the history of personal monarchy in Europe began. At the time of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Westphalia">the peace of Westphalia</title> the monarchy in Europe was under a
                                cloud. In England the cause of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_I_of_England">Charles I.</name> was
                                lost; in France the Fronde was holding its own against <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardinal_Mazarin">Mazarin</name>; in Germany the princes had triumphed over the emperor ; even in Russia the nobles were aiming at the
                                curtailment of the power of the crown. But from 1660 it became evident that these attempts to secure the curtailment of the
                                monarchical power were, with few exceptions, not destined to be successful. Though all chance of the establishment of a strong
                                central authority in Germany had disappeared, the various states composing <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> now entered upon a new period in their history and
                                speedily formed miniature despotisms. Of these Brandenburg, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name> were the most important. In

                            <p>Thus when <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis XIV.</name> took into his own hands the
                                government of France, the absolutist principle was triumphant all over Europe. The period of his personal rule lasted from 1661
                                to his death in 1715, and is known as <q>" the age of Louis XIV."</q> During that period France was the leading monarchy in

                            <p>During his reign France took the lead in European politics, and established her supremacy all the more easily, owing partly to
                                the weakness of most of the European countries, partly to the aggressions of the Turks, whose invasions of eastern Europe
                                occupied from 1683 to 1699 the attention of the Poles and of the Austrians. The weakness or neutrality of the various European
                                states was due to various causes. England was prevented till 1689 from taking a part in opposing the ambitious schemes of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis XIV.</name> owing to the personal aims of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_II_of_England">Charles II.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_II_of_England">James II.</name>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philip_IV_of_Spain">Philip IV.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_II_of_Spain">Charles II.</name> of Spain could do nothing to resist the growing
                                ascendancy of France, owing to the increasing weakness and rapid decadence of Spain, whose disappearance from the rank of great
                                powers was one of the most striking features in the history of Europe during the second half of the 17th century. The weakness
                                of Germany from <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Westphalia">the peace of Westphalia</title> to the end of the
                                century, due partly to the establishment of the independence of the princes of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name>, partly to the unrest in Hungary, partly to the
                                aggressions of the Turks, was obviously an immense gain to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis XIV.</name>

                            <p>Realizing the strength of his own position and the weakness of that of most of the European states, he entered in 1667 into the
                                Devolution war and secured several fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands. From 1672 to 1678 he was again at war with Holland,
                                and from 1673 with the emperor, Spain and Brandenburg as well. At the same time the Turks invaded Poland, but were successfully
                                resisted by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_III_Sobieski">John Sobieski</name>. In 1676, however, they
                                made the favourable <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Żurawno">treaty of Żurawna</title>, securing <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kamianets-Podilskyi">Kamenets</name> and portions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Podolia">Podolia</name> and the Ukraine. Thus, while the Turks were threatening the
                                independence of eastern Europe, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis XIV.</name> was
                                attacking the independence of western Europe. In 1678 he made <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaties_of_Nijmegen">the
                                    treaty of Nijmwegen</title>, securing great advantages for France. Till the end of the century Europe was faced with two
                                serious problems : Could she successfully cope with the Turks on her eastern frontier? And could she resist the continued
                                aggressions of France on her western frontier ? Consequently the years from 1678 to the end of the century were of vital
                                importance to the European world. For during that period the French and the Turks made unceasing efforts to extend their
                                frontiers at the expense of Germany. Encouraged by the weakness of the chief European states, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> set up <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chambers_of_Reunion">the Chambers of Reunion</name>, seized <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strasbourg">Strassburg</name> in time of peace and attempted to annex Luxemburg. At the
                                same time it seemed that an independent Gallican Church would be set up, and that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name>, like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII.</name>, would sever all connexion with Rome. The
                                persecution of the Jansenists and the revocation of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edict_of_Nantes">the edict of
                                    Nantes</title> in 1685 established something akin to religious uniformity in France. Buoyed up by his successes abroad and
                                at home, and conscious that he had nothing to fear from England or from Spain, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> prepared to carry out his schemes, with regard to the
                                extension of his territory eastwards, at the expense of Germany. Simultaneously with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name>' aggressions in western Europe, the Turks had made an
                                attempt to capture <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name> in 1683. Fortunately the efforts of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the emperor Leopold</name>, aided by
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_III_Sobieski">John Sobieski</name>, king of Poland, were
                                successful, and the Turkish tide of conquest was gradually but successfully checked. It was not, however, till the accession of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_III_of_England">William III.</name> to the English throne that
                                the tide of French conquest in western Europe was in like manner successfully resisted, and it was not till <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Ryswick">the treaty of Ryswick</title> in 1697 that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> realized that Europe had set a limit to his conquests.
                                That treaty inflicted a blow on the prestige of France, just as <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Karlowitz">the
                                    treaty of Karlowitz</title>, concluded in 1699, was an important step in the decline of the Ottoman power. By that treaty,
                                which marks a definite beginning in the history of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the hands of the emperor were freed, and he
                                was able to devote his attention to the Spanish succession question, which already engrossed the attention of all Europe.</p>

Not content with this success <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XIV_of_France">Louis</name> committed a number of aggressive acts which
                                led to the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702. That war continued till 1713, when <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Utrecht">the treaty of Utrecht</title>, followed in 1714 by the treaties of
                                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Rastatt">Rastadt</title> and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Baden">Baden</title>, ended a struggle which had many results of vital importance
                                to Europe. Great Britain, strengthened by the possession of Gibraltar and Minorca, by her establishment in Canada, and by
                                trading rights in South America, henceforward stood forth as a rising colonial power to whom the command of the sea was
                                essential. Austria obtained not only Belgium, which she held till the French Revolution, but also a firm foothold in Italy,
                                which she maintained till 1859. To Spain the war indirectly brought unexpected benefits. Freed from her expensive possessions in
                                Belgium and Italy, and now ruled by a new dynasty, Spain, so far from meeting with the fate which later attended Poland, entered
                                upon a new period in her career, and throughout the 18th century showed considerable power of resistance to the colonial policy
                                of Great Britain.</p>

                                southern nations. It marked the decline of Sweden and the rise of Russia, which henceforth played an important part in European
                                politics. Nevertheless till 1740, with the exception of the short Polish Succession War 1733-35 and the equally short war of
                                1737-39, in which Russia and Austria fought against Turkey, no general European struggle took place. That this was so was due in
                                great measure to the alliance of 1717 between Great Britain and France, to the subsequent peace policy upheld by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Walpole">Walpole</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/André-Hercule_de_Fleury">Fleury</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/José_Patiño">Patiño</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arvid_Horn">Horn</name> (the English, French, Spanish and Swedish ministers), to the

                            <p>During those years from 1713 to 1740 the great powers were slowly forming themselves into groups, bound together by motives of
                                interest. Thus Spain and France after 1729 began to realize that both countries were interested in checking Great Britain's
                                colonial developments, while Spain was also ready to seize every opportunity of increasing her possessions in Italy at the
                                expense of Austria.</p>

                            <p>The Seven Years' War (1756-63) opened with a diplomatic revolution as important as that of 1717, when France and Great Britain
                                made an alliance. In May 1756, as a reply to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Westminster_(1756)">the treaty of
                                    Westminster the Second</title>, made in January between Great Britain and Prussia, France and Austria united in <title>the
                                    treaty of Versailles</title>. This unexpected union, which lasted till the French Revolution, between two powers which had
                                been hostile to each other from the beginning of the 16th century, amazed all Europe. However, it had not the results expected,
                                for although Russia, which was allied with Austria, sent large armies headed by capable generals to the war, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_II_of_Prussia">Frederick the Great</name> remained unconquered. This result was
                                partly due to the English alliance, partly to the incapable French generals, and partly to the state of internal politics in
                                Russia. The treaties of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763)">Paris (February 10, 1763)</title> and

                                in the history of Europe. By the first Great Britain emerged from the war an imperial power with possessions all over the world,
                                by the second Prussia was recognized as the equal of Austria in Europe.</p>

                            <p>No sooner was the Seven Years' War ended than France and Spain, having made the third <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacte_de_Famille">family compact</title> in 1761 (the other two were signed in 1733 and
                                1743), prepared to take revenge upon Great Britain at the first favourable opportunity. The result of this determination, and of
                                Great Britain's absorption in internal politics, was that Russia, Prussia and Austria were enabled to carry out the first
                                partition of Poland in 1772. The entry of France into the American war of independence rendered it impossible for <name type="person" key="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II.</name>, single-handed, to carry out his project of exchanging
                                the Austrian Netherlands for <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name>, and he was compelled,
                                after a short war, to give up for the time his project and to agree to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Teschen">the treaty of Teschen</title> (1779). The continuance of the American
                                War proved of great value to Russia and enhanced her position in Europe. Not only had she, together with France, brought about
                                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Teschen">the treaty of Teschen</title>, but in 1780 she headed <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_League_of_Armed_Neutrality">the league of armed neutrality</title>, and between 1780
                                and 1784 annexed <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crimea">the Crimea</name>. The conclusion of the war of
                                American Independence enabled Great Britain to regain her influence in Europe, and when Russia and Austria combined to attack
                                Turkey, and when France threatened to re-establish her influence in Holland, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> formed with the Prussian king and the stadtholder the

                                the ensuing four years the influence of that alliance made itself felt in an unmistakable way. All hope of the establishment of
                                French influence in Holland was destroyed; Denmark was forced to relinquish an attack on Sweden, then at war with Russia ; and

                                succeeded <name type="person" key="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II.</name> as emperor in 1790, the revolution in the
                                Netherlands was brought to an end. Moreover, through the influence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Leopold</name> the hostility of Prussia to Austria was
                                removed, and the two powers in July 1790 made <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Reichenbach_(1790)">the treaty
                                    of Reichenbach</title>. Great Britain, the chief member of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1788)">the Triple Alliance</name>, had supported the pacific solution of
                                all these questions so menacing to European peace, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> was aided in his policy by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the emperor Leopold</name>, who in 1791 made <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Sistova">the treaty of Sistova</title> with the Turks.

                                till the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Waterloo,_Belgium">Waterloo</name>. While the east of
                                Europe was engaged in war, and while <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1788)">the
                                    Triple Alliance</name> was busy attempting to restore peace to Europe, the French Revolution had broken out in 1789. The
                                assistance given by France to the American colonists had brought the country to bankruptcy, and no course was left to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_XVI_of_France">Louis XVI.</name> except to summon <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_States-General">the states-general</name> in May 1789. In that
                                year a revolution against the reforms of <name type="person" key="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II.</name> had taken
                                place in the Netherlands, and a revolution was being prepared in Poland for the overthrow of the aristocratic constitution and
                                for the establishment of an hereditary monarchy. At first the revolution in France was entirely occupied with internal reforms,
                                but after the dissolution of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Constituent_Assembly">the
                                    Constituent Assembly</name> in September 1791 the Girondists, whose influence became paramount, determined by the advice of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques_Pierre_Brissot">Brissot</name> to insist upon a policy of
                                menace towards <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> which would
                                inevitably lead to war. War would, they hoped, result in the downfall of monarchy in France. On the other hand, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gilbert_du_Motier,_marquis_de_Lafayette">Lafayette</name> and his party
                                advocated war on the ground that it would strengthen the cause of monarchy. In April 1792 war was accordingly declared upon
                                Austria, then in alliance with Prussia. After a short period of failure the French in September won the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Valmy">Valmy</name>, and in November the battle of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jemappes">Jemappes</name>. French armies advanced to the Rhine, Belgium was occupied, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scheldt">the Scheldt</name> was declared open, and Holland was threatened. In
                                consequence of the danger to Holland, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name>
                                adopted a warlike tone, and in February 1793 France declared war upon Great Britain. In that war Spain, Sardinia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tuscany">Tuscany</name> joined, so that France was practically fighting all
                                Europe. Nevertheless, owing to the want of union among the allies, to the Polish questions which distracted Prussia and Austria,
                                and to the determination and patriotism of all classes in France, the allies were discomfited and the league of powers broken up
                                in 1795, when <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Basel">the treaties of Basel</title> were made. Only Great
                                Britain, Austria and Sardinia remained in arms against France, which was till 1799 ruled by <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Directory">the Directory</name>. The next few years witnessed a series of most
                                startling events. The successes of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon
                                    Bonaparte</name> in the Italian campaigns of 1797 and 1798 led to <title>the peace of Cherasco</title> with Sardinia, <pb n="933" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0933.png"/> and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Campo_Formio">the peace of Campo Formio</title> with
                                Austria. Only Great Britain remained at war with France. In 1799, taking advantage of the absence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> in Egypt, <title>the Second treaties of
                                    Coalition</title> was formed by Russia, Great Britain and Austria. Though the French were driven from Italy, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/André_Masséna">Masséna</name> defeated the Russians in Switzerland, and the
                                English were forced to retire from Holland. The return of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> from Egypt was followed by the establishment of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Consulate">the Consulate</name> in November 1799, by the
                                overthrow of the Austrians at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinetta_Marengo">Marengo</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hohenlinden">Hohenlinden</name>, by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Lunéville">the treaty of Lunéville</title> with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">the emperor</name>, and by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Amiens">the treaty of Amiens</title> in 1802 with the English government.

                            <p>Up to this point the Revolution may be said to have benefited Europe and to have shaken to its base the 18th-century ideas of
                                government. During the years succeeding <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Campo_Formio">the peace of Campo
                                    Formio</title> a revolution was effected in Germany. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">The Holy Roman Empire</name> had become an anachronism, and as soon as
                                France became possessed of the left bank of the Rhine it was obvious that the imperial constitution required revision. The
                                jealousies existing among the German princes and the overthrow of Austria at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavkov_u_Brna">Austerlitz</name> enabled <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> to carry out a revolution in Germany according to his
                                own ideas. At first, in 1804, new arrangements were made with regard to the character and formation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstag_(institution)">the diet</name>. The constitution of that assembly was so altered
                                that a Protestant majority free from Austrian influence was now assured. The middle states, such as Prussia, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baden">Baden</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bavaria">Bavaria</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanover">Hanover</name> received additions of territory, taken either from the
                                ecclesiastical states or from the lands belonging to the imperial knights. After <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavkov_u_Brna">Austerlitz</name>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> in 1806 established <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confederation_of_the_Rhine">the Confederation of the Rhine</name>, and

                                end. A great European revolution had been now effected, but much remained to be done before a feeling of nationality could be
                                aroused among the people of central Europe.</p>

                            <p>Already before <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Amiens">the peace of Amiens</title>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name> had tried to stir up national feeling
                                in Austria and Prussia, the means which he suggested for opposing <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> being in great measure those which were adopted in
                                1813 and 1814. But during <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Pitt_the_Younger">Pitt</name>'s lifetime
                                central Europe was not moved by any feeling of nationality or of patriotism. During the war of the Second Coalition in 1799
                                Austria had acted without any regard for her allies, while Prussia, from motives of jealousy of and from want of confidence in
                                Austria, had refused to move. It was not till the small states which hitherto had formed independent units had been destroyed
                                and Austria and Prussia trampled under foot by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> that a strong national spirit in Germany was evoked. Until <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaties_of_Tilsit">the treaty of Tilsit</title> had been signed in 1807 there was no
                                visible growth of a national uprising in any part of Europe. During the intervening years Prussia had been crushed at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jena">Jena</name> and her kingdom cut short (1806), while <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">Alexander I. of Russia</name>, after a fierce campaign against <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>, had agreed in 1807 to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaties_of_Tilsit">the treaty of Tilsit</title>, which apparently placed Europe at the
                                feet of France and Russia. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> was, as he
                                thought, now in a position to bring about the humiliation of Great Britain. Already in November 1806, realizing that he could
                                not ruin England by direct invasion, he had issued the first <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin_Decree">Berlin
                                    Decree</title>, which ordered the exclusion of British goods from the continent. The Continental System necessitated by the
                                victory of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_Trafalgar">Trafalgar</name> was thus definitely set up.
                                After <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sovetsk,_Kaliningrad_Oblast">Tilsit</name> he proposed to become
                                supreme in the Baltic, and, by securing the dependence of Spain and Portugal, to dominate the Mediterranean, and to resume his
                                plans for conquests in the East, and for the destruction of the British power in India. Thus the effects of the British naval
                                victories of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abu_Qir_Bay">the Nile</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_Trafalgar">Trafalgar</name> would be completely nullified, the Mediterranean would be
                                closed to British ships, Great Britain's Indian possessions would be lost, and Great Britain herself would be forced by
                                starvation into surrender. Fortunately for Europe various circumstances hindered the realization of these ambitious schemes.
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">Alexander</name>, who feared that the French
                                emperor desired <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name>, never proved a very
                                helpful ally, the measures taken by Great Britain seriously interfered with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s schemes, and, before he had subjugated Spain, first
                                Austria in 1809 and then Russia in 1812 offered an active resistance to his projects. The first note of opposition to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s plans was struck by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Canning">Canning</name>, when in 1807 he carried off the Danish fleet
                                to England. Then the British fleet conveyed to Brazil in safety the Portuguese royal family when Portugal was invaded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Andoche_Junot">Junot</name>, while the surrender of 30,000 French troops
                                at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bailén">Baylen</name> in July 1808, which was followed in August by
                                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Convention_of_Sintra">the convention of Cintra</title>, indicated that Spanish
                                patriotism was, when roused, as effective as in the days of the Spanish Succession War. Austria was the first country to follow
                                the example of Spain, and though she was defeated at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Deutsch-Wagram">Wagram</name> and forced to accept <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s hard terms, the national feeling aroused in Germany in 1809 rapidly developed. But <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> was apparently unconscious of the growth and
                                importance of a national sentiment in any of the subject countries. In 1810 he had married <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marie_Louise,_Duchess_of_Parma">Marie Louise of Austria</name>, on the 20th of March 1811 a
                                son was born to him, and he now seems to have resolved upon the establishment of a strictly hereditary empire with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> its capital and Rome its second city. In extent, his
                                empire would be vaster than that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>, and
                                the pope was to be completely subordinate to the emperor. This conception of the establishment of a reformed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman Empire</name> with its centre at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> did not appear unrealizable in 1811 when everything seemed
                                to favour the new <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s power was apparently securely established, and
                                during the years 1810 and 1811 he was again returning to his vast oriental designs. A sudden check, however, was about to be
                                placed upon his ambitious schemes.</p>

                                which was encouraged by the example of Spain. No greater mistake was ever made by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> than when, ignoring the strength of the Spanish
                                resistance, the development of a national movement in Germany, he resolved to enter upon the Russian campaign and to march to

                                patriotism in Italy, Germany, Russia and Spain. It was at least realized by the nations of continental Europe, what had long
                                been apparent to Englishmen, that a nation to be strong must be united. To <q>" the subversive cosmopolitanism "</q> of the
                                French Revolution was now opposed the modern idea of nationality, against which the Napoleonic legions hurled themselves in

                            <p>The downfall of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> involved that of the
                                political system of Europe which he had constructed. The changes wrought by the revolutionary period in the old states system
                                were, however, too profound to admit of any attempt at a complete restoration, even had the interests of the allied powers been
                                consistent with such a course. The object of the four great powers in whose hands the settlement of Europe now lay, was rather,
                                after taking precautions to confine France within her <q>" legitimate boundaries,"</q> to arrange such a <q>" just equilibrium
                                    "</q> in Europe that no individual state should for the future be in a position to overset the balance of power. The first
                                object was to be attained by the re-establishment of the ancient dynasty in France, as a guarantee to Europe against a renewal
                                of the revolutionary propaganda; the second was the work of the congress of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name>, by which, between September 1814 and June 1815, the reconstruction
                                of Europe was taken in hand. The opening of the congress, in which for the first time all Europe seemed to be united for the
                                friendly settlement of common <pb n="934" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0934.png"/> interests, was hailed as the dawn of a new era. In a sense it was so; but hardly in
                                the manner nor to the degree that some had hoped. In its councils the arts of the old diplomacy, still inspired by the
                                traditional principles or lack of principles, were directed to the old ends ; and the world, as though the popular upheaval of
                                the Revolution had never been, was treated as real estate to be parcelled out by the executors of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s empire among sovereigns by divine right, regardless
                                of the wishes of the populations, which figured in the protocols merely as numbers to be balanced and bartered one against the
                                other.</p>

                                possibilities of quarrels. Of these the most dangerous was that provoked by the resolution of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the emperor Alexander I.</name> at all costs to keep the former

                                the other great powers were equally determined to frustrate, all but led to war, and by a secret treaty signed on the 3rd of
                                January 1815, Great Britain, France, and Austria agreed to make common cause in that event against Russia and Prussia. It needed

                                pre-revolutionary system, that the greatest changes were made. No attempt, indeed, was made to restore <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Holy Roman Empire</name>, in spite of the protest of the pope

                                Germany was reconstituted as a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Confederation">a
                                    confederation</name> of sovereign states, in which all the former members of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holy_Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> which had survived the revolutionary epoch found a
                                place (see GERMANY). Austria, in virtue of the imperial tradition of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Habsburg">the house of Habsburg</name>, received the presidency of the federal
                                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstag_(institution)">diet</name>; but the bulk of her

                                at the congress. In Italy <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Lombardy-Venetia">Lombardo-Venetia</name> was erected into a kingdom under the Austrian crown; while the dynastic settlements in the other
                                Italian states tended to make Austrian influence supreme in the peninsula (see ITALY). In return for this, Austria surrendered
                                her claim to her former possessions in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Low_Countries">the Low

                                assigned to Prussia, an arrangement pregnant with momentous issues. In compensation for her disappointment in the matter of

                            <p>Of great importance were the changes effected in the north and east of Europe.

                                Britain to bring them into discussion. But the concessions made to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the emperor Alexander I.</name> elsewhere represented a notable
                                advance in the European position of Russia. The possession of Finland, conquered from the Swedes in 1808, was confirmed to her:
                                and, above all, the erection of the former <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Warsaw">grand-duchy of

                                to threaten the Polish possessions of Austria and Prussia by setting up a quasi-independent Poland as a centre of attraction to
                                the scattered elements of the Polish nation; though in the sequel the establishment of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kraków">the city of Cracow</name> and its territory as an independent <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Free_City_of_Kraków">republic</name>, to avoid the difficult question of
                                its assignment elsewhere, proved a more fruitful source of nationalist unrest. In the north the settlement confirmed by the
                                congress marked the definite withdrawal of the Scandinavian Powers from any active influence on the affairs of the continent.

                            <p>This was, in effect, an attempt to apply the principle of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carlsbad_Decrees">the Carlsbad
                                    Decrees</title> to all the world; and, had the attempt succeeded, all Europe would have been turned into a confederation on
                                the model of that of Germany; for a political alliance, charged with the safeguarding of the territorial settlement defined by
                                treaty, would have been substituted by a central diet of the great powers, armed with undefined authority ; and the sovereign
                                independence of the nations would have been at an end. To any such principle, and therefore to the protocol in which it was
                                embodied, Great Britain offered an uncompromising opposition. In vain <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Klemens_Wenzel,_Prince_von_Metternich">Metternich</name> urged upon <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Stewart,_Viscount_Castlereagh">Castlereagh</name> that the protocol was but the
                                logical conclusion drawn from premises to which he was already committed ; for, if the alliance was to be effective in
                                maintaining peace, it must interfere wherever and whenever peace should be threatened, and therefore to crush internal
                                revolutions which could not but have an external result. The logic was perfect; the proposition that on which every <q>" project
                                    of peace "</q> must eventually break. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Stewart,_Viscount_Castlereagh">Castlereagh</name>'s reply was, in brief, that Great
                                Britain could never admit a principle which she would not in any circumstances allow to be applied in her own case.</p>

                                maintain the integrity of Turkey; both saw that this integrity was in the greatest peril owing to the possible intervention of
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the Orthodox tsar</name> in favour of his
                                co-religionists in revolt; and both agreed that the best means of preventing such intervention was to bind <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the Russian emperor</name> to the European concert by using his

                                powers of the alliance. She shared indeed with France and Austria the strenuous objection to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_I_of_Russia">the emperor Alexander</name>'s proposal to march 150,000 Russians
                                into <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piedmont">Piedmont</name> in order to deal with Jacobinism whether in
                                France or Spain ; but she protested equally strenuously against the counterproposal of France, which was ultimately adopted,
                                that a French army should march into Spain to liberate <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_VII_of_Spain">the king</name> from his constitutional fetters in the name of

                                protested, through <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington">Wellington</name>, as British plenipotentiary at the congress, against the whole principle of intervention ; and when, in

                                proclaimed to all the world.

                                Greece. Other forces making for political change were simultaneously at work. The peace secured by the concert of the powers had

                                territorial settlement of 1815. In Great Britain the agitation of the disfranchised middle classes, which seemed to threaten a
                                violent revolution, ended in 1832 in the passing of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reform_Act_1832">the Reform

                            <p>The easy success of the revolutions in the west of Europe had been due, not to any reluctance of the reactionary powers to
                                interfere on the basis of the old agreements, but to their preoccupation with the national revolt in Poland (q.v). In view of
                                this, and of the attitude of Great Britain, they had to recognize the title of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis-Philippe_d'Orléans,_King_of_the_French">Louis Philippe</name> as king of the French,

                                fateful changes were in progress. These were determined, broadly speaking, by the two main questions that dominated
                                international politics between the years 1831 and 1841: <list>

                                checkmated by a politic breach, on behalf of the Portuguese Liberals, of the British principle of non-intervention, and finally
                                the chief cause of offence had been removed, in 1827, by the withdrawal of the French army of occupation from Spain. In the

                                to be realized when the Russo - Turkish campaigns of 1828-29 issued in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Adrianople">the treaty of Adrianople</title> (September 14, 1829) and the

                                prepared, might but for this have been detached and spasmodic. It was this simultaneity which gave to the revolutions of 1848
                                their European character and their formidable force. They were the outcome of various, dissimilar and sometimes contradictory

                            <p>That, in the event, the revolutions of 1848 left the territorial settlement of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name> intact, was due in the main to the marvellous resisting power of

                                soon clear that the unanimity was more apparent than real. The victory of the democratic forces had been too easy, too seemingly
                                overwhelming; the establishment of the constitutional principle in the main centres of autocracy seemed to make common action
                                against the powers of reaction of secondary importance, and free play was allowed to the racial and national antagonisms that
                                had been present from the first. The battle of German, as well as of Italian, liberty was being fought out on the plains of

                                certainly at the expense of the established order. At the outset, indeed, it was his policy to pose as its custodian. To

                                    IX.</name> against the Italian Liberals; but otherwise he proclaimed aloud his devotion to the arts of peace. A period of
                                rapid material expansion succeeded the unrest of the revolutionary years ; engineers and men of science were quickly producing a
                                change in all the material conditions of life, greater than could have been effected by any political revolution; especially the
                                face of Europe was gradually being covered with a network of railways, which it was hoped would draw the European nations not
                                only materially but morally closer together. The first universal exhibition, opened under the auspices of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert,_Prince_Consort">the prince consort</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> in 1851, was intended to advertise and consecrate the dawn of a new
                                era of international peace and goodwill. The Crystal Palace at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sydenham_Hill">Sydenham</name>, once hailed as the <q>" bright Koh-i-nur of the West,"</q>
                                remains the dismal monument of a hope so soon to be belied by the hard logic of events. For no period since 1815 has been so
                                occupied with wars and the rumours of war as the twenty years that followed the opening of this great temple of peace.</p>

                            <p>One question, that of the ultimate destination of the duchies of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Schleswig">Schleswig</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holstein-Glückstadt">Holstein</name>, which threatened the tranquillity of the West, was
                                temporarily settled by the conference of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> in 1852 (see
                                SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN QUESTION). But about the same time anxious watchers noticed on the political horizon in the East a cloud, no
                                bigger than a man's hand, that threatened a serious storm. At first this was no more than a quarrel between Greek and Latin
                                monks about the custody of certain holy places and things in Palestine. <pb n="940" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0940.png"/> It soon, however, became clear that behind
                                these insignificant combatants loomed the figures of the emperors of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_I_of_Russia">Russia</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">France</name>. The motives that induced <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> to take up the cause of the rights of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Latin church</name> in this matter were
                                partly political, partly personal. He resented <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_I_of_Russia">the
                                    tsar</name>'s attitude towards himself; he wished to gain the firm support of the clergy for his throne; he desired to win
                                prestige for himself and his dynasty by reasserting the traditional influence of France in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name>. The events that led up to the Crimean War, and
                                those of the war itself, are told elsewhere (see CRIMEAN WAR). Great Britain had been drawn into the war by her traditional
                                policy of preserving <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name> as a
                                barrier against the advance of Russia to the Mediterranean and the consequent danger to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Empire">the British empire</name> in India. It is now generally conceded that, so
                                far as these objects were concerned, the war was a tragic mistake. The hopes that were built on the capacity of Turkey to reform
                                itself were disappointed; the restrictions imposed upon Russia were repudiated at the first opportunity, during the
                                Franco-German War in 1870; and the results of the Russo-Turkish War of 1876 have shown that a far more effective barrier against
                                Russia than the weakened <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman empire</name> has
                                been furnished by the young and vigorous national states of the Balkan Peninsula. None the less, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Paris_(1856)">the treaty of Paris (1856)</title>, by which the war was closed,
                                marks an important epoch in the diplomatic history of Europe ; and it is impossible to say that the blood spilled in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crimea">the Crimea</name> was wholly wasted. At the time the main success of
                                the allied powers seemed to be in the thrusting back of Russia from the Danube by the cession of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name>, the extinction of Russian sea-power in the Black Sea, the

                                congress of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> lies in the impetus given by it to the
                                development of an effective international law. The concert of Europe was consecrated anew by the solemn admission of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman empire</name> to an equality of <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                obligations of Europe towards it. The congress, moreover, acted in some sort as the legislative body of Europe; it established
                                the principle of the free navigation of the Danube and of the right of all nations to carry their commerce into the Black Sea ;
                                by a declaration, signed by all the powers present, it abolished the practice of granting letters of marque to privateers in war
                                time. The question was even discussed of establishing some sanction by which the rules of international law agreed upon should
                                be enforced upon recalcitrant states ; and, though nothing was settled, a <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                death by the war; Austria was discredited and isolated owing to the dubious part she had played in it; Prussia had not recovered
                                from the humiliation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olomouc">Olmütz</name>; Great Britain was soon
                                plunged into the critical struggle of the Indian Mutiny. The time was obviously opportune for the realization of some of the
                                aspirations implied in the Napoleonic idea. The opportunity came from the side of Italy. By sending Sardinian troops to fight in

                                powers—a right of which he had made use at the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> congress
                                to denounce before all Europe the Austrian misrule in Italy. The Italian unionists were at one with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> in desiring to overset <q>" the treaties "</q> ;
                                and the Franco- Italian alliance which, in 1859, drove the Austrians out of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombardy">Lombardy</name> and established the nucleus of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)">the Italian kingdom</name> was the beginning of a process
                                which, within twelve years, was to change the balance of Europe. It was ominous of the future that it was largely the menace of
                                Prussian intervention that persuaded <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> to conclude the armistice of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Villafranca_di_Verona">Villafranca</name> (July 11, 1859), which, contrary to his agreement with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Victor_Emmanuel_II_of_Italy">Victor Emmanuel</name>, left <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice">Venice</name> to the Austrians. In spite of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Zürich">the peace of Zürich</title> (November 10), indeed, the union of Italy
                                continued during the succeeding years, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nice">Nice</name> were the reward of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">the French emperor</name>'s connivance (see ITALY). France thus
                                once more gained her <q>" natural frontier "</q> of the Alps ; the question was whether she would be able to regain her other
                                natural frontier on the Rhine. The times were not-unpropitious for an enterprise which was undoubtedly one of the main objects
                                of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name>'s policy. The European concert
                                had ceased to exist as an effective force ; the treaties had been violated with impunity ; in Germany, where the tension between
                                the two great powers had not been eased by Prussia's dubious attitude during the war, there was little prospect of a united
                                opposition to French aggression, and the conditions seemed highly favourable for reviving the traditional policy of exploiting
                                German disunion for the aggrandizement of France. Prussia was arming, but her armaments were directed not against <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> but against Austria; and the
                                beginning of the reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">William I.</name>, who
                                had become regent in 1858 and king in 1861, pointed to the development of a situation in which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">the French emperor</name> would once again become the arbiter of
                                Germany. On the 29th of March 1862 Prussia signed a commercial treaty with France on a basis that involved the exclusion of
                                Austria from <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zollverein">the Zollverein</name>, and replied to the

                            <p>The final act in this long rivalry began with the opening up of the Schleswig-Holstein question on the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_VII_of_Denmark">Frederick VII. of Denmark</name> and the accession

                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_IX_of_Denmark">Christian IX.</name> (November 15, 1863). The
                                German claim to the Elbe duchies, the Danish claim to least <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duchy_of_Schleswig">Schleswig</name> as an integral part of the northern kingdom, were but
                                subordinate issues of questions far more fateful, the developments of which once more illustrated the hopeless enfeeblement of
                                the idea of the European concert. In the struggle for the possession of the duchies the general sentiment of Germany was on one
                                side, that of Europe on the other. By the protocol of 1852 the duchies had been treated as an integral part of Denmark, and
                                France and Great Britain, as signatory powers, alike protested against the action <pb n="941" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0941.png"/> of Austria and Prussia in
                                asserting the German claim by force of arms. But, as in the case of Poland, protests were not followed by action ; <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> in the end contented himself with
                                proposing his favourite <q>" Napoleonic idea "</q> of a plebiscite, to discover the wishes of the populations concerned; <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston">Palmerston</name>, who realized
                                some of the important issues involved, allowed his warlike attitude, under exalted influences, to evaporate in words. Thus Great
                                Britain earned the lasting resentment of Germans, without succeeding in preventing the establishment of German sea-power in the
                                Baltic. For the Prussian war-harbour of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiel">Kiel</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kiel_Canal">the Kiel canal</name> were in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s mind from the outset. Throughout he intended to make
                                the duchies a part of Prussia and to use the whole question as a means for the solution of that of Germany. The Austro-Prussian
                                War of 1866 grew inevitably out of the Dano-German War of 1864 ; and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Prague_(1866)">the treaty of Prague</title> (Aug. 23, 1866), which excluded

                                arbiter between exhausted combatants. The sudden menace of the new German power alarmed him, and he sought to secure the Rhine
                                frontier for France, by negotiations with Prussia, in the form of <q>" compensations "</q> at the expense of the South German
                                states. He succeeded only in placing a fresh weapon in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s hands. The communication of the French overtures to the South German courts was enough to throw them into
                                the arms of Prussia; and treaties of offensive and defensive alliance were signed in August 1866 between Prussia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name> (3rd), <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baden">Baden</name> (17th), and Bavaria (22nd), by which the king of Prussia was to receive

                            <p>Meanwhile public feeling in France had become seriously excited by this sudden menace of a hostile power on her eastern frontier,
                                and this excitement was raised to fever heat when it became known that the vacant throne of Spain had been offered to and
                                accepted by a prince of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Hohenzollern">the house of

                                had become hopelessly discredited by the successive fiascos in Poland, Mexico and Germany, and even the establishment of a
                                liberal constitution in 1869 could not avail to restore public confidence in him. He knew the risk he ran in challenging a
                                conflict with a power whose military efficiency had been so strikingly displayed; but by refusing to do so, in the excited state
                                of public feeling, he would have risked his throne. He reckoned on the traditional jealousy of the South German states for
                                Prussia and their traditional friendship with France; he was assured, too, of the support of Austria, in the event of a
                                victorious opening of the campaign. On the other hand <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> was bent on war, which, in accordance with his policy of <q>" blood and iron,"</q> he believed to be the
                                sole effective means of binding the heterogeneous elements of Germany into a coherent whole. The device of the <q>" Ems
                                    telegrams "</q> (see BISMARCK) was sufficient to end the hesitations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon</name> by giving an irresistible volume to the cry of the

                            <p>By the Franco-German War of 1870-71 and the creation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">the German empire</name> the political condition of Europe was profoundly changed. Germany became for a time the leading
                                power on the continent of Europe, and German statesmanship had to devise means for preventing, until the new edifice was
                                thoroughly consolidated, the formation of a hostile coalition of jealous rivals. The first thing to be done in this direction
                                was to secure the support of Russia and Austria to the new order of things.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Russia there was little cause for apprehension. She had aided <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> to carry out his audacious schemes in the past, and
                                there was no reason to suppose that she would change her policy in the immediate future. The <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                and England, yielding to popular excitement, made strong diplomatic representations to Russia in favour of the Poles, whereas
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> not only refused to join in the

                                on the frontiers should aid each other in suppressing the disturbances. From that time the friendship ripened steadily. The
                                relations between the two powers were not, it is true, always without a cloud. More than once the bold designs of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> caused uneasiness and dissatisfaction in
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>, especially during the Schleswig-
                                Holstein complications of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian conflict of 1866; but the wily statesman of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>, partly by argument and partly by dexterously manipulating the mutual
                                trust and affection between the two sovereigns, always succeeded in having his own way without producing a rupture, so that
                                during the Franco-German War of 1870-71 Russia maintained an extremely benevolent neutrality, and prevented Austria and Italy
                                from taking part in the struggle. So benevolent was the neutrality that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor William</name> at the end of the campaign felt
                                constrained to write to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> that he

                                programme, the permanent conciliation of Austria, was not so easily carried out. Austria had been the great sufferer, more
                                perhaps even than France, from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s
                                aggressive policy. For generations she had resisted strenuously and successfully the efforts of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Hohenzollern">the Hohenzollerns</name> to play the leading part in Germany, and
                                she had always considered her own influence in Germany as essential to the maintenance of her position as a first-class power.
                                By the disastrous campaign of 1866 and the consequent <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peace_of_Prague_(1866)">treaty of
                                    Prague</title>, Austria had been formally excluded from all direct influence in German affairs. With these events still

                                could hardly be expected to support the new empire created by his rival at Austria's expense, and it was known that on the eve
                                of the Franco-German War he had been negotiating with the French government for a combined attack on Prussia. To an ordinary

                                    the way for attaining his object. <quote>" With regard to Austria," he himself explained on one occasion, " I had two

                                        future reconciliation when the fire of revenge had died out. I chose the latter course, because the former would have
                                        been the greatest possible act of folly. Supposing that Austria had disappeared, consider the consequences."</quote> He
                                    then described very graphically those probable consequences, and drew the conclusion: <quote>" for the sake of our own life
                                        Austria must live. I had no hesitation, therefore, and ever since 1866 my constant effort has been to stitch up the

                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">The tsar</name>, on hearing privately of the intended meeting, gave
                                a hint to <name type="person">Prince Reuss</name>, the German ambassador, that he expected an invitation, and was invited
                                accordingly. The meeting of the three sovereigns took place at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> at the end of August 1872. The three ministers, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Prince Bismarck</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Count Andrássy</name>, held daily conferences, on the basis that the chief
                                aim in view should be the maintenance of peace in Europe, and that in all important international affairs the three powers
                                should consult with each other and act in concert. As a result of three days' consultation <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the Three Emperors' League</name> was founded, without any
                                formal treaty being signed. In this way the danger of a powerful coalition being formed against the young German empire was
                                averted, for in the event of a conflict with France, Germany could count on at least the benevolent neutrality of Russia and
                                Austria, and from the other powers she had nothing to fear. What ulterior designs <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> may have had in forming <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the league</name>, or <q>" Alliance "</q> as it is often

                            <p>For more than two years there was an outward appearance of extreme cordiality between the three powers. They acted together
                                diplomatically, and on all suitable occasions the three allied monarchs exchanged visits and sent each other congratulations and
                                good wishes. There was, however, from the beginning very little genuine confidence between them. Before the breaking up of the
                                conferences at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">Alexander II.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">his chancellor</name> had conversations with the Erench ambassador, in
                                which they not only showed that they had suspicions of future aggressive designs on the part of Germany, but also gave an
                                assurance that so long as France fulfilled her engagements to Germany she had nothing to fear. A few months later, when <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor William</name> paid his return visit
                                to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>, a defensive convention was concluded by the two
                                monarchs behind the back of their Austrian ally. Without knowing anything about the existence of this convention, the Austrian
                                ally did not feel comfortable in his new position. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna">Vienna</name>
                                the old anti-Prussian feeling was still strong. The so-called party of the archdukes and the military resisted the policy of

                                </foreign>, the latent germs of dissension remained hidden from the outside world, but as soon as the temporary
                                state of political quietude was replaced by a certain amount of activity and initiative, they forced their way to the surface.
                                No one of the three powers regarded the <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                the rapid financial and military recovery of France, and voices were heard suggesting that a new campaign and a bigger war

                                a desire to obtain in the Balkan Peninsula, in accordance with the suggestion of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>, compensation for the losses in Italy and Germany. Thus
                                each of the members of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the league</name>
                                was hatching secretly a little aggressive scheme for its own benefit, and the danger for the rest of Europe lay in the
                                possibility of their reconciling their schemes so far as to admit of an agreement for action in common. Fortunately for the
                                onlookers there were important conflicting interests, and the task of reconciling them was extremely difficult, as the

                            <p>The first of the three powers to move was Germany. In February 1875 <name type="person">M. de Radowitz</name> was despatched to
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name> on a secret mission in order to
                                discover whether, in the event of hostilities between Germany and France, Russia would undertake to maintain a neutral attitude
                                as she had done in 1870-1871; in that case Germany might be relied on to co-operate with her in her great designs in the East.
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name> did not take the bait with
                                the alacrity that was expected. Having overcome in some measure his hatred of Austria, which had distorted for so many years his
                                political vision, he had come to understand that it was not for the interests of his own country to have as neighbour a powerful
                                united Germany instead of a weak confederation of small states, and he now perceived that it would be a grave error of policy to
                                allow Germany to destroy still more to her own advantage the balance of power in Europe by permanently weakening France. No
                                doubt he desired to recover the lost portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name> and to raise Russian prestige in the East, but he did not wish to run the risk of exciting a great
                                European war, and he believed that what he desired might be effected without war by the diplomatic skill which had warded off
                                European intervention during the Polish troubles of 1863, and had recovered for Russia her freedom of action in the Black Sea
                                during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. In reply, therefore, to <name type="person">M. de Radowitz</name>'s inquiries and
                                suggestions, he declared that the Russian court fostered no ambitious designs in the East or in the West, and desired only peace
                                and the maintenance of the <foreign xml:lang="la">

                                continued, and the French government became thoroughly alarmed. <name type="person">General Leflô</name>, the French ambassador
                                in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>, was instructed to sound the

A few days later <name type="person">General Leflô</name> received similar assurances from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the emperor</name> himself, and about the same time the British
                                government volunteered to work likewise in the cause of peace. Representations were accordingly made by both governments during
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s visit to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name>, and both <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor William</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">his chancellor</name> declared that there was no intention of attacking
                                France. The danger of war, which the well-informed German press believed to be " in sight," was thus averted, but the incident

                                Adriatic coast. A European concert was formed for the purpose of settling the disturbance by means of local administrative
                                reforms, but the efforts of the powers failed, because the insurgents hoped to obtain complete liberation from Turkish rule; and

                                government allowed volunteers to be recruited in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MoSCoW">Moscow</name> and
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Petersburg">St Petersburg</name>, and the Russian <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mikhail_Chernyayev">general Chernayev</name>, who had distinguished himself
                                in Central Asia, was appointed to the <pb n="944" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0944.png"/> command of the Servian army. When the ball had thus been set rolling, the
                                two powers chiefly concerned considered that the time had come for embodying the result of their informal confidential
                                pourparlers in a secret agreement, which is known as <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstadt_Agreement">the
                                    convention of Reichstadt</title>, because it was signed at a meeting of the two emperors in the little Bohemian town of that
                                name. It bore the date of the 8th of July 1876—exactly a week after Servia and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montenegro">Montenegro</name> had declared war—and it contained the following stipulations: <list>
                                    <item>(1) That so long as the struggle which had just begun remained undecided, the two sovereigns should refrain from
                                        interference, and that in the event of the principalities being defeated, any modification of the territorial or

                                        </foreign> to their detriment should be prevented
                                        ;</item>
                                    <item>(2) that in the event of the principalities proving victorious, and territorial changes taking place, Austria should
                                        claim compensation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Russia should demand the restitution of the portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name> which she had lost by the Crimean
                                        War;</item>
                                    <item>(3) that in the event of the collapse of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the
                                            Ottoman empire</name>, the two powers should act together to create autonomous principalities in European Turkey, to
                                        unite <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly">Thessaly</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name> to Greece, and to proclaim <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> a free town</item>
                                </list>. The contracting parties evidently expected that the two principalities would be victorious in their struggle with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name>, and that the compensations mentioned
                                would be secured without a great European war. Their expectations were disappointed. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montenegro">Montenegro</name> made a brave stand against superior forces, but before five
                                months had passed Servia was at the mercy of the Turkish army, and Russia had to come to the assistance of her protégé. A
                                Russian ultimatum stopped the advance of the Turks on <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgrade">Belgrade</name>, and an armistice, subsequently transformed into a peace, was signed.</p>

                            <p>Russia and Austria had now to choose between abandoning their schemes and adopting some other course of action, and unforeseen
                                incidents contributed towards making them select the latter alternative. In June 1876 an attempt at insurrection in Bulgaria had
                                been repressed with savage brutality by the Turks, and the details, as they became known some weeks later, produced much
                                indignation all over Europe. In England the excitement, fanned by the eloquence of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Gladstone">Gladstone</name>, became intense, and compelled the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Disraeli</name> cabinet to take part, very reluctantly, in a diplomatic
                                campaign, with the object of imposing radical reforms on Turkey. In Russia the excitement and indignation were equally great,
                                and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> gradually formed the resolution
                                that if the powers would not act collectively and energetically, so as to compel <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> to yield, he would undertake the work single-handed. This
                                resolution he announced publicly in a speech delivered at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MoSCoW">Moscow</name> on the 10th of November 1876. The powers did not like the idea of separate Russian action, and in order to
                                prevent it they agreed to hold a conference in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> for the purpose of inducing <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> to introduce the requisite reforms. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">The Porte</name> was at that moment under the influence of popular
                                patriotic excitement which made it indisposed to accept orders, or even well-meant advice, from governments more or less hostile
                                to it, and the inconsiderate mode of procedure suggested by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Pavlovich_Ignatiev">General Ignatiev</name>, and adopted by the other delegates,
                                made it still more unconciliatory. At the first plenary sitting of the conference the proceedings were disturbed by the sound of
                                artillery, and the Turkish representative explained that the salvo was in honour of the new Ottoman constitution, which was
                                being promulgated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name>. The inference
                                suggested was that as Turkey had spontaneously entered on the path of liberal and constitutional reform for all Ottoman
                                subjects, it became superfluous and absurd to talk of small reforms for particular provinces, such as the conference was about
                                to propose. The deliberations continued, but finally <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> refused to accept what the plenipotentiaries considered an irreducible minimum, and the conference broke
                                up without obtaining any practical result. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">The

                            <p>In order to make a successful aggressive move on Turkey, Russia had first of all to secure her rear and flank by an arrangement
                                with her two allies. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> she encountered no
                                difficulties. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had no objection to seeing
                                Russia weaken herself in a struggle with Turkey, provided she did not upset the balance of power in south-eastern Europe, and he
                                felt confident that he could prevent by diplomatic means any such catastrophe. He was inclined, therefore, to encourage rather
                                than restrain the bellicose tendencies of St Petersburg. In Vienna the task of coming to a definite arrangement was much more
                                difficult, and it was only after protracted and laborious negotiations that a convention was concluded on the 15th of January
                                1877, and formally signed three months later. It was a development of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichstadt_Agreement">the agreement of Reichstadt</title>, modified according to the
                                changes in the situation, but retaining the essential principle that in the event of the territorial <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign> being altered, Russia should recover the lost portion of Bessarabia, and Austria
                                should get Bosnia and a part of Herzegovina. Having made these preliminary arrangements, Russia began the campaign
                                simultaneously in Europe and Asia Minor, and after many reverses and enormous sacrifices of blood and treasure, she succeeded in
                                imposing on the Turks the <q>" preliminary peace "</q> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yeşilköy">San
                                    Stefano</name> (3rd March 1878). That peace was negotiated with very little consideration for the interests of the other
                                powers, and as soon as the terms of it became known in Vienna and London there was an outburst of indignation. In negotiating
                                the treaty <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_Pavlovich_Ignatiev">General Ignatiev</name> had ignored
                                the wishes of Austria, and had even, according to the contention of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Andrássy</name>, infringed the convention signed at the beginning of the
                                war. However this may be, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_San_Stefano">the peace of San Stefano</title>
                                brought to the surface the latent conflict of interests between the two empires. Russia's aim was to create a big Bulgaria under
                                the influence of St Petersburg, and to emancipate Servia and Montenegro as far as possible from Austrian influence, whereas
                                Austria objected to the creation of any large Slav stats in the Balkan Peninsula, and insisted on maintaining her influence at
                                Belgrade and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetinje">Tsetigne (Cetinje)</name>. In vain <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name> endeavoured to conciliate Austria and to
                                extract from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Count Andrássy</name> a clear statement of the
                                terms he would accept. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gyula_Andrássy">Count Andrássy</name> was in no
                                hurry to extricate Russia from her difficulties, and suggested that the whole question should be submitted to a European
                                congress. The suggestion was endorsed by Great Britain, which likewise objected to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_San_Stefano">the San Stefano arrangements</title>, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> declined to bring any pressure to bear on the cabinet of

                            <p>Deceived in her expectations of active support from her two allies Russia found herself in an awkward position. From a military
                                point of view it was absolutely necessary for her to come to an arrangement either with Austria or with England, because the
                                communications of her army before Constantinople with its base could be cut by these two powers acting in concert —the land
                                route being dominated by Austria, and the Black Sea route by the British fleet, which was at that time anchored in the Sea of
                                Marmora. As soon, therefore, as the efforts to obtain the support of her two allies against the demands of England had failed,
                                negotiations were opened in London, and on the 30th of May a secret convention was signed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Cecil,_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyotr_Andreyevich_Shuvalov">Count Schuvalov</name>. By that agreement the obstacles to the
                                assembling of the congress were removed. The congress met in Berlin on the 13th of June, and after many prolonged sittings and
                                much secret negotiation <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)">the treaty of Berlin</title> was signed
                                on the 13th of July. By <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)">that treaty</title> the preliminary
                                    <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_San_Stefano">peace of San Stefano</title> was considerably modified. The

                                principality, the part between the Balkans and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhodope_Mountains">the
                                    Rhodope</name> being made into an autonomous province, called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</name>,under a Christian governor named by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> with the assent of the powers, and the

                                remainder of the occupied territory. As a set-off against the large acquisitions of the Slav races, the powers recommended that

                                to secure good administration throughout the whole of Asia Minor by the introduction of reforms under British control, and to
                                prevent the further expansion of Russia in that direction by a defensive alliance with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name>. A <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus_Convention">convention</title> to that effect was duly signed at Constantinople a
                                few days before the meeting of the congress (4th June 1878), but the only part of it which was actually realized was the

                                    <title>treaty of Vienna</title>, had thus been realized. Russia had recovered the lost portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name>, and Austria had practically annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina,
                                though the nominal suzerainty of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> over the
                                two provinces was maintained. But Russia was far from satisfied with the results, which seemed to her not at all commensurate
                                with the sacrifices imposed on her by the war, and her dissatisfaction led to a new grouping of the powers. Before the opening
                                of the Berlin congress <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had announced
                                publicly that he would refrain from taking sides with any of the contending parties, and would confine himself to playing the
                                part of an honest broker. The announcement was received by the Russians with astonishment and indignation. What they expected
                                was not an impartial arbiter, but a cordial and useful friend in need. In 1871 <ref>

                                debt, and when Russia was being compelled to make concessions which she described as incompatible with her dignity, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had nothing better to offer than honest
                                brokerage. The indignation in all classes was intense, and the views commonly held regarding <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s <q>" duplicity "</q> and <q>" treachery "</q> were

                                Berlin and Vienna, though the result was attributed, of course, to different causes, and the danger of serious complications
                                became so great that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> concluded with

                                Russia and France.</p>
                            <p>The causes of the rupture are variously described by the different parties interested. According to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> the Russian government began a venomous campaign against
                                Germany in the press, and collected, with apparently hostile intentions, enormous masses of troops near the German and Austrian
                                frontiers, whilst <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name> adopted in his
                                correspondence with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor William</name>
                                an arrogant and menacing tone which could not be tolerated. On the other hand, the Russians declare that the so-called
                                Press-Campaign was merely the spontaneous public expression of the prevailing disappointment among all classes in Russia, that
                                the military preparations had a purely defensive character, and that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s remarks, which roused <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s ire, did not transgress the limits of friendly
                                expostulation such as sovereigns in close friendly relations might naturally employ. <figure>

                                </figure> Subsequent revelations tend rather to confirm the Russian view. After an exhausting war and without a single powerful
                                ally, Russia was not likely to provoke wantonly a great war with Germany and Austria. The press attacks were not more violent
                                than those which frequently appear in newspapers which draw their inspiration from the German foreign office, and the
                                accusations about the arrogant attitude and menacing tone of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">Alexander II.</name> are not at all in harmony with his known
                                character, and are refuted by the documents since published by <name type="person">Dr Busch</name>. The truth seems to be that
                                the self-willed <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">chancellor</name> was actuated by
                                nervous irritation and personal feeling more than by considerations of statecraft. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">His imperial master</name> was not convinced by his arguments,
                                and showed great reluctance to permit the conclusion of a separate treaty with Austria. Finally, with much searching of heart,
                                he yielded to the importunity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">his minister</name>;
                                but in thus committing an unfriendly act towards his old ally, he so softened the blow that the personal good relations between
                                the two sovereigns suffered merely a momentary interruption. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> himself soon recognized that the permanent estrangement
                                of Russia would be a grave mistake of policy, and the very next year (1880), negotiations for a treaty of defensive alliance
                                between the two cabinets were begun. Nor did the accession to the throne of Russia of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name>, who had long enjoyed the reputation of
                                being systematically hostile to Germans, produce a rupture, as was expected. Six months after <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_II_of_Russia">his father</name>'s death, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the young tsar</name> met <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">the old kaiser</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gdańsk">Danzig</name>
                                <pb n="946" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0946.png"/> (September 1881), and some progress was made towards a complete renewal of the traditional friendship. Immediately
                                afterwards a further step was taken towards re-establishing the old state of things with regard also to Austria. On his return

                                    remembered that he had received some time previously a telegram of congratulation from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria">the emperor Francis Joseph</name>, and he now replied to it

                                    describing <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_I,_German_Emperor">the emperor William</name> as

                            <p>The removal of all immediate danger of a Franco-Russian alliance did not prevent <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> from strengthening in other ways the diplomatic position
                                of Germany, and the result of nis efforts soon became apparent in the alliance of Italy with the two central powers. Ever since
                                the Franco-German War of 1870-71, and more especially since the congress of Berlin in 1878, the Italian government had shown
                                itself restless and undecided in its foreign policy. As it was to France that Italy owed her emancipation from Austrian rule, it
                                seemed natural that the two countries should remain allies, but anything like cordial co-operation was prevented by conflicting
                                interests and hostile feeling. The French did not consider the acquisition of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nice">Nice</name> a sufficient compensation for the assistance they had given to the cause of Italian unity, and they did not
                                know, or did not care to remember, that their own government was greatly to blame for the passive attitude of Italy in the hour
                                of their great national misfortunes. On the other hand, a considerable amount of bitterness against France had been gradually
                                accumulating in the hearts of the Italians. As far back as the end of the war of 1859, popular opinion had been freely expressed
                                against <ref>
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon III.</name>, because he had
                                    failed to keep his promise of liberating Italy <quote>" from the Alps to the Adriatic."</quote>
                                </ref> The feeling was
                                revived and intensified when it became known that he was opposing the annexation of central and southern Italy, and that he
                                obtained <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savoy">Savoy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nice">Nice</name> as the price of partly withdrawing his opposition. Subsequently, in the
                                war of 1866, he was supposed to have insulted Italy by making her conclude peace with Austria, on the basis of the cession of
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venetia_(region)">Venetia</name>, before she could wipe out the

Then came the French protection of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Pius_IX">the pope</name>'s temporal power as a constant source of
                                irritation, producing occasional explosions of violent hostility, as when the new <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antoine_Alphonse_Chassepot">Chassepot</name> rifles were announced to have <q>" worked

                                    <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Republic</name>, the relations did not
                                improve. French statesmen of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adolphe_Thiers">Thiers</name> school had
                                always condemned the imperial policy of permitting and even encouraging the creation of large, powerful states on the French
                                frontiers, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adolphe_Thiers">Thiers</name> himself publicly attributed to
                                this policy the misfortunes of his country. With regard to Italy, he said openly that he regretted what had been done, though he
                                had no intention of undoing it. The first part of this statement was carefully noted in Italy, and the latter part was accepted
                                with scepticism. In any case his hand might perhaps be forced, for in the first <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chamber_of_Deputies_of_France">republican chamber</name> the monarchical and clerical
                                element was very strong, and it persistently attempted to get something done in favour of the temporal power. Even when the
                                party of the Left undertook the direction of affairs in 1876, the government did not become anti-clerical in its foreign policy,
                                and Italian statesmen resigned themselves to a position of political isolation. The position had its advantages. Events in the
                                Balkan Peninsula foreshadowed a great European war, and it seemed that in the event of Europe's being divided into two hostile
                                camps, Italy might have the honour and the advantage of regulating the balance of power. By maintaining good relations with all
                                her neighbours and carefully avoiding all inconvenient entanglements, she might come forward at the critical moment and dictate
                                her own terms to either of the contending parties, or offer her services to the highest bidder. This Machiavellian policy did
                                not give the expected results. Being friends with everybody in a general way may be the best course for an old, conservative
                                country which desires merely the maintenance of the <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                    <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi>
                                </foreign>, but it
                                does not secure the energetic diplomatic support required by a young enterprising state which wishes to increase its territory
                                and influence. At the congress of Berlin, when several of the powers got territorial acquisitions, Italy got nothing. The
                                Italians, who were in the habit of assuming, almost as a matter of principle, that from all European complications they had a
                                right to obtain some tangible advantage, were naturally disappointed, and they attributed their misfortune to their political
                                isolation. The policy of the free hand consequently fell into disrepute, and the desire for a close, efficient alliance revived.
                                But with what power or powers should an alliance be made ? The remnants of the old party of action, who still carried the
                                    <foreign xml:lang="it"/> banner, had an answer ready. They recommended that alliances should be concluded with a view to
                                wresting from Austria <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Province_of_Trento">the Trentino</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trieste">Trieste</name>, with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dalmatia">Dalmatia</name>, perhaps, into the bargain. On the other hand, the Conservatives
                                and the Moderates considered that the question of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Province_of_Trento">the

                                that of political influence in the Mediterranean. A strong Austria was required, it was said, to bar the way of Russia to the
                                Adriatic, and France must not be allowed to pursue unchecked her policy of transforming the Mediterranean into a French lake.
                                Considerations of this kind led naturally to the conclusion that Italy should draw closer to the powers of central Europe. So

                                kept strictly secret, the Italian government soon got wind of the affair, and it was at first much alarmed. It considered, in
                                common with Italians generally, that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tunisia">Tunis</name>, on the ground of
                                historic right and of national interests, should be reserved for Italy, and that an extension of French territory in that
                                direction would destroy, to the detriment of Italy, the balance of power in the Mediterranean. These apprehensions were calmed
                                for a time by assurances given to the Italian ambassador in Paris. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Léon_Gambetta">M.

                                irreconcilable enemy of France. Whilst the French were giving free expression to their patriotic exultation, and even <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Léon_Gambetta">M. Gambetta</name> himself, in defiance of what he had said to

                                the nations, the Italians were trying to smother their indignation and to discover some means of retrieving what they had lost.
                                The only remedy seemed to be to secure foreign alliances, and there was now no hesitation as to where they should be sought.
                                Simple people in Italy imagined that if an alliance had been concluded sooner with Germany and Austria, these powers would have
                                prevented France from trampling on the sacred interests of Italy. This idea was entirely erroneous, because Austria had little
                                or no interest in the Tunisian Question, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> was not at all sorry to see France embark on an enterprise which distracted her attention from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alsace">Alsace</name>- <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lotharingia">Lorraine</name> and removed all danger of a Franco-Italian alliance. The
                                illusion, however, had a powerful influence on Italian public opinion. The government was now urged to conclude without further
                                delay an alliance with the central powers, and the recommendation was not unwelcome to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umberto_I_of_Italy">the king</name>, because most of the Italian Gallophils had
                                anti-dynastic and republican tendencies, and he was naturally disposed to draw nearer to governments which proclaimed themselves
                                the defenders of monarchical institutions and the opponents of revolutionary agitation. After protracted negotiations, in which
                                Italy tried in vain to secure protection for her own separate interests in the Mediterranean, defensive <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">treaties of alliance</title> were concluded with the cabinets of
                                Vienna and Berlin in May 1882. Though the Italian statesmen did not secure by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">these treaties</title> all they wanted, they felt that <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_Italy_(1861–1946)">the kingdom</name> was protected against

                                the evil results of the congress of Berlin might be counteracted by a formal agreement between the three emperors. The

                                disquieted by the continuance of the Nihilist agitation, and was not averse from drawing closer to the conservative powers; and
                                as he desired tranquillity for some time in the Balkan Peninsula, he was glad to have security that his rival would do nothing
                                in that part of the world without a previous understanding. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_de_Giers">M. de Giers</name>, who had now succeeded <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gorchakov">Prince Gorchakov</name> in the direction of foreign affairs, was

                                subject with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>. The practical result of
                                the meeting was that negotiations between the two governments were begun, and on the 21st of March 1884 a formal document was
                                signed in Berlin. About six months later, in the month of September, the three emperors met at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skierniewice">Skiernevice</name> and ratified the agreement. Thus, without any modification

                                to paralyse Russia by yoking her to Germany and Austria, to isolate France, and to realize his old scheme of holding the balance
                                between Russia and Austria in the Balkan Peninsula. With a view to attaining the first two objects it was stipulated that if any
                                one of the three powers were forced to make war on a fourth power, the two other contracting parties should observe a benevolent
                                neutrality towards their ally. If we may believe a well-informed Russian authority, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> wished it to be understood that in the event of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of the powers being at war with a fourth, the stipulation about benevolent neutrality should still

                                the ground that he could not remain a passive spectator of a duel in which France would be confronted by two antagonists. In his
                                third object <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> was successful, for it was
                                expressly laid down that in all cases of a disagreement between two of the parties in the affairs of the Balkan Peninsula, the
                                third power should decide between them. This meant, of course, that in all discussions between Russia and Austria, the two great
                                rivals in the Eastern Question, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> should
                                always have a casting vote. In return for all this, Russia obtained two small concessions: firstly, that Germany and Austria
                                should seek to restrain <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name> from permitting
                                the passage of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dardanelles">the Dardanelles</name> to an English fleet, as
                                he had done in 1878, when the Russian army was before Constantinople ; and, secondly, that they should not oppose the union of
                                Bulgaria and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Rumelia">Eastern Rumelia</name>, if it was accomplished

                                    League</name> had all the organic defects of its predecessor, and was destined to be still more shortlived. The claims of
                                Russia and Austria might be reconcilable in theory, but in practice they were sure to conflict; and however much <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> might try to play the part of an honest
                                broker, he was certain to be suspected of opposing Russia and favouring Austria. It was therefore only during a period of
                                political stagnation in south-eastern Europe that the arrangement could work smoothly. The political stagnation did not last
                                long. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince Alexander of Bulgaria</name>
                                had for some time been fretting under the high-handed interference of the Russian agents in the principality, and had begun to
                                oppose systematically what the Russians considered their legitimate influence. Relations between Sofia and St Petersburg had
                                consequently become strained, when a crisis was suddenly brought about by the revolution of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plovdiv">Philippopolis</name> in September 1885. The conspirators arrested and expelled
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gavril_Krastevich">the governor-general</name>, who had been appointed

                                revolution had been effected with the connivance and approval of the regularly accredited Russian agents in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plovdiv">Philippopolis</name>, but it had not received the sanction of the Russian
                                government, and was resented as a new act of insubordination on the part of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince Alexander</name>. When he arrived in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plovdiv">Philippopolis</name> and accepted the declaration of union, the
                                cabinet of St Petersburg protested against any such infraction of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)">the Berlin treaty</title>, and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> prepared to send an army into the province. It was
                                restrained from taking this step by the ambassadors in Constantinople, so that an armed conflict between Turks and Bulgarians
                                was prevented; but no sooner had the Bulgarians been relieved from this danger on their eastern frontier, than they were
                                attacked from the west by the Servians, who were determined to get ample compensation for any advantage which the Bulgarians
                                might obtain. The Bulgarian army defeated the Servians at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slivnitsa">Slivnitza</name> (November 19-20, 1885), and was marching on Belgrade when its advance was stopped and an armistice
                                arranged by the energetic intervention of the Austrian government. Following the example of the Servians, the Greeks were
                                preparing <pb n="948" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0948.png"/> to exact territorial compensation likewise ; but as their mobilization was a slow process, the powers
                                had time to restrain them from entering on active hostilities, first by an ultimatum (April 26, 1886), and afterwards by a
                                blockade of their ports (May 1886). By that time, thanks to the intervention of the powers, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treaty_of_Bucharest_(1886)">a peace</title> between Bulgaria and Servia had been signed at
                                Bucharest (March 3); and with regard to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eastern_Rumelia">Eastern
                                    Rumelia</name> a compromise had been effected by which the formal union with the principality was rejected, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">the prince</name> was appointed
                                governor-general of the province for a term of five years. This was in reality union in disguise.</p>
                            <p>The diplomatic solution of the problem averted the danger of a European war, but it left a great deal of dissatisfaction, which
                                soon produced new troubles. Not only had <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince Alexander</name> escaped punishment for his insubordination to Russia, but he and the anti-Russian party among the
                                Bulgarians had obtained a decided success. This could not well be tolerated. Before six months had passed (August 21, 1886)
                                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">Prince Alexander</name> was kidnapped by
                                conspirators in his palace at Sofia and conveyed secretly to Russian <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bessarabia">Bessarabia</name>. As soon as the incident was reported to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander,_Prince_of_Bulgaria">the prince</name> was released, and he at once returned to
                                Sofia, where a counter-revolution had been effected in his favour; but he considered his position untenable, and formally
                                abdicated. A fortnight after his departure <name type="person">General Kaulbars</name> arrived from St Petersburg with
                                instructions from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name> to restore order
                                in accordance with Russian interests. In St Petersburg it was supposed that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">the Bulgarian people</name> were still devoted to Russia, and that they were
                                ready to rise against and expel the politicians of the Nationalist party led by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name>. <name type="person">General Kaulbars</name> accordingly
                                made a tour in the country and delivered speeches to the assembled multitudes, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name>'s political organization counteracted all his efforts,
                                and on the 20th of November he left Bulgaria and took the Russian consuls with him. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stefan_Stambolov">Stambolof</name> maintained his position, suppressed energetically
                                several insurrectionary movements, and succeeded in getting <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria">Prince Ferdinand of Coburg</name> elected prince (July 7, 1887),
                                in spite of the opposition of Russia, who put forward as candidate a Russian subject, <name type="person">Prince Nicholas of
                                    Mingrelia</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria">Prince Ferdinand</name> was

                                aggression. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> resisted the pressure
                                brought to bear on him from several quarters in favour of the anti-Russian party in Bulgaria, but he was suspected by the
                                Russians of siding with Austria and secretly encouraging the opposition to Russian influence. This revived the hatred against
                                him which had been created by his pro-Austrian leanings after the Russo-Turkish War. The feeling was assiduously fomented by the

                                openly attacked as a partisan of the German alliance, and his <q>" pilgrimages to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrichsruh">Friedrichsruh</name> and Berlin "</q> were compared to the humiliating

                                Berlin such significant facts could not fail to produce uneasiness, because one of the chief aims of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name>'s policy had always been to prevent a Russo-French
                                    <foreign xml:lang="fr">
                                    <hi rend="italic">entente cordiale</hi>
                                </foreign>. The German press were instructed to refute the
                                arguments of their Russian colleagues, and to prove that if Russia had really lost her influence in the Balkan Peninsula, the
                                fact was due to the blunders of her own diplomacy. The controversy did not produce at once a serious estrangement between the
                                two cabinets, but it marked the beginning of a period of vacillation on the part of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name> When the treaty of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skierniewice">Skiernevice</name> was about to expire in 1887, he positively refused to
                                renew <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the Three Emperors' League</name>,
                                but he consented to make, without the cognizance of Austria, a secret treaty of alliance with Germany for three years. Not
                                satisfied with this guarantee against the danger of a Franco-Russian alliance, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> caused attacks to be made in the press on Russian
                                credit, which was rapidly gaining a footing on the Paris bourse, and he imprudently showed his hand by prohibiting <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reichsbank">the Reichsbank</name> from accepting Russian securities as
                                guarantees. From that moment <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s
                                attitude changed. All his dormant suspicions of German policy revived. When he passed through Berlin in November 1887, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had a long audience, in which he defended
                                himself with his customary ability, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander</name> remained unmoved in his conviction that the German government had systematically opposed Russian
                                interests, and had paralysed Russian action in the Balkan Peninsula for the benefit of Austria ; and he failed to understand the
                                ingenious theory put forward by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">the German
                                    chancellor</name>, that two powers might have a severe economic struggle without affecting their political relations. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had to recognize that, for the moment at
                                least, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/League_of_the_Three_Emperors">the Three Emperors'
                                League</name>, which had served his purposes so well, could not be resuscitated, but he had still a certain security against the
                                hostility of Russia in the secret treaty. Soon, however, this link was also to be broken. When the treaty expired in 1890 it was
                                not renewed. By that time <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_von_Bismarck">Bismarck</name> had been
                                dismissed, and he subsequently reproached his successor, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_von_Caprivi">Count Caprivi</name>, with not having renewed it, but in reality <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_von_Caprivi">Count Caprivi</name> was not to blame. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">Alexander III.</name> was determined not to renew the alliance,
                                and was already gravitating slowly towards an understanding with France.</p>

                                in the event of a great war the two nations would be found fighting on the same side, and the military authorities in both
                                countries felt that if no arrangements were made beforehand for concerted action,— such arrangements having been long ago
                                completed by the powers composing <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">the Triple
                                    Alliance</name>,— they would begin the campaign at a great disadvantage. This was perfectly understood by both governments;
                                and after some hesitation on both sides, Generals <name type="person">Vannovski</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolai_Obruchev">Obruchev</name>, on the one side, and Generals <name type="person">Saussier</name>, <name type="person">Miribel</name> and <name type="person">Boisdeffre</name> on the other, were permitted
                                to discuss plans of co-operation. At the same time a large quantity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Lebel">Lebel</name> rifles were manufactured in France for the Russian army, and
                                the secret of making smokeless powder was communicated to the Russian military authorities. The French government wished to go
                                further and conclude a defensive alliance, but <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the
                                    tsar</name> was reluctant to bind himself with a government which had so little stability, and which might be induced to
                                provoke a war with Germany by the prospect of Russian support. Even the military convention was not formally ratified until
                                1894. The enthusiastic partisans of the alliance flattered themselves that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_III_of_Russia">the tsar</name>'s reluctance had been overcome, when he received
                                very graciously <name type="person">Admiral Gervais</name> and his officers during the visit of the French fleet to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kronstadt">Cronstadt</name> in the summer of 1891, but their joy was
                                premature. The formal <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                    <name type="person">the admiral</name> and his subordinates received in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toulon">Toulon</name> and Paris (October 1893) showed how eager and anxious <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">the French people</name> were for an alliance with Russia, but
                                the Russian government was in no hurry to gratify their wishes. Of the official action all we know with certainty is, that

                                that close friendly relations were established between the two powers, and that in all important international affairs they
                                sought to act in accord with each other. It is equally certain that for some years Russia was the predominant partner, and that,

                                was not radically changed till the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5. By that war the balance of power in Europe was seriously
                                disturbed. Russia inadvertently provoked a struggle with Japan which made such a drain on her energies and material resources
                                that her political influence in Europe necessarily suffered a partial eclipse. Thus <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triple_Alliance_(1882)">the Triple Alliance</name> outweighed its rival, and there was a
                                danger of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor">the German emperor</name>'s taking
                                advantage of the situation to secure for himself a diplomatic predominance in Europe. France at once perceived that there was a
                                grave danger for herself, and naturally looked about for some diplomatic support to replace that of Russia, which had lost much
                                of its value. From her uncomfortable isolation there were only two possible exits—a <foreign xml:lang="fr">

                                with England. Both of these demanded sacrifices. The former required a formal abandonment of all ideas of recovering <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alsace">Alsace</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lotharingia">Lorraine</name> ; the latter a formal recognition of British predominance in

                                French government chose what seemed the lesser of two evils, and concluded with the English foreign office in April 1904 a

For some fifteen years <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenians">the Armenians</name> continued to hope for the efficacious intervention of their
                                protectors, but when their patience became exhausted and the question seemed in danger of being forgotten, they determined to
                                bring it again to the front. Some of them confined themselves to agitating abroad, especially in England, in favour of the
                                cause, whilst others made preparations for exciting an insurrectionary movement in Constantinople and Asia Minor. These latter
                                knew very well that an insurrection could be suppressed by the Turkish government without much difficulty, but they hoped that
                                the savage measures of repression which the Turks were sure to employ might lead to the active intervention of Europe and ensure
                                their liberation from Turkish rule, as the famous <q>"atrocities"</q> of 1876 had led to the political emancipation of Bulgaria.
                                In due course—1895-1896—the expected atrocities took place, in the form of wholesale massacres in Constantinople and various
                                towns of Asia Minor. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">The sultan</name> was subjected to
                                diplomatic pressure and threatened with more efficient means of coercion. In the diplomatic campaign England took the lead, and
                                was warmly supported by Italy, but Germany, Austria and France showed themselves lukewarm, not to say indifferent, and Russia,
                                departing from her traditional policy of protecting the Christians of Turkey, vetoed the employment of force for extracting
                                concessions from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name>. In these circumstances

                                making a few reforms on paper, which were never carried out. Thus the last state of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenians">the Armenians</name> was worse than the first, but the so-called European
                                concert was maintained, and the danger of a great European war was averted.</p>

                                    kingdom</name>, and a contingent of Greek regular troops landed near <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chania">Canea</name> under the command of <name type="person">Colonel Vassos</name> to take
                                possession of the island in the name of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_I_of_Greece">King
                                    George</name>. The powers, objecting to this arbitrary proceeding, immediately occupied <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chania">Canea</name> with a mixed force from the ships of war which were there at the time,
                                and summoned the Greek government to withdraw its troops. The summons was disregarded, and the whole of the Greek army was
                                mobilized on the frontier of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thessaly">Thessaly</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epirus_(region)">Epirus</name>. In consequence of a raid into Turkish
                                territory <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Porte</name> declared war on the 17th of
                                April, and the short campaign ended in the defeat of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the
                                    Greeks</name>. The powers intervened to put an end to the hostilities, and after prolonged negotiations a peace was
                                concluded by which Greece had to consent to a strategical rectification of frontier and to pay a war indemnity of £4,000,000.
                                Thus a second time the European concert acted effectually in the interests of peace, but it did not stand the strain of the
                                subsequent efforts to solve the Cretan Question. Finding the Turks less conciliatory after their military success, and being
                                anxious to remain in cordial relations with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the
                                    Porte</name>, Germany withdrew from further co-operation with the powers, and Austria followed her example. They did not,
                                however, offer any active opposition, and the question received a temporary solution by the appointment of <name type="person">Prince George</name>, second son of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_I_of_Greece">the king of
                                    Greece</name>, as high commissioner and governor-general of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">the

                            <p>The conflicting desires of several of the powers to obtain colonial possessions in various parts of the world, and to forestall
                                their competitors in the act of taking possession, were bound to introduce complications in which England, as the greatest <pb n="950" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0950.png"/> of colonial powers, would generally be involved ; and as the unappropriated portions of the earth's surface at the
                                beginning of the period under discussion were to be found chiefly in Africa, it was in the Dark Continent that the conflicts of
                                interests mostly took place. England's chief competitors were France and Germany. Her traditional policy, except in the south of
                                the continent, where the conditions of soil and climate were favourable to European colonists, had been purely commercial. She
                                had refrained from annexation of territory, as involving too much expenditure and responsibility, and confined her protection to
                                the trading stations on the coast. When France came into the field this policy had to be abandoned. The policy of France was
                                also commercial in a certain sense, but the methods she adopted were very different. She endeavoured to bring under her
                                authority, by annexation or the establishment of protectorates, the largest possible extent of territory, in order to increase
                                her trade by a system of differential tariffs ; she encroached on the hinterland of British settlements, and endeavoured to
                                direct artificially the native inland trade towards her own ports. A glance at the map of the African West Coast will suffice to
                                show the success with which this policy was carried out. When the British government awoke to the danger, all that could be done
                                was to prevent further encroachments by likewise annexing territory. The result is shown in the article AFRICA : § 5. In her
                                dealings with France about the partition of Africa, England was generally conciliatory, but she was always inflexible in
                                guarding carefully the two entrances to the Mediterranean. There was, therefore, a permanent danger of conflict in Egypt and
                                Morocco. When England in 1882 considered it necessary to suppress the Arabi insurrection, she invited France to co-operate, but
                                the French government declined, and left the work to be done by England alone. England had no intention of occupying the country
                                permanently, but she had to take precautions against the danger of French occupation after her withdrawal, and these precautions
                                were embodied in an Anglo-Turkish convention signed at Constantinople in May 1887. France prevented the ratification of the
                                convention by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">the sultan</name>, with the result that the
                                British occupation has been indefinitely prolonged. She still clung persistently, however, to the hope of obtaining a
                                predominant position in the valley of the Nile, and she tried to effect her purpose by gaining a firm foothold on the upper
                                course of the river. The effort which she made in 1898 to attain this end, by simultaneously despatching the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Marchand">Marchand</name> mission from her <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Congo">Congo</name> possessions and inciting <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menelik_II_of_Ethiopia">the emperor Menelek of Abyssinia</name> to send a force from the
                                east to join hands with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Marchand">Major Marchand</name> at
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kodok">Fashoda</name>, was defeated by the overthrow of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdallahi_ibn_Muhammad">the Khalifa</name> and the British occupation of
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khartoum">Khartum</name>. For a few days the two nations seemed on the
                                brink of war, but the French government, receiving no encouragement from St Petersburg, consented to withdraw the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Marchand">Marchand</name> mission, and a convention was signed
                                defining the respective spheres of influence of the two countries.</p>
                            <p>In Morocco the rivalry between the two powers was less acute but not less persistent and troublesome. France aspired to
                                incorporate the sultanate with her north African possessions, whilst England had commercial interests to defend and was firmly
                                resolved to prevent France from getting unfettered possession of the southern coast of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strait_of_Gibraltar">the Straits of Gibraltar</name>. As in Egypt, so in Morocco the
                                dangers of conflict were averted, in 1904, by a general agreement, which enabled France to carry out in Morocco, as far as
                                England was concerned, her policy of pacific penetration, but debarred her from erecting fortifications in the vicinity of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strait_of_Gibraltar">the straits</name>. Germany thereafter strongly opposed
                                French claims in Morocco, but after a period of great tension, and the holding of an ineffectual conference at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeciras">Algeciras</name> in 1906, an understanding was come to in 1909 (see
                                MOROCCO : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>).</p>
                            <p>With Germany likewise, from 1880 onwards, England had some diplomatic difficulties regarding the partition of Africa, but they
                                never reached a very acute phase, and were ultimately settled by mutual concessions. By <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heligoland-Zanzibar_Treaty">the arrangement</title> of 1890, in which several of the
                                outstanding questions were solved, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heligoland">Heligoland</name> ceded to
                                Germany in return for concessions in East Africa. A conflict of interests in the southern Pacific was amicably arranged by the
                                Anglo-German convention of April 1886, in which a line of demarcation was drawn between the respective spheres of influence in
                                the islands to the north and east of the Australian continent, and by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tripartite_Convention_(1899)">the convention of 1899</title>, in virtue of which Germany
                                gained possession of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Samoa">Samoa</name> and renounced in favour of

                            <p>In Asia the tendencies of the European powers to territorial expansion, and their desire to secure new markets for their trade
                                and industry, have affected from time to time their mutual relations. More than once England and Russia have had disputes about
                                the limits of their respective spheres of influence in central Asia, but the causes of friction have steadily diminished as the
                                work of frontier delimitation has advanced. The important agreement of 1872-1873 was supplemented by the protocol of the 22nd of
                                July 1887 and <title>the Pamir delimitation of 1895</title>, so that the Russo-Afghan frontier, which is the dividing line
                                between the Russian and British spheres of influence, has now been carried right up to the frontier of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Late_Imperial_China">the Chinese empire</name>. The delimitation of the English and French
                                spheres of influence in Asia has also progressed. In 1885 France endeavoured to get a footing on <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ayeyarwady_River">the Upper Irrawaddy</name>, the hinterland of British Burma, and England
                                replied in the following year by annexing the dominions of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thibaw_Min">King
                                    Thebaw</name>, including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shan_States">the Shan States</name> as far east
                                as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mekong">the Mekong</name>. Thereupon France pushed her Indo-Chinese
                                frontier westwards, and in 1893 made an attack on <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thailand">the
                                    kingdom of Siam</name>, which very nearly brought about a conflict with England. After prolonged negotiations an arrangement
                                was reached and embodied in a formal treaty (January 1896), which clearly foreshadows a future partition between the two powers,
                                but guarantees the independence of the central portion of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thailand">the kingdom</name>, the Valley of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chao_Phraya_River">the Menam</name>,
                                as a buffer-state. Farther north, in eastern China, the aggressive tendencies and mutual rivalries of the European powers have
                                produced a problem of a much more complicated kind. Firstly Germany, then Russia, next England, and finally France took portions
                                of Chinese territory, under the thin disguise of long leases. They thereby excited in the Chinese population and government an
                                intense anti-foreign feeling, which produced the Boxer movement and culminated in the attack on the foreign legations at Pekin
                                in the summer of 1900. (See CHINA : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>.)</p>
                            <p>In 1890-1901 the relations of the European powers were disturbed by the Boer War in South Africa. In nearly every country of
                                Europe popular feeling was much excited against England, and in certain influential quarters the idea was entertained of
                                utilizing this feeling for the formation of a coalition against <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Empire">the British empire</name> ; but in view of the decided attitude assumed by
                                the British government, and the loyal enthusiasm displayed by the colonies, no foreign government ventured to take the
                                initiative of intervention, and it came gradually to be recognized that no European state had any tangible interest in
                                prolonging the independence and maladministration of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boer_Republics">the Boer republics</name>.</p>
                            <p>One permanent factor in the history of Europe after the war of 1870-71 was the constant increase of armaments by all the great
                                powers, and the proportionate increase of taxation. The fact made such an impression on the young emperor of Russia, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicholas_II_of_Russia">Nicholas II.</name>, that he invited the powers to
                                consider whether the further increase of the burdens thereby imposed on the nations might not be arrested by mutual agreement;
                                and a conference for this purpose was convened at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Hague">the
                                    Hague</name> (May 18- July 29, 1899), but the desirable object in view was not attained. (See ARBITRATION,

                                which met in 1907, did much to fulfil the expectations of those who hoped for the establishment of a system which should
                                guarantee the world against the disasters of war, they undoubtedly tended to create a strong public opinion in favour of
                                peaceful methods in the solution of international problems which has not been without its effect. Any attempt to organize the
                                concert of the powers must always <pb n="951" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.09.0951.png"/> fail, as it failed in the early part of the 19th century, so long as the spirit
                                of national and racial rivalry is stronger than the consciousness of common interests ; and the early years of the 20th century
                                showed no diminution, but rather an accentuation of this rivalry. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration">The court of arbitration</name> established at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Hague">the Hague</name> early in 1901 may deal effectively with questions

                                much to prevent misunderstandings likely to lead to war, resulted from 1903 onwards in a series of arbitration treaties between
                                Great Britain and other powers which guaranteed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permanent_Court_of_Arbitration">the Hague court</name> an effective activity in such
                                matters. But more perilous issues, involving deep-seated antagonisms, have continued to be dealt with by the methods of the old
                                diplomacy backed by the armed force of the powers. How far the final solution of such problems has been helped or hindered by
                                the general reluctance to draw the sword must for some time to come remain an open question. Certainly, during the early years
                                of the 20th century, many causes of difference which a hundred years earlier would assuredly have led to war, were settled, or

                                interest which might have led to war, but which found a peaceful solution, were those of the separation of Norway and Sweden,
                                and the rivalry of the powers in the northern seas. In October 1905 Sweden formally recognized the separate existence of Norway
                                (see NORWAY : <hi rend="italic">History</hi> and SWEDEN : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). On the 23rd of April 1908 were signed

                                the North Sea. These were followed, in June of the same year, by two agreements intended to apply the same principles to the
                                southern European waters, signed by France and Spain and Great Britain and Spain respectively. Another agreement, that signed
                                between Russia and Great Britain in 1907 for the delimitation of their spheres of influence in Persia and the northern borders
                                of the Indian empire, though having no direct relation to European affairs, exercised considerable influence upon them by

                                or later to open up the whole Eastern Question once more in its acutest form. The situation was due to the internecine struggle
                                of the rival Balkan races— <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">Greek</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">Bulgarian</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbs">Servian</name>—to secure the right to the reversion of territories not yet derelict. But behind these lesser issues loomed
                                the great secular rivalries of the powers, and beyond these again the vast unknown forces of the Mahommedan world, ominously
                                stirring. The very vastness of the perils involved in any attempt at a definitive settlement compelled the powers to accept a

                                of equally hideous, if less wholesale, reprisals by Bulgarian bands, grew rather than diminished, and reached its climax in the

                                crippled by the passive obstruction of the Turkish government. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdul_Hamid_II">The sultan</name>, indeed, could hardly be blamed for watching with a

                            <p>Such was the condition of affairs when in October 1908 the revolution in Turkey altered the whole situation. The easy and

                                been in abeyance since 1876, took the whole world by surprise, and not least those who believed themselves to be most intimately
                                acquainted with the conditions prevailing in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the
                                    Ottoman empire</name>. The question of the Near East seemed in fair way of settlement by the action of conflicting races
                                themselves, who in the enthusiasm of newfound freedom appeared ready to forget their ancient internecine feuds and to fraternize
                                on the common ground of constitutional liberty (see TURKEY : <hi rend="italic">History</hi>). By the European powers the
                                proclamation of the constitution was received, at least outwardly, with unanimous approval, general admiration being expressed
                                for the singular moderation and self-restraint shown by the Turkish leaders and people. Whatever views, however, may have been
                                openly expressed, or secretly held, as to the revolution so far as it affected <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman empire</name> itself, there could be no doubt that its effects
                                on the general situation in Europe would be profound. These effects were not slow in revealing themselves. On the 5th of October

                                situation was justified by the event. For months, indeed, Europe seemed on the verge of a general war. During the autumn the
                                nationalist excitement in Servia and Montenegro rose to feverheat, and Austria responded by mobilizing her forces on the
                                frontiers and arming the Catholic <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bosnians">Bosnians</name> as a precaution
                                against a rising of their Orthodox countrymen. Only the winter seemed to stand between Europe and a war bound to become general,
                                and men looked forward with apprehension to the melting of the snows. It is too early as yet to write the history of the

                                at an expense greater than that on which he had calculated. At this point Germany, conscious throughout of holding the key to
                                the situation, intervened with effect. Towards the end of March 1909 the German ambassador at St Petersburg, armed with an

                                forces which had been mobilized on the Polish frontier. In any case, the result was immediate and startling. Russia, without
                                previous discussion with her allies, dissociated herself from the views she had hitherto held in common with them, and accepted

                                could do was to persuade her to make the best of a bad bargain. The Ottoman government, preoccupied with the internal questions

                                Great Britain, especially, public opinion was quick to grasp this truth. It was realized that it was the immense armed power of

                            <gloss target="#HISTORY" rend="unmarked">The word " history " is used in two senses. It may mean either the record of events, or
                                events themselves.</gloss> Originally (see below) limited to inquiry and statement, it was only in comparatively modern times
                            that the meaning of the word was extended to include the phenomena which form or might form their subject. It was perhaps by a
                            somewhat careless transference of ideas that this extension was brought about. Now indeed it is the commoner meaning. We speak of
                            the <q>" history of England "</q> without reference to any literary narrative. We term kings and statesmen the <q>" makers of
                                history,"</q> and sometimes say that the historian only records the history which they make. History in this connexion is
                            obviously not the record, but the thing to be recorded. It is unfortunate that such a double meaning of the word should have grown
                            up, for it is productive of not a little confusion of thought.</p>
                        <p>History in the wider sense is all that has happened, not merely all the phenomena of human life, but those of the natural world as
                            well. It includes everything that undergoes change ; and as modern science has shown that there is nothing absolutely static
                            therefore the whole universe, and every part of it, has its history. The discovery of ether brought with it a reconstruction of our
                            ideas of the physical universe, transferring the emphasis from the mathematical expression of static relationships to a dynamic
                            conception of a universe in constant transformation ; matter in equipoise became energy in gradual readjustment. Solids are solids
                            no longer. The universe is in motion in every particle of every part; rock and metal merely a transition stage between
                            crystallization and dissolution. This idea of universal activity has in a sense made physics itself a branch of history. It is the
                            same with the other sciences—especially the biological division, where the doctrine of evolution has induced an attitude of mind
                            which is distinctly historical.</p>
                        <p>But the tendency to look at things historically is not merely the attitude of men of science. Our outlook upon life differs in just
                            this particular from that of preceding ages. We recognize the unstable nature of our whole social fabric, and are therefore more and
                            more capable of transforming it. Our institutions are no longer held to be inevitable and immutable creations. We do not attempt to
                            fit them to absolute formulae, but continually adapt them to a changing environment. Even modern architecture, notably in America,
                            reflects the consciousness of change. The permanent character of ancient or medieval buildings was fitted only to a society
                            dominated by static ideals. Now the architect builds, not for all time, but for a set of conditions which will inevitably cease in
                            the not distant future. Thus our whole society not only bears the marks of its evolution, but shows its growing consciousness of the
                            fact in the most evident of its arts. In literature, philosophy and political science, there is the same historical trend. Criticism
                            no longer judges by absolute standards ; it applies the standards of the author's own environment. We no longer condemn <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare">Shakespeare</name> for having violated the ancient dramatic
                            laws, nor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire">Voltaire</name> for having objected to the violations. Each
                            age has its own expression, and in judging each we enter the field of history. In ethics, again, the revolt against absolute
                            standards limits us to the relative, and morals are investigated on the basis of history, as largely conditioned by economic
                            environment and the growth of intellectual freedom. Revelation no longer appeals to scientific minds as a source of knowledge.
                            Experience on the other hand is history. As for political science, we do not regard the national state as that ultimate and final
                            product which men once saw in the Roman empire. It has hardly come into being before forces are evident which aim at its
                            destruction. Internationalism has gained ground in Europe in recent years ; and Socialism itself, which is based upon a distinct
                            interpretation of history, is regarded by its followers as merely a stage in human progress, like those which have gone before it.
                            It is evident that <ref>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Augustus_Freeman">Freeman</name>'s definition of
                                history as <quote>" past politics "</quote>
                            </ref> is miserably inadequate. Political events are mere externals. History enters
                            into every phase of activity, and the economic forces which urge society along are as much its subject as the political result.</p>
                        <p>In short the historical spirit of the age has invaded every field. The world-picture presented in this encyclopaedia is that of a
                            dynamic universe, of phenomena in process of ceaseless change. Owing to this insistent change all things which happen, or seem to
                            happen, are history in the broader sense of the word. The encyclopaedia itself is a history of them in the stricter sense,— the
                            description and record of this universal process. This narrower meaning is the subject of the rest of this article.</p>
                        <p>The word <q>" history "</q> comes from the Gr. <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">ίστορία</hi>
                            </foreign>, which was used by
                            the Ionians in the 6th century B.C. for the search for knowledge in the widest sense. It meant inquiry, investigation, not
                            narrative. It was not until two centuries later that the <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">historikos</hi>
                            </foreign>, the
                            reciter of stories, superseded the <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">historeōn</hi>
                            </foreign>
                            <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">(ίστορέων)</hi>
                            </foreign>, the seeker after knowledge. Thus history began as a branch of scientific
                            research,—much the same as what the Athenians later termed philosophy. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> himself was as much a scientific explorer as a reciter of
                            narrative, and his life-long investigation was <foreign xml:lang="grc">
                                <hi rend="italic">historiē</hi>
                            </foreign> in his Ionian
                            speech. Yet it was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> himself who first hinted at the
                            new use of the word, applied merely to the details accumulated during a long search for knowledge. It is not until <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, however, that we have it definitely applied to the
                            literary product instead of the inquiry which precedes it. From <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> to modern times, history (Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la">
                                <hi rend="italic">historia</hi>
                            </foreign>) has been a
                            form of literature. It is only in the scientific environment of to-day that we recognize once more, with those earliest of the
                            forerunners of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, that history involves two distinct
                            operations, one of which, investigation, is in the field of science, while the other, the literary presentation, is in the field of
                            art.</p>
                        <p>The history of history itself is therefore two-fold. History as art flourishes with the arts. It calls upon the imagination and the
                            literary gifts of expression. Its history does not run parallel with the scientific side, but rather varies in inverse ratio with
                            scientific activity. Those periods which have been dominated by the great masters of style have been less interested in the
                            criticism of the historian's methods of investigation than in the beauty of his rhetoric. The scientific historian, deeply
                            interested <pb n="528" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.13.0528.png"/> in the search for truth, is generally but a poor artist, and his uncoloured picture of the past will never
                            rank in literature beside the splendid distortions which glow in the pages of a <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Michelet">Michelet</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay">Macaulay</name>. History the art, in so far as
                            it is conditioned upon genius, has no single traceable line of development. Here the product of the age of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles">Pericles</name> remains unsurpassed still; the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name> standing along with those of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phidias">Pheidias</name> as models for all time. On the other hand, history the science has
                            developed so that it has not only gained recognition among historians as a distinct subject, but it has raised with it a group of
                            auxiliary sciences which serve either as tools for investigation or as a basis for testing the results. The advance in this branch
                            of history in the 19th century was one of its greatest achievements. The vast gulf which lies between the history of Egypt by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and that by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flinders_Petrie">Flinders Petrie</name> is the measure of its achievement. By the mechanism now
                            at his disposal the scientific explorer can read more history from the dust-heaps of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abydos,_Egypt">Abydos</name> than the greatest traveller of antiquity could gather from the
                            priests of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sais,_Egypt">Saïs</name>. In tracing the history of history we must
                            therefore keep in mind its double aspect.</p>
                        <p>History itself, this double subject, the science and the art combined, begins with the dawn of memory and the invention of speech. It
                            is wrong to term those ages <hi rend="italic">pre-historic</hi> whose history has not come down to us, including in one category the
                            pre-literary age and the literary whose traces have been lost. Even the pre-literary had its history, first in myth and then in
                            saga. The saga, or epos, was a great advance upon the myth, for in it the deeds of men replace or tend to replace the deeds of the
                            gods. But we are still largely in the realm of imagination. Poetry, as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name> complained, is a most imperfect medium for fact. The bard will
                            exaggerate or distort his story. True history, as a record of what really has happened, first reached maturity in prose. Therefore,
                            although much of the past has been handed down to us in epic, in ballad and in the legends of folk-lore, we must turn from them to
                            what became history in the narrower sense.</p>
                        <p>The earliest prose origins of history are the inscriptions. Their inadequacy is evident from two standpoints. Their permanence
                            depends not upon their importance, but upon the durability of the substance on which they are inscribed. A note for a wedding ring
                            baked into the clay of Babylon has been preserved, while the history of the greatest events has perished. In the second place they
                            are sealed to all but those who know how to read them, and so they lie forgotten for centuries while oral tradition
                            flourishes,—being within the reach of every man. It is only recently that archaeology, turning from the field of art, has undertaken
                            to interpret for us this first written history. The process by which the modern fits together all the obtainable remains of an
                            antiquity, and reconstructs even that past which left no written record, lies outside the field of this article. But such
                            enlargement of the field of history is a modern scientific product, and is to be distinguished from the imperfect beginnings of
                            history-writing which the archaeologist is able to decipher.</p>
                        <p>Next to the inscriptions,—sometimes identical with them,— are the early chronicles. These are of various kinds. Family chronicles
                            preserved the memory of heroic ancestors whose deeds in the earliest age would have passed into the keeping of the bards. Such
                            family archives were perhaps the main source for Roman historians. But they are not confined to Rome or Greece. Genealogies also
                            pass from the bald verse, which was the vehicle for oral transmission, to such elaborate tables as those in which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manetho">Manetho</name> has preserved the dynasties of Egyptian Pharaohs.</p>
                        <p>In this field the priest succeeds the poet. The temple itself became the chief repository of records. There were simple religious
                            annals, votive tablets recording miracles accomplished at a shrine, lists of priests and priestesses, accounts of benefactions, of
                            prodigies and portents. In some cases, as in Rome, the pontiffs kept a kind of register, not merely of religious history, but of

                            have been, from his time onward the scientific movement was set going. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodorus">Herodorus of Heraclea</name> struggled to rationalize mythology, and established
                            chronology on a solid basis. And finally <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, a
                            professional story-teller, rose to the height of genuine scientific investigation. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>' inquiry was not simply that of an idle tourist. He was a critical
                            observer, who tested his evidence. It is easy for the student now to show the inadequacy of his sources, and his failure here or
                            there to discriminate between fact and fable. But given the imperfect medium for investigation and the absence of an archaeological
                            basis for criticism, the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> remains a
                            scientific achievement, as remarkable for its approximation to truth as for the vastness of its scope. Yet it was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>' chief glory to have joined to this scientific spirit
                            an artistic sense which enabled him to cast the material into the truest literary form. He gathered all his knowledge of the ancient
                            world, not simply for itself, but to mass it around the story of the war between the east and west, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people">the Persians</name>. He is first and foremost a story-teller ; his theme is
                            like that of the bards, a heroic event. His story is a vast prose epos, in which science is to this extent subordinated to art.

                            It is often only clear in the light of inscriptions, so closely does it keep to the sources. The style found no imitator; history
                            passed from Greece to Rome in the guise of rhetoric. In <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</name> the rhetoric was combined with an
                            extensive study of the sources; but the influence of the Greek rhetoricians upon Roman prose was deplorable from the standpoint of
                            science. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, although he said that the duty of the historian
                            is to conceal nothing true, to say nothing false, would in practice have written the kind of history that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polybius">Polybius</name> denounced. He finds fault with those who are <foreign xml:lang="la">

                            draw argument in oratory and example in education. It is not the subject of a scientific curiosity. It should be noted before we
                            pass to Rome that with the expansion of Hellenism the subject of historians expanded as well. Universal history was begun by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephorus">Ephorus</name>, the rhetorician, and formed the theme of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polybius">Polybius</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diodorus_Siculus">Deodorus</name>. Exiled Greeks were the first to write histories of Rome
                            worthy of the name. The Alexandrian <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</name> placed
                            chronology upon the scientific basis of astronomy, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollodorus">Apollodorus</name> drew up the most important chronica of antiquity.</p>
                        <p>History-writing in Rome,—except for the Greek writers resident there,—was until the first half of the 1st century B.C. in the form of
                            annals. Then came rhetorical ornamentation,—and the Ciceronian era. The first Roman historian who rose to the conception of a
                            science and art combined was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sallust">Sallust</name>, the student of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name>. The Augustan age produced in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livy">Livy</name> a great popular historian and natural artist and a trained rhetorician (in
                            the speeches),—but as uncritical and inaccurate as he was brilliant. From <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livy">Livy</name> to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tacitus">Tacitus</name> the gulf is greater than from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tacitus">Tacitus</name> is at least a consummate artist. His style ranges from the brilliancy of his youth to the sternness and sombre
                            gravity of age, passing almost to poetic expression in its epigrammatic terseness. Yet in spite of his searching study of
                            authorities, his keen judgment of men, and his perception of underlying principles of moral law, his view was warped by the heat of
                            faction, which glows beneath his external objectivity. After him Roman history-writing speedily degenerated. <bibl>

But the world was changing from antique to Christian ideals just as he
                            was writing, and with him we leave this outline of ancient history.</p>
                        <p>The 4th and 5th centuries saw a great revolution in the history of history. The story of the pagan past slipped out of mind, and in
                            its place was set, by the genius of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius_of_Caesarea">Eusebius</name>, the
                            story of the world force which had superseded it, Christianity, and of that small fraction of antiquity from which it sprang,— the
                            Jews. Christianity from the first had forced thinking men to reconstruct their philosophy of history, but it was only after the
                            Church's triumph that its point of view became dominant in historiography. Three centuries more passed before the pagan models were
                            quite lost to sight. But from the 7th century to the 17th—from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isidore_of_Seville">Isidore of Seville</name> and the English <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bede">Bede</name> for a thousand years,—mankind was to look back along the line of Jewish
                            priests and kings to the Creation. Egypt was of interest only as it came into Israelite history, Babylon and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nineveh">Nineveh</name> were to illustrate the judgments of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yahweh">Yahweh</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyre,_Lebanon">Tyre</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sidon">Sidon</name> to reflect the glory of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solomon">Solomon</name>. The process by which the <q>" gentiles "</q> have been
                            robbed of their legitimate history was the inevitable result of a religion whose sacred books make them lay figures for the history
                            of the Jews. Rejected by the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yahweh">Yahweh</name> who became the Christian
                            God, they have remained to the present day, in Sunday schools and in common opinion, not nations of living men, with the culture of
                            arts and sciences, but outcasts who do not enter into the divine scheme of the world's history. When a line was drawn between pagan
                            and Christian back to the creation of the world, it left outside the pale of inquiry nearly all antiquity. But it must be remembered
                            that that antiquity was one in which the German nations had no personal interest. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scipio_(cognomen)">Scipio</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gracchi">the Gracchi</name> were essentially unreal to them. The one living organization with
                            which they came into touch was the Church. So <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pompey">Pompey</name> paled before <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joshua">Joshua</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint_Paul">Paul</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diocletian">Diocletian</name>, the organizing genius, became

                        <p>Christian history begins with the triumph of the Church. With <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eusebius_of_Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</name> the apologetic pamphlets of the age of

                            permitted himself, but the Ecclesiastical History was fortunately written for those who wanted to know what really happened, and
                            remains to-day an invaluable repository of Christian antiquities.

                        <p>From the first, Christianity had a philosophy of history. Its earliest apologists sought to show how the world had followed a divine
                            plan in its long preparation for the life of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus">Christ</name>. From this

                            day. The fate of nations is in God's hands; history is the revelation of His wisdom and power. Whether He intervenes directly by
                            miracle, or merely sets His laws in operation, He is master of men's fate. This idea, which has underlain all Christian philosophy
                            of history, from the first apologists who prophesied the fall of the Empire and the coming of the millennium, down to our own day,

                        <p>The commonest form of medieval historical writing was the chronicle, which reaches all the way from monastic annals, mere notes on
                            Easter tables, to the dignity of national monuments. Utterly lacking in perspective, and dominated by the idea of the miraculous,
                            they are for the most part a record of the trivial or the marvellous. Individual historians sometimes recount the story of their own
                            times with sober judgment, but seldom know how to test their sources when dealing with the past. Contradictions are often copied
                            down without the writer noticing them ; and since <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
                                ages</name> forged and falsified so many documents,— monasteries, towns and corporations gaining privileges or titles of
                            possession by the bold use of them,—the narrative of medieval writers cannot be relied upon unless we can verify it by collateral
                            evidence. Some historians, like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_of_Freising">Otto of Freising</name>,
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guibert_of_Nogent">Guibert of Nogent</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_Gui">Bernard Gui</name>, would have been scientific if they had had our appliances for
                            comparison. But even men like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name>, who deplored the
                            inaccuracy of texts, had worked out no general method to apply in their restoration. Toward the close of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> the vernacular literatures were adorned with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Filippo_Villani">Villani</name>'s and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Froissart">Froissart</name>'s chronicles. But the merit of both lies in their journalistic
                            qualities of contemporary narrative. Neither was a history in the truest sense.</p>

                            sense, in the efforts of the humanists to realize the spirit of the antique world. They did not altogether succeed; antiquity to

Those in which the foundations of modern Europe were laid, which produced parliaments, cathedrals, cities, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer</name>, were grouped alike on one dismal level and christened <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. The perspective of the humanists was only
                            one degree better than that of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. History
                            became the servant to literature, an adjunct to the classics. Thus it passed into the schools, where text-books still in use devote
                            200 pages to the Peloponnesian war and two to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">the Athens</name> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles">Pericles</name>.</p>
                        <p>But if the literary side of humanism has been a barrier to the progress of scientific history, the discovery and elucidation of texts
                            first made that progress possible. Historical criticism soon awoke. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenzo_Valla">Laurentius Valla</name>'s brilliant attack on the <title>" Donation of

                        <p>In the 19th century the science of history underwent a sort of industrial revolution. The machinery of research, invented by the
                            genius of men like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Mabillon">Mabillon</name>, was perfected and set going
                            in all the archives of Europe. Isolated workers or groups of workers grew into national or international associations, producing
                            from archives vast collections of material to be worked up into the artistic form of history. The result of this movement has been
                            to revolutionize the whole subject. These men of the factory— devoting their lives to the cataloguing of archives and libraries, to
                            the publication of material, and then to the gigantic task of indexing what they have produced—have made it possible for the student
                            in an American or Australian college to master in a few hours in his library sources of history which baffled the long years of
                            research of a <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmond_Martène">Martène</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Rymer">Rymer</name>. The texts themselves have mostly become as correct as they can ever

                            supplemented and criticized this work and co-ordinated the results. Every state in Europe now has published the main sources for its

                        <p>Every science which deals with human phenomena is in a way an implement in this great factory system, in which the past is welded
                            together again. Psychology has been drawn upon to interpret the movements of revolutions or religions, anthropology and ethnology
                            furnish a clue to problems to which the key of documents has been lost. Genealogy, heraldry and chronology run parallel with the
                            wider subject. But the real auxiliary sciences to history are those which deal with those traces of the past that still exist, the
                            science of language (philology), of writing (palaeography), of documents (diplomatic), of seals (sphragistics), of coins
                            (numismatics), of weights and measures, and archaeology in the widest sense of the word. These sciences underlie the whole
                            development of scientific history. Dictionaries and manuals are the instruments of this industrial revolution. Without them the
                            literary remains of the race would still be as useless as Egyptian inscriptions to the fellaheen. Archaeology itself remained but a
                            minor branch of art until the machinery was perfected which enabled it to classify and interpret the remains of the <q>"

                        <p>This is the most remarkable chapter in the whole history of history—the recovery of that past which had already been lost when our
                            literary history began. The perspective stretches out as far the other side of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer">Homer</name> as we are this. The old <q>" providential "</q> scheme of history
                            disintegrates before a new interest in the <q>" gentile "</q> nations to whose high culture Hebrew sources bore unwilling testimony.
                            Biblical criticism is a part of the historic process. The Jewish texts, once the infallible basis of history, are now tested by the
                            libraries of Babylon, from which they were partly drawn, and Hebrew history sinks into its proper place in the wide horizon of
                            antiquity. The finding of the Rosetta stone left us no longer dependent upon Greek, Latin or Hebrew sources, and now fifty centuries
                            of Egyptian history lie before us. The scientific historian of antiquity works on the hills of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name>, rather than in the quiet of a library with the classics spread out before
                            him. There he can reconstruct the splendour of that <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minoan_civilization">Minoan

                            checked by contemporary evidence, and a clearer sense of what constitutes a primary source has discredited much of what had been
                            currently accepted as true. This is true not only of ancient history, where last year's book may be a thousand years out of date,
                            but of the whole field. Hardly an <q>"old master"</q> remains an authoritative book of reference. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Gibbon">Gibbon</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Grote">Grote</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Giesebrecht">Giesebrecht</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Guizot">Guizot</name> stand to-day by reason of other virtues than their truth.

                            The result has been a complete transformation of history since the middle of the 19th century.</p>

                            the place of the Providence they rejected. Religion, though false, might be a real historic force. History became the tragic
                            spectacle of a game of dupes—the real movers being priests, kings or warriors. The pawns slowly acquired reason, and then would be
                            able to regulate the moves themselves. But all this failed to give a satisfactory explanation of the laws which determine the
                            direction of this evolution. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giambattista_Vico">Giovanni Battista Vico</name>
                            (1668-1744) was the first to ask why there is no science of human history. But his lonely life and unrecognized labours leave him
                            apart from the main movement, until his works were discovered again in the 19th century. It was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_Hermann_Ludwig_Heeren">A.L.H. Heeren</name> who, at the opening of the 19th century,
                            first laid that emphasis upon the economic factors in history which is to-day slowly replacing the Augustinian explanation of its
                            evolution. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_Hermann_Ludwig_Heeren">Heeren</name>'s own influence,
                            however, was slight. The first half of the century (apart from the scientific activity of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Heinrich_Pertz">Pertz</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Guizot">Guizot</name>, etc.) was largely dominated by the romanticists, with their

                            which lent itself to magnificent dramatic creations ; but it explained nothing. It substituted the work of the genius for the
                            miraculous intervention of Providence, but, apart from certain abstract formulae such as Truth and Right, knew nothing of why or
                            how. It is but dealing in words to say that the meaning of it all is God's revelation of Himself. Granting that, what is the process

                            realities. His idealistic scheme of history, which makes religion the keynote of progress, and describes the function of
                            each—Judaism to typify duty, Confucianism order, Mahommedanism justice, Buddhism patience, and Christianity love—does not account
                            for the facts of the history enacted by the devotees. It characterizes, not the real process of evolution, but an ideal which
                            history has not realized. Besides, it does not face the question how far religion itself is a product or a cause, or both

                            almost as heated as in the days of the Reformation. It is an exaggeration of the theory which makes it an explanation of all human

                        <p>The content of history always reflects the interests of the age in which it is written. It was so in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and in medieval chronicles. Modern historians began with politics.
                            But as the complex nature of society became more evident in the age of democracy, the economic or sociological history gained
                            ground. Histories of commerce and cities now rank beside those on war and kings, although there are readers still who prefer to
                            follow the pennants of robber barons rather than to watch the slow evolution of modern conditions. The drum-and-trumpet history has
                            its place like that of art, jurisprudence, science or philosophy. Only now we know that no one of these is more than a single
                            glimpse at a vast complex of phenomena, most of which lie for ever beyond our ken.</p>
                        <p>This expansion of interest has intensified specialization. Historians no longer attempt to write world histories ; they form
                            associations of specialists for the purpose. Each historian chooses his own epoch or century and his own subject, and spends his
                            life mastering such traces of it as he can find. His work there enables him to judge of the methods of his fellows, but his own
                            remains restricted by the very wealth of material which has been accumulated on the single subject before him. Thus the great

                        <p>The beginnings of physical science are to be sought in the slow and unconscious observation by primitive races of men of natural
                            occurrences, such as the apparent movements of the heavenly bodies, and in the gradually acquired mastery over the rude implements
                            by the aid of which such men strove to increase the security and comfort of their lives. Biological science similarly must have
                            begun with observation of the plants and animals useful to man, and with empirical medicine and surgery. It was only when a
                            considerable progress had been made with ordered knowledge that men began to ask questions about the meaning and causes of the
                            phenomena, and to discern the connexions between them.</p>
                        <p>In the earliest stage of development it seems that an anthropomorphic or mythological explanation is always assigned to the phenomena
                            of nature. With no clue to trace the regularity of sequence and connexion between those phenomena, an untutored mind inevitably
                            refers the apparently capricious events which succeed each other to the direct and immediate intervention of some unseen being of a
                            nature essentially similar to his own. The sun is the flaming chariot of the sun-god, driven day by day across the heavens; the
                            clouds are cows from which milk descends as nourishing rain on the fruitful earth. We may regard such myths as childlike fancies,
                            but they were doubtless an advance on the want of all explanation which preceded them; they supplied hypotheses which, besides
                            giving rise to themes of beauty and suggestiveness for poetry and art, played the first and chief part of a scientific hypothesis in
                            pointing the way for further inquiry. Much useful knowledge was acquired and much skill gained in logical analysis before these
                            primitive explanations were proved insufficient. A false theory which can be compared with facts may be more useful at a given stage
                            of development than a true one beyond the comprehension of the time, and incapable of examination by observation or experiment by
                            any means then known. The Newtonian theory of gravitation might be useless to a savage, to whose mind the animistic view of nature
                            brought conviction and helpful ideas, which he could test by experience.</p>

                        <p>The phenomena of the heavens are at once the most striking, the most easily observed and the most regular of those which <pb n="397" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0397.png"/> are impressed inevitably on the minds of thinking men. Thus it is to astronomy we must look for the first development of
                            scientific ideas. The orientation of many prehistoric monuments shows that a certain amount of astronomical observation had been
                            acquired at a very early age, and <name type="people">the Chaldeans</name> seem to have gone so far as to recognize a law of
                            periodicity even in eclipses. From the land of Asia the Greeks took their earliest ideas of science, and it is to the Ionian
                            philosophers, of whom <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thales">Thales of Miletus</name> (580 B.C.) is regarded
                            as the first, that we must turn for the earliest known example of an advance on the mythological view of nature. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</name> recognized the rotation of the heavens round the pole
                            star, and saw that the dome overhead was but the half of a complete sphere. The earth was thus deprived of the base stretching to
                            unfathomed depths imagined by the mythologists, and left free to float as a flattened cylinder at the centre of the celestial
                            sphere. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</name>, too, seems to have grasped
                            the doctrine of the uniformity of nature, teaching that all material transformations must have a true cause.</p>
                        <p>Next came <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras">the Pythagoreans</name>, who simplified these conceptions
                            by the suggestion that instead of a rotation of the vast sphere of the heavens the earth itself might be a sphere and revolve about
                            a central fixed point, like a stone at the end of a string. The uninhabited side of the earth always faced the fixed point, and its
                            inhabited side faced successively the different parts of the heavens At the central fixed point they placed a <q>"universal
                                fire,"</q> which, like the fire on an altar, served as a centre for the circling of the worshipping earth. Mythology was losing
                            its hold of science, but mystical symbolism still held sway. When, however, in the 4th century B.C. the growth of geographical
                            discovery failed to disclose any trace of this central fire, the idea of its existence faded away, and was replaced by the
                            conception of the revolution of the earth on its own axis. Finally, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristarchus_of_Samos">Aristarchus</name> (280 B.C.), believing that the sun was larger than the
                            earth, thought it unlikely that it should revolve round the earth, and developed a heliocentric theory. But the time was not ripe;
                            no indisputable evidence could be adduced, no general conviction followed, and to mankind the earth remained the centre of creation
                            till many centuries later. Even to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name>, the visible
                            universe consisted of the central earth with its attendant water, air and aether founded by the sphere of the heavens, which formed
                            the flaming walls of the world—<foreign xml:lang="la">

                        <p>Simultaneously with the birth of astronomy the problem of matter came into being. The old Ionian nature philosophers, observing the
                            sequence of changes from earth and water into the structure of plants and the bodies of animals, and through them again into the
                            original constituents, began to grasp the conception of the indestructibility of matter, and to put forward the idea that all forms
                            of matter might ultimately consist of a single <q>"element."</q> But the conception of a single ultimate basis of matter was far in
                            advance of the age. It is only now becoming a fertile working hypothesis in the light of all the gigantic increase in knowledge of
                            the intervening two thousand years. At the time when it was put forward, the conception was of little use, and the immediate path of
                            advance was found in the idea of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> (450 B.C.) that
                            the primary elements were four: earth, water, air and fire— a solid, a liquid, a gas and the flame which seemed to the ancients a
                            type of matter of still rarer structure. This hypothesis served to interpret the phenomena of nature for many centuries, till, in
                            modern days, the growth of chemistry disclosed the seventy or eighty elements of our text-books. Signs are not wanting that they too
                            have served their turn as a conception of the ultimate nature of matter, while still maintaining their place as the proximate units
                            of chemical action.</p>

                            separate elements in different proportions, he could explain all the endless differences in matter as known to the senses. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> developed the conception and gave to the world the theory of
                            atoms, described at a later date by the Roman poet <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name>.
                            As matter is subdivided does it keep its characteristic properties throughout? Is iron always iron, however finely we divide it; is
                            water always water? Are the properties of any kind of matter ultimate facts of which no explanation—no description in simpler
                            terms—is possible? To avoid answering this last question in the affirmative, and resigning all hope of an advance in knowledge, the
                            atomic theory of the Greeks was framed.</p>
                        <p>To recognize the significance of the doctrines of the Greek Atomists, we must remove from our minds all sense of comparison with the
                            atomic theory of to-day. The Greeks had none of the detailed physical and chemical knowledge on which that theory is founded, and
                            which it was framed to explain. The object of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> was quite different from that of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dalton">Dalton</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amedeo_Avogadro">Avogadro</name>. To the latter, the conception of atoms and molecules served
                            as a means of explaining certain definite and detailed facts of chemical combination and gaseous volume in a more definite and exact
                            way than any other hypothesis available at the time. To the Greek philosophers, the atomic theory was an attempt to make the
                            universe intelligible. The particular explanation offered was not of so much importance as the idea that an explanation of some kind
                            was possible. When we see the beliefs that held sway before their day, we realize the advance their ideas produced. The qualities of
                            substances were thought to be of their essence—the sweetness of sugar was as much a reality as sugar itself, the black colour of
                            water must survive all changes in its form, so that, to one who knew this doctrine, snow could never look white again. It was such
                            confusion as this—such denial of facts if they failed to support a theory—that <ref>
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> assailed:— <quote>"According to convention there is a sweet

                            </ref> Atoms were many in size and shape, but identical in substance. All qualitative differences in substances
                            were to be assigned to differences in size, shape, situation and movement of particles of the same ultimate nature. No attempt was
                            made to examine into the nature of this ultimate substance; but one set of phenomena was expressed in terms of something simpler,
                            and no <q>"explanation"</q> even of the most recondite observation by the most modern physicist can do more.</p>
                        <p>The atomic theory of the Greeks as transmitted to us by the poem of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> presented a wonderfully consistent picture of nature within the limits of the knowledge of their day. It is
                            easy to show where it fails in the light of the knowledge of phenomena we now possess; it is easy to point to places where, as in
                            its application to psychological problems, its authors passed in imagination over logical chasms without even seeing that a
                            difficulty existed. But the attempt to frame an intelligible picture was a great step in advance, and a study of the flaws which we
                            can now detect may serve to suggest the provisional nature of some of the theories by tbe aid of which knowledge is advancing so
                            fast in our own day.</p>
                        <p>But the great difference between the position of the Greeks and that of ourselves in regard to natural knowledge consists in the
                            small number of phenomena known to them contrasted with the enormous wealth of accumulated observation which is available for us, as
                            the result of years of experiment with the aid of apparatus unknown to the ancients. When a new theory is put forward, it is now
                            almost always possible to test its concordance with facts by the use of material already accumulated, or to suggest, in the light of
                            such material, experiments which will serve to refute it, or to lend it greater probability. Thus a theory which survives the trials
                            that follow its birth has nowadays a fairly long expectation of life—probably the theory will serve to interpret phenomena
                            discovered either by its means or in other ways for some time to come. But in the ancient world this was not so. To test a new
                            theory, other phenomena were very rarely available than those which suggested it, or to explain which it was put forward. Thus
                            thought was much more speculative, and, as is still the case with metaphysics, no general consensus of opinion was reached. Each
                            philosopher had a system of his own in science, just as he still has in metaphysics—a system which, beginning from first <pb n="398" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0398.png"/> principles anew, raises on them a superstructure, which, even if it logically follows from them, can have no more validity than
                            the premises on which it is based. When the premises are not accepted by other philosophers, the whole scheme becomes merely the
                            doctrine of one man, and, if it lives at all, may oppress by the dead weight of authority the struggle of living thought beneath
                            it.</p>

                            speed in a vacuum, and that the fact that heavy bodies were observed to fall faster than very light ones was due to the resistance
                            of the air. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus's</name> belief was true, though he was of
                            course quite unconscious of the grounds on which it can alone be demonstrated—the universal attraction of gravity, and the
                            remarkable and curious experimental fact that the weights of bodies are proportional to their masses. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> agrees that in a vacuum all bodies would fall at an equal rate, but
                            the conclusion appears to him so inconceivable that he rejects the idea of the existence of any empty space at all, and with the
                                <q>"void"</q> rejects the rest of the allied concepts of the atomic theory. If all bodies were composed of the same ultimate
                            matter, he argues, they must all be heavy, and nothing would be light in itself and disposed to rise. A large mass of air or fire
                            would then necessarily be heavier than a small mass of earth or water. This result he thinks impossible, for certain bodies always
                            tend upwards and rise faster as their bulk increases. It will be seen that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> has no idea of the conceptions we now call density and specific
                            gravity, though clear views about the question why some things rise through water or air might have been obtained without the aid of
                            physical apparatus. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> doctrine that bodies are
                            essentially heavy or light in themselves persisted all through the middle ages, and did much to delay the attainment of more exact
                            knowledge. It was not till <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</name> (1564-1642)
                            discovered by actual experiment that, in cases where the resistance of the air is negligible, heavy things fall at the same speed as
                            light ones, that the Aristotelian dogma was overthrown.</p>

                        <p>Turning to the biological sciences, we may trace a somewhat similar course of development. Owing to its practical importancc,
                            medicine has left many records by which its progress can be traced. Just as primitive man personified the sun and the moon, the wind
                            and the sea, so he regarded disease as due to the action of some malignant demon or to the spells of some human enemy. Once more
                            Greek literature enables us to trace the gradual decrease in the importance assigned to charms and magic, and the growth of more
                            rational ideas among physicians. But here, as in the physical sciences, the philosophic range of the intellect of the Greeks led
                            them astray. Assumptions as to the nature of man or the origin of organic life were too often made the starting point of a train of
                            deductive reasoning, the consequences of which were not always compared with the results of observation and experiment, even where
                            such comparison was possible. The Greek philosophers tried to make bricks without straw, usually in sublime unconsciousness that
                            straw was necessary. Many centuries of humble observation and tentative fitting together of small parts of the great puzzle were
                            needed before enough material was collected to make possible useful generalizations about the questions, answers to which the Greeks
                            assumed as the very basis of their inquiries.</p>
                        <p>Among the multitude of their guesses, a few somewhat resembled the views that are now again rising into prominence from the basis of
                            definite and exact experiment. A good example of the strength and weakness of ancient speculation is found in the cosmogony of the
                            atomists, both on its physical and on its biological side. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> describes how the world was formed by the conjunction of streams of atoms, which condensed into the earth,
                            with its attendant water, air and aether, to form a self-contained whole. Unconscious of the mighty gap between inorganic matter and
                            living beings, he proceeds to tell how, in the chances of infinite time, all possible forms of life appeared, while only those
                            fittest to survive persisted and reared offspring. Here, surrounded by unsupported statements and false conclusions, we see dimly
                            the germs of the ideas of the nebular hypothesis and the theory of natural selection, though <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> had the profoundest ignorance of the difficulties of the problem,
                            and the vast stretches of time necessary for cosmical and biological development.</p>
                        <p>In those branches of biological science in which less ambitious theorizing and more detailed observation were forced on the Greeks,
                            considerable progress was made. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> compiled a
                            laborious account of the animals known in his day, with many accurate details of their anatomical structure. Beginning from an
                            earlier date, steady advance was made with geographical discovery. Maps of the known world, developed from the local maps invented
                            by the Egyptians for the purposes of landsurveying, gave definiteness to the knowledge thus acquired and showed its bearing on wider
                            problems.</p>

                        <p>One of the most striking successes of Greek thought is seen in the development of geometry. Geometry has a twofold importance, as
                            being itself the study of the properties of the space known to our senses, and as teaching us methods and means of studying nature
                            by unfolding the full logical consequences of any hypothesis: geometry is the best type of deductive reasoning. Based on axioms, the
                            result of simple experience, it traces from the ideas of solids, surfaces, lines and points the properties of other figures defined
                            in terms of those ideas. As an example to other sciences, the deductive geometry of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid</name> (c. 300 B.C.) had, perhaps, an unfortunate influence in emphasizing the
                            deductive method, and teaching men to neglect the need of verifying by experiment the theories put forward to explain the more
                            complex phenomena of nature at the conclusion, and at each possible step, of the deduction. But, in itself, the science of Euclidian
                            geometry was brought to such a state of perfection that no advance was made till modern times: no change even in form attempted till
                            quite recently. Unlike some other branches of inquiry we have mentioned, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid's</name> geometry carried universal conviction, and represented a permanent step
                            in advance which never had to be retraced.</p>

                        <p>Alongside the study of individual sciences, the Greeks paid even more attention to the laws of thought, and to the examination of the
                            essence of the methods by which knowledge in general is acquired. In opposition to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato's</name> theory that all knowledge is but the unfolding and development of
                            forgotten memories of a previous state of existence, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> taught that we learn to reach the generalizations, which alone the Greeks regarded as knowledge, by
                            remembering, comparing and co-ordinating numerous particular acts or judgments of sense, which are thus used as a means of gaining
                            knowledge by the action of the innate and infallible nous or intellect. Neither <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> nor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> could be satisfied without finding infallibility somewhere. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, it is true, investigated the logical processes by which we pass
                            from particular instances to general propositions, and laid stress on the importance of observing the facts before generalizing
                            about them, but he had little appreciation of the conditions in which observation and the induction based on it must be conducted in
                            practice in order to obtain results where the probability of error is a minimum. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> regarded induction merely as a necessary preliminary to true
                            science of the deductive type best seen in geometry, and, in applying his principles, he never reached the <q>"positive"</q> stage,
                            in which metaphysical problems are evaded, if not excluded, <pb n="399" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0399.png"/> and a scheme of natural knowledge built up in a consistent
                            manner, so that metaphysical ideas, though they may underlie the foundation of the ultimate conceptions, do not intrude between the
                            parts of the building. Hence <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> explanations often
                            turn directly on metaphysical ideas such as form, cause, substance, terms which do not occur (in the Aristotelian sense) in modern
                            scientific terminology.</p>

                        <p>A century later than the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes of Syracuse</name> (287 to 212 B.C.) formulated the
                            fundamental conceptions of hydrostatics and took what may be regarded origin of as the first step in the science of mechanics. The
                            use of the lever must have been discovered at a very early date, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes</name> set to work to investigate its quantitative laws by the
                            application of principles learnt from the geometers. He begins by laying down two axioms : (1) Equal weights placed at equal
                            distances from the point of support of a bar will balance: (2) Equal weights placed at unequal distances do not balance, but that
                            which hangs at the greater distance descends. The ancient philosophers based such axioms as the first of these two on the
                                <q>"principle of sufficient reason."</q> No motion can take place, because, from the symmetry of the system, there is no reason
                            why the balance should descend on one side more than the other. Even if we grant the theoretical validity of this principle, it is
                            impossible to make sure without trial that the system in any given case is really symmetrical. Electrification of the bar, for
                            instance, though imperceptible to our senses, would cause one end to descend if an oppositely electrified body were placed near that
                            end; we cannot assume without trial that the position of the sun, or the colour of the arms, will not affect the result. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes</name> based the second axiom on the sounder ground of
                            direct experience. On these two axioms he proceeded to construct an elaborate deductive proof of the numerical law of the lever,
                            but, in the course of it, he assumed as known the principle of the centre of gravity. In reality, this principle is identical with
                            that of the lever, and assuming one, implicitly we assume the other. Nevertheless, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes'</name> proof is of use and interest. On the assumptions made, it shows
                            the connexion between the general case of the lever with unequal arms, and the special and more familiar case when the arms are
                            equal. Indeed, if we also treat the principle of the centre of gravity as an axiom known by experience, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes'</name> proof is a true type of all scientific <q>"explanations"</q>; it
                            reduces an unfamiliar phenomenon to others already well known to our minds, which, creatures of habit as they are, regard the
                            familiar cases as in no need of explanation. Nowadays we should treat the law of the lever of unequal arms as one that is verified
                            by direct and familiar experiment, and use it, in its turn, as the starting point for further deduction.</p>

                            were sown which germinating after the lapse of centuries, developed in the more fruitful soil of the age of experiment. But for a
                            time they were buried, and only remembered by compendiums written just before the ancient light was wholly lost. During the dark
                            ages, the contents of secular learning, based on those compendiums, settled down into the elementary <q>"trivium,"</q> consisting of
                            grammar, rhetoric and dialectic, and the more advanced <q>"quadrivium"</q> music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy. Music included
                            a halfmystical doctrine of numbers and the rules of plainsong; geometry consisted of a selection of the propositions of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid</name> without the demonstrations; while arithmetic and astronomy
                            were cultivated chiefly because they taught the means of finding Easter. Meanwhile, the early alchemists of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, by the aid of mystical analogies with the conceptions of

                            of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>, saturated as they were with the logical
                            subtleties of dialectic. This controversy originated the long debate on the reality of universals, which absorbed the intellectual
                            energies of many generations of men. Did reality belong only to the idea or universal—to the class rather than to the individual—to
                            the common humanity of mankind, for instance, rather than to each isolated being? Or were the individuals the reality, and the
                            universals mere names? In this question, trivial, almost meaningless, as it seems at first sight, logical analysis disclosed to the
                            medieval mind the whole theory of the universe. Either answer contained danger to theological orthodoxy as then understood; hence
                            the fervour with which it was debated. But, as communication with the East was reopened early in the 13th century, Latin
                            translations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> works gradually were recovered;
                            the whole of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> philosophy was reimported into the
                            schools of Europe, and reconciled and adopted by Christian theology. For three hundred years <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> reigned supreme in European thought, and exponents of the
                            scholastic philosophy, ignoring their master's teaching on the need of experiment, settled questions of fact as well as those of
                            opinion by an appeal to his books. But outside the academic schools of the newly founded universities, experiment was kept alive by

                                Renaissance</name> was not, as it is sometimes represented, a sudden break with medievalism and a birth of the modern world. But
                            a number of conditions favourable to rapid development happened to coincide, and, in the course of a century, men's outlook on
                            themselves and on nature became profoundly modified. The recovery of the Greek language, the voyages of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christopher_Columbus">Columbus</name>, the decay of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Roman_Empire">the Western</name>

                            of the universe which had been current among the Greeks, in place of the mystical aspect which it wore to the medieval schoolmen and
                            ecclesiastics. At first the tendency was to substitute the authority of the ancients for the authority of the schoolmen, but
                            gradually more independence of thought was secured; men like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</name> (1452-1519) began to experiment and to record their results; <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</name> (1473-1543) revived the heliocentric theory,
                            and showed how the accumulated mass of astronomical observations could be interpreted by its means; and anatomy began again to be
                            studied in the schools of medicine, gradually making its way in face of the prejudice against mutilating the human body.</p>

                        <p>The philosophy of the new experimental methods was first studied deeply by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</name> (1561-1626). Sensible of the confused and disjointed
                            information which then constituted the only scientific knowledge, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> set himself to describe a new method by which definite knowledge
                            might be acquired with certainty. Warned by the failure of the scholastic methods, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> laid exclusive stress on experimental research, and it was perhaps
                            natural that he should incline to the other extreme and ignore almost entirely the use of hypothesis and the deductive method. To
                            arrive at the underlying causes, said <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name>, we must
                            study the <pb n="400" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0400.png"/> natural history of the phenomena, collect and tabulate all obseravtions which bear on them, notice which
                            phenomena are related in such a way as to vary together, and then, by a merely mechanical process of exclusion, we discover the
                            cause of any given phenomenon. As a corrective of the medieval philosophy <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon's</name> work was of the greatest value in the history of thought, and,
                            from this point of view, it is perhaps but a small drawback that scientific discovery is seldom or never made by the pure Baconian
                            method. The multitude of phenomena are too great for any subject to be attacked with success without the aid of hypothesis framed by
                            the use of the scientific imagination. Facts are collected to prove or disprove the consequences deduced from the hypothesis, and
                            thus the number of facts to be examined becomes manageable.</p>

                        <p>Even while <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> was philosophizing, the true method was
                            being used by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</name> (1564-1642) to found the
                            science of dynamics. We have seen how the Aristotelians held the belief that every body sought its natural place, the place of heavy
                            bodies being below and that of light ones above. Innate qualities of heaviness and lightness were thus invoked to explain why some
                            things fell, and others, in similar circumstances, rose. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name>, rightly rejecting the whole current point of view, set himself to examine not why, but how, things fell. This
                            change of attitude was in itself one of his great achievements. Now a falling body starts from rest and falls with a speed which is
                            increasing constantly. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name> sought to find the law
                            of increase. To isolate the real law out of all possible laws he made a guess at a simple law which seemed likely to be true. He
                            assumed that the speed acquired is proportional to the distance fallen through. But, working out the consequences of this
                            hypothesis, he soon convinced himself that it involved a contradiction. He abandoned the hypothesis and made another. He supposed
                            that the speed was proportional to the time of fall. Again he deduced mathematically the consequences of this new hypothesis, and,
                            finding no inconsistencies, put some of his deductions to the test of experiment, and verified their accuracy. Thus <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name> proved mathematically that, if the speed of fall
                            is proportional to the time from the moment of starting, the space traversed by a falling body must be proportional to the square of
                            the time of fall. To verify this result experimentally, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name> convinced himself that a body falling down an inclined plane acquired a speed which is the same as that it would
                            have attained in falling through the same vertical height. He was able therefore to use a slow fall down a plane for his experiments
                            instead of the unmanageably rapid course of a body falling freely. Nor was this all. From this stage of the investigation another
                            consequence of his results was found to spring. A ball after running down an inclined plane of a certain height will run up another
                            plane of the same height irrespective of its inclination—that is, if friction be small. The second plane may be made very long, but
                            still, if its final height be the same, the ball will reach its end. Hence it is the height that matters; none of the speed of the
                            ball is destroyed unless it rises. If the second plane be made horizontal, the ball will thus run on for ever unless stopped by
                            friction or some other applied force. This fundamental result, put into definite words by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name>, is known as the first law of motion, and is the foundation of the
                            whole science of dynamics. In <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo's</name> day it was an
                            entirely new conception. It has been assumed that every motion required some cause or force to maintain it. Hence arose the need of
                            hypothetical vortices to maintain planetary movements, and similar complications in astronomy and mechanics. But it now became
                            evident that it was not the continuous motion of the planets which needed explanation, but the constant deflection of that motion
                            from the straight path it would hold if no applied force were in action. The way was open for Newton.</p>

                            observed motion of the planets about the sun could be explained, and explained only, by the supposition that the sun exerted a force
                            on each planet proportional inversely to the square of its distance from the planet. But the earth, at any rate, does attract bodies
                            on or near its surface, the phenomenon being the familiar but mysterious gravity. Is this force competent to account for the motion
                            of the moon round the earth? On the assumption of the law of inverse squares, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> calculated what the known force of gravity would become at the
                            distance of the moon. Owing to faulty data, his first result indicated that the force would be too great, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> put aside his calculations. Six years later a new determination of
                            the size of the earth gave him a new basis for calculation, and, in an excitement so great that he could hardly see his figures,
                                <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> found that the fall of a stone to the earth and
                            the sweep of the moon in her orbit were due to the same cause. The mechanism by means of which the force is exerted remained
                            unrevealed to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name>, and has baffled all inquirers since

                        <p>These speculations, isolated at first, coalesced with the more detailed conclusions of geology during the 19th century. The earlier
                            conceptions of the origin of the rocks of the earth imagined catastrophes of fire or water, processes alien to those of everyday
                            experience. But the <q>"uniformitarian"</q> school, founded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Hutton">James Hutton</name> (1726-1797) and expounded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Lyell">Sir
                                Charles Lyell</name> (1797-1875), produced evidence to show that much, at any rate, of the structure of the surface of the globe
                            was produced by the action of causes and processes still going on under our eyes. The deposition of material by the action of seas
                            and rivers and other natural agencies, e.g. volcanoes, etc., was seen to need only time enough to produce beds of rock like those
                            which make up our mountains. Comparison of the fossil remains of plants and animals found in different kinds of rock then enabled
                            geologists to classify the rocks, and place them in a chronological sequence. Moreover, it became evident that a series of animal
                            and plant types was associated with the gradual formation of the rocks, and that the age both of the earth itself and of the organic
                            life found on it was much greater than had been suspected. The few thousand years of received cosmogonies stretched out into untold
                            millions, during which the same familiar laws described the phenomena of development. The remains and traces of man, found, it is
                            true, only in the later sedimentary deposits of the earth, still were enough to prove his existence through ages beside which the
                            dawn of history was but as yesterday. As <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> had
                            extended known principles throughout the gigantic spaces of the heavens, so the later geologists pushed them back over enormous
                            epochs of time. The extent of the kingdom of ordered knowledge expanded both in space and time to a degree truly marvellous.</p>

                            separate and distinct species now existent. From the point of view of scientific thought, the significance of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin's</name> theory lies in the new and vast extension it gives to the field
                            in which causes intelligible to the human mind can be sought as explanations of phenomena. Thus evolution is co-ordinated in the
                            history of thought with the Newtonian theory of gravitation, and with the uniformitarian theory of geology.</p>

                            biologists devoted their attention to the study of how the useful variations arise. Three views have been held. (1) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Jean Baptiste, chevalier de Lamarck</name> (1744-1829),
                            regarded variation as due to the accumulated and inherited effect of use. Thus the giraffe acquires his long neck by the successive
                            efforts of countless generations to browse on leaves just beyond their reach. (2) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name>, while accepting changes in accordance with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Lamarck's</name> ideas as exceptional aids to variation, revolutionized
                            biology by showing the primary importance of the struggle for life, when extended over long periods of time, in selecting useful
                            variations which arise accidentally or in other ways. (3) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name> also recognized the possible occasional effect of discontinuous variations or <quote>"sports,"</quote> when a
                            plant or an animal diverges from its parents in a marked manner. But of late years the study by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugo_de_Vries">Hugo de Vries</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Bateson">William Bateson</name> and others, of discontinuous variations which arise
                            spontaneously has pointed to the conclusion that in nature such sudden leaps are the normal cause of development. If a
                                <q>"sport"</q> has advantages over the parental type, it tends to survive, while, if it is not as fitted for its life struggle,
                            it is destroyed by natural selection and never establishes itself. Such a theory avoids the difficulty of pure <q>"Darwinism,"</q>
                            that organs useful, when fully developed, to an animal or plant are of no advantage in incipient stages. Statistical methods, too,
                            suggest that a definite limit may exist to the amount of a given variation which proceeds by small steps, each insignificant in
                            itself.</p>

                        <p>Closely connected with such problems is the question of inheritance. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Lamarck's</name> theory required the inheritance of characteristics
                            acquired during the life of a parent. But difficulties, such as that of seeing how such a change could affect the simple germ cells,
                            has led some more recent biologists to pass to the other extreme, and to deny the possibility of any acquired characteristic being
                            transmitted to offspring.</p>

                        <p>A new light has been thrown on the problem of inheritance by the recent re-discovery of the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregor_Mendel">G.J. Mendel, abbot of Brunn</name> (1822-1884). Certain characters in both
                            plants and animals have been found to be separable, and some of these characters exist in pairs, so that the presence of one
                            involves the absence of the other. To take a simple example. Blue Andalusian fowls do not breed <q>"true."</q> On the average, half
                            the offspring of two blue parents are blue, while the remaining half are divided equally between black and white birds. Both black
                            and white when mated with a consort of the same colour breed <q>"true"</q> and yield only offspring similar to the parents. A white
                            bird mated with a black, however, produces invariably all blue chicks. White mated with blue gives half blue and half white, while
                            black mated with blue gives half blue and half black. Such phenomena are explained if we suppose that of the germ cells of the blue
                            birds half bear the black character and half the white. If, in reproduction, a <q>"black"</q> cell meets a <q>"black"</q> the
                            resulting chick is black; if <q>"white"</q> meets <q>"white"</q> the chick is white; while if <q>"white"</q> meets <q>"black"</q>
                            the chick possesses a mixture of the two characters which in this case yield blue colour. But the reproductive cells of this
                            intermediate form are not intermediate in character; they possess the pure parental characters in equal numbers. Knowing these
                            facts, it is evident that we can reproduce any of the results at will, and from the mixed blue type produce a pure true breed of
                            either black or white birds. Experiments of this kind must lead to a power of breeding new varieties of plants and animals hitherto
                            undreamed of, and already have changed altogether our views of the problems of heredity. Instead of a vague mixture of all our
                            ancestors, we possess definite characteristics of some of them only, though, like the blue Andalusian fowl, we may transmit to our
                            children ancestral characters we do not ourselves exhibit. The family or race is more important in heredity than the individual
                            parent. Thus the aristocratic theory of politics receives support from the experience of biology.</p>

                        <p>Simultaneously with the growth of geology, and the birth of the Darwinian hypothesis, a new development took place in physical
                            science—the development of the conception of energy as a quantity invariable in amount throughout a series of physical changes. The
                            genesis of the idea in its modern form may be traced in the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christiaan_Huygens">C. Huygens</name> (1629-1695), who applied it to the problems of pure
                            dynamics. But, in the middle of the 19th century, by the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Prescott_Joule">James Prescott Joule</name> (1818-1889), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</name> (1824-1907), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hermann_von_Helmholtz">H.L.F. von Helmholtz</name> (1821-1894), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">J. Willard Gibbs</name> (1839-1903), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudolf_Clausius">R.J.E. Clausius</name> (1822-1888) and others, it was extended to physical
                            processes. The amount of heat produced by friction was found to bear a constant proportion to the work expended, and this
                            experimental result led to the conception of an invariable quantity of something, to which the name of energy was given, manifesting
                            itself in various forms such as heat or mechanical work. Energy thus took its place beside mass as a real quantity, conserved
                            throughout a series of physical changes. Of late years, as we shall see below, evidence has appeared to show that mass is not
                            absolutely constant, but may depend on the velocity when the velocity approaches that of light. Since the only essential quality of
                            matter is its mass, this result seems to strike at the root of the metaphysical conception of matter as a real, invariable quantity.
                            It remains to be seen whether the conception of energy as an invariable quantity will hold its place or give way to some similar
                            modification as science develops. But, in the present state of knowledge, we may accept the principle of the conservation of energy
                            as one of the most firmly established of physical laws.</p>
                        <p>The amount of energy in an isolated system remains invariable, but, if changes are going on in the system, the energy tends
                            continually to become less and less available for the performance of useful work. All heat engines require a difference of
                            temperature— a boiler and refrigerator, or their equivalents. We cannot continue to transform heat into mechanical work if all
                            available objects are at a uniform temperature. But, if temperature differences exist, they tend to equalize themselves by
                            irreversible processes of thermal conduction, and it becomes increasingly difficult to get useful work out of the supplies of heat.
                            In an isolated system, then, equilibrium will be reached when this process of <q>"dissipation of energy"</q> is complete, and, from
                            this single principle, the whole theory of the equilibrium of physical and chemical systems was worked out by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">Willard Gibbs</name>. Such a method avoids altogether the use of atomic
                            and molecular conceptions. In fact, some supporters of the theory of <q>"energetics"</q> expressly disclaim the conceptions of
                            natural atoms and molecules as unnecessary and misleading, and prefer to found all science on the idea of energy. Matter, they
                            argue, is known to us only as a vehicle for energy, and may itself be but a manifestation of that energy.</p>

                        <p>But the other great line of advance in recent physics, although it may lead us in the end to somewhat similar conclusions, has been
                            traced by a method which used atomic and molecular conceptions in an extreme form. The passage of electricity through liquids had
                            been explained by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</name> (1791-1867) and
                            others as a transference of a succession of electric charges carried by <pb n="402" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0402.png"/> moving particles of matter or ions. At the end
                            of the 19th century these ideas were extended, chiefly by the labours of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">J.J. Thomson</name>, to elucidate also the conduction of electricity through
                            gases. In 1897 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">Thomson</name> discovered that, in certain cases,
                            the moving particles which carried the electric current were of much smaller mass than the smallest chemical atom, that of hydrogen,
                            and that these minute particles, to which he gave the name of corpuscles, were identical from whatever substance they were obtained.
                            They enter into the structure of all matter, and form a common constituent of all chemical atoms. The only known properties of these
                            corpuscles are their mass and their electric charge. Now, a charged body when set in motion spreads electromagnetic energy into the
                            surrounding medium. Thus, more force is needed to produce a given acceleration than if the body were uncharged. The body acts as
                            though its mass were greater than when it is uncharged. Now there is reason to believe that the whole apparent mass of the minute
                            corpuscles to which we have referred is an effect of their electric charge. The idea of a material particle thus disappears with
                            that of material mass, and the corpuscle becomes an isolated unit of electricity— an electron. It is impossible to resist making the
                            speculation that the whole of an atom is made up of electrons, and that mass is to be explained in terms of electricity, though it
                            must be pointed out that there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Another train of reasoning, starting from a different point, reinforces this result. The phenomena of the interference of beams of
                            light in certain circumstances, to produce darkness or colour, indicate that light is some form of wave motion, and, to carry these
                            waves, a hypothetical luminiferous aether was invented. The theoretical work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Clerk_Maxwell">J. Clerk Maxwell</name> (1831-1879) and the experiments of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Hertz">H.R. Hertz</name> (1857-1894) showed that the properties and
                            velocity of propagation of light and of electromagnetic waves were identical and that their other properties differed only in
                            degree. Thus light became an electromagnetic phenomenon. But light is started by some form of atomic vibration, and to start an
                            electromagnetic wave requires a moving electric charge. Thus electric charges must exist within the atom, and we are led again to
                            the theory of electrons by the road opened up by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hendrik_Lorentz">H.A.
                                Lorentz</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Larmor">Joseph Larmor</name>. Such a theory
                            suggests the occasional instability of the atom, and the phenomena of radioactivity, shown in a remarkable form by the substance
                            radium, discovered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Curie">M.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marie_Curie">Mme.

                            of the atom. The evolutionary view of nature, established in the biological and sociological sciences, is thus extended to physical
                            science, not only in the development of planets and suns, but even in the chemical atoms, hitherto believed indestructible and
                            eternal.</p>

                        <p>As we have seen, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</name> described a new method of
                            discovery in which exclusive attention was paid to the collection and tabulation of facts, with a view to the detection of relations
                            between them, and the consequent reference of <q>"effects"</q> to their proper <q>"causes."</q> Impressed by the barrenness of the a
                            priori methods of the Schoolmen, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> in his philosophy
                            went to the other extreme. The use of the Baconian method in its purity would be too laborious for success. Some guide is necessary
                            in the collection of facts at an early stage of our investigations. Here the scientific imagination is brought into play, and some
                            hypothesis is framed to explain the phenomena under investigation. The hypothesis may be suggested by the theories which are
                            accepted at the time in cognate branches of knowledge, or it may be suggested by the few isolated facts already known or just
                            discovered in the phenomena to be considered. From this new hypothesis, consequences are deduced by processes of logical
                            reasoning—consequences which may be put to the test by comparison with the results of observation or experiment. If agreement is
                            found, the hypothesis is, so far, confirmed, and gains in authority with every fresh concordance discovered. If the deductions from
                            the hypothesis do not agree with the accepted interpretation of facts, the hypothesis may need modification, it may have to be
                            abandoned altogether, or the want of concordance may point to some error or inconsistency in the fundamental concepts on which the
                            hypothesis is based—the whole framework of that branch of science may need revision, as the idea of heat as a caloric substance had
                            to be abandoned under the pressure of the experiments of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Prescott_Joule">Joule</name> on the equivalence between work done and heat developed. But the ultimate test of the validity of our knowledge
                            can only be the consistency with each other of the parts of the whole scheme. If the received interpretation of one set of phenomena
                            is not consistent with that of another, one or other or both of the interpretations must be wrong if we make the assumption
                            necessary for all knowledge, namely, that the universe is intelligible to a mind capable of dealing with its complexity.</p>

                        <p>In early times, when the knowledge of nature was small, little attempt was made to divide science into parts, and men of science did
                            not specialize. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> was a master of all science known
                            in his day, and wrote indifferently treatises on physics or animals. As increasing knowledge made it impossible for any one man to
                            grasp all scientific subjects, lines of division were drawn for convenience of study and of teaching. Besides the broad distinction
                            into physical and biological science, minute subdivisions arose, and, at a certain stage of development, much attention was given to
                            methods of classification, and much emphasis laid on the results, which were thought to have a significance beyond that of the mere
                            convenience of mankind.</p>
                        <p>But we have reached the stage when the different streams of knowledge, followed by the different sciences, are coalescing, and the
                            artificial barriers raised by calling those sciences by different names are breaking down. Geology uses the methods and data of
                            physics, chemistry and biology; no one can say whether the science of radioactivity is to be classed as chemistry or physics, or
                            whether sociology is properly grouped with biology or economics. Indeed, it is often just where this coalescence of two subjects
                            occurs, when some connecting channel between them is opened suddenly, that the most striking advances in knowledge take place. The
                            accumulated experience of one department of science, and the special methods which have been developed to deal with its problems,
                            become suddenly available in the domain of another department, and many questions insoluble before may find answers in the new light
                            cast upon them. Such considerations show us that science is in reality one, though we may agree to look on it now from one side and
                            now from another as we approach it from the standpoint of physics, physiology or psychology.</p>

                        <p>Having traced the development of the most important of the fundamental conceptions of science, and followed the subdivision of
                            natural knowledge into the various sections which for convenience mankind has made, let us now examine the meaning of the knowledge
                            thus acquired, and its relation to other branches of learning.</p>
                        <p>By the slow and laborious methods of observation, hypothesis, deduction, and experimental verification, a scheme has been constructed
                            which for the most part is consistent with itself, and bears the test of the comparison of one part with another. As a chart is
                            drawn by the explorer of unknown seas to represent his discoveries in a conventional manner, so the scientific investigator
                            constructs a mental model of the phenomena he observes, and tests its consistency with itself and its concordance with the results
                            of further experiment. The chart does not give a lifelike picture of the coast as does a painting, but it represents one aspect of
                            it conventionally in a manner best adapted for the immediate purpose. So the conceptions of one branch of science— mechanics let us
                            say—represent the phenomena of nature in the conventional aspect best suited for one particular line of inquiry. It does not follow
                            necessarily that <q>"nature"</q> in reality resembles the particular mental chart which mechanical science enables us to construct.
                            It does not even follow that there is any <q>"reality"</q> underlying phenomena and corresponding with any of our conceptions. The
                            whole problem which mankind has to face <pb n="403" facs="images/EncBrit/EncBrit.11.24.0403.png"/> undoubtedly includes an inquiry into the ultimate nature of reality. But that
                            inquiry lies in the province of metaphysics, and is not necessarily involved in the pursuit of natural science. Metaphysics uses the
                            results of natural science, as of all other branches of learning, as evidence bearing on her own deeper and more difficult
                            questions. But it does not follow that natural science must solve metaphysical problems before being of use to man and enlarging the
                            sphere of his knowledge. We need not ask whether the reality is represented accurately by our conventional model, whether indeed
                            there be any reality at all, before using that model to introduce order into what would otherwise be mental confusion, and to enable
                            us to make systematic and progressive use of natural resources. It is true that the possibility of constructing consistent schemes
                            of scientific concepts is an argument in favour of the existence of a definite reality underlying phenomena resembling in some
                            respects the pictures of it we draw. But metaphysicians are not agreed that it is a conclusive argument. The difficulty of making a
                            scientific picture of the ultimate nature of reality may be illustrated by an example. Our first conception of a wooden stick
                            involves the ideas of a certain long-shaped form, of smoothness, of hardness, of weight, of a certain brown colour, perhaps of some
                            amount of elasticity. A microscope reveals a structure much more detailed than we imagined, and our mental model of the stick ceases
                            to be smooth It becomes co-ordinated with those of a number of other bodies' which we know to be parts of trees, and study, as
                            regards growth and structure, by the help of botany. From the results of observation and experiment, physics teaches us that the
                            properties of the stick can only be represented satisfactorily by imagining that the substance of it is not infinitely divisible,
                            that it consists of discontinuous particles or molecules. Again, chemistry assures us that the molecules of the stick are made up of
                            still smaller parts or atoms, which separate from each other when, for instance, the stick is burned, and afterwards can arrange
                            themselves into new molecules. When we pursue our inquiries into the nature of these atoms, we find that they can be resolved,
                            partly at any rate, into much smaller particles or corpuscles in continual motion within the atom. These corpuscles themselves have
                            been identified with isolated units of negative electricity or electrons, the vibrations of which within the atom sort out the
                            electromagnetic radiation which falls on them and allow to reach our eyes those waves only which give us the sensation of brown
                            colour. At present pioneers are attempting to explain electrons in terms of centres of elastic strain in a hypothetical aether. But
                            we have travelled far from our original conception of the nature of the stick, and, should the problem last stated be solved, we
                            should only find ourselves faced by the next one, the nature of the aether. But what constitutes reality? Where, in the endless
                            chain of explanations discovered or to be discovered, can we stop and say: <q>"Here is the true picture of what the stick is"</q>?
                            But this impossibility does not prevent us from getting the full use of each conception in turn when used for its particular
                            purpose. To the schoolboy, the effective and deterrent conception of the stick is that of a hard, elastic, long-shaped solid. The
                            botanist regards it as built up by the action of vegetable cells, which he refers to a particular kind of tree. To the chemist the
                            stick is made up of atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, each with definite properties and arranged in certain combinations. The
                            physicist sees these atoms composed of whirling electrons, each an ultimate electric unit not capable of further explanation, or
                            possibly a centre of strain in an all-pervading aether of unknown nature. Each idea is useful in turn, and each corresponds truly
                            with certain properties of the stick, corresponds with the stick itself in certain of its aspects.</p>
                        <p>Such considerations show us the meaning of the subdivisions into which science has been arranged for convenience of study and
                            research. They represent different aspects of nature, different sections, as it were, cut through the solid model which stands for
                            the sum of all our scientific knowledge of the universe.</p>
                        <p>A nerve-impulse may be regarded from a psychological aspect when we deal with the thought which accompanied it; from a physiological
                            aspect when we examine its relation to other changes in the body. But modern methods have co-ordinated it also with definite
                            chemical and electrical changes, and are said sometimes to have <q>"explained"</q> the nerve-impulse in physical terms.</p>
                        <p>But, as always, an <q>"explanation"</q> proves to be simply a restatement of a phenomenon in terms of other phenomena which
                            previously are familiar to the mind, and therefore appear to be better understood. Nevertheless, from our present point of view, no
                            one of these possible aspects of the phenomenon—of the nerve impulse— is essentially more fundamental than any other. To the
                            psychologist the nerve-impulse is expressed in terms of thought, to the physicist by physical changes. The fact that a thought is
                            accompanied by movement of matter or electricity does not make the thought less a fundamental conception.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps the best illustration is to be sought in the relation between the physical concepts of matter and electricity. As we have
                            seen, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">J.J. Thomson</name> discovered corpuscles which were
                            common constituents of all matter, with masses smaller than those of any known atoms. One of these corpuscles represents a unit of
                            negative electricity. An atom with a corpuscle in excess is an atom negatively electrified, an atom with one corpuscle less than the
                            normal number is an atom positively electrified. In this scheme electricity is described in terms of matter. But these corpuscles
                            have been identified with the hypothetical electrons of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hendrik_Lorentz">Lorentz</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Larmor">Larmor</name>, who consider matter to be
                            composed of such isolated units of electricity. Such electrons, it has been shown, would possess mass by virtue of their
                            electromagnetic properties. In this theory the idea of mechanical mass is eliminated altogether, and mass, and therefore matter,
                            explained in terms of electricity. The view has been held by some that a mechanical explanation of a phenomenon is fundamental, and
                            that a phenomenon so explained in terms of mechanical conceptions is fully understood. This idea may be traced to the familiarity
                            with mechanical conceptions of our everyday experience. The mind obtains its concept of matter from the resistance which that matter
                            manifests to forces tending to set it in motion when at rest, or to change its state of motion when travelling. This fundamental
                            property of inertia is the measure of mass, and we reach the concept of mass by our muscular sense of the force needed to set mass
                            in motion. Force seems to be a direct sense perception, though mathematically it is better to define force in terms of acceleration
                            and mass—since mass is found normally to keep constant throughout a series of physical changes. The familiarity we feel, then, with
                            the conception of matter is based on our familiarity with the conception of force. Our minds form this conception from their
                            experience of a direct sense perception of muscular effort. This seems to be the basis of the whole feeling that mechanical
                            conceptions are more fundamental than any others, and that, for instance, it is more intelligible to explain electricity in terms of
                            mechanics than vice versa. But the fact that we have a special muscular sense is an accident of our bodies. It is possible that the
                            electric fish, or torpedo, has a special electric sense, and that to such a fish-philosopher the perception of electromotive force
                            is more real than that of mechanical force. Such a being might well argue that it is intelligible and satisfactory to explain the
                            mysterious concept of mass, which he only reaches through the other equally mysterious concept of mechanical force, in terms of the
                            familiar concept of electricity, well known to every torpedo from his direct sense perception of electromotive force. This instance
                            may serve to show that it is quite as correct philosophically to explain matter in terms of electricity, as to explain electricity
                            in terms of mass. The object of science is to find connexions between phenomena and thus to correlate them. At present a greater
                            simplification may be reached by reducing all possible phenomena to mechanical conceptions than in any other way, but that only
                            shows that the mechanical aspect of nature gives us a fuller view than any other at present known, not that mechanics is
                            philosophically the most fundamental science.</p>

                            entities, but with the political composition of society as a whole, the word state expresses the abstract idea of government in
                            general, or the governing authority as opposed to the governed, and is thus used by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbert_Spencer">Herbert Spencer</name> in all his discussions of government and society.

                        <p>In international law the term has a more precise meaning, according to which the state is the external personality or outward agency
                            of an independent community. In its fullest form its attributes are: <list>
                                <item>(a) possession of sovereign power to pledge the community in its relations with other similarly sovereign
                                    communities,</item>
                                <item>(b) independence of all external control,</item>
                                <item>and (c) dominion over a determinate territory</item>
                            </list>. In practice, however, there are still incomplete forms of states which join in the international life of states, paramount
                            states whose relations to subordinate parts of their empire are in a condition of uncertainty, and there is, at any rate, one body
                            carrying on international state intercourse without dominion over any territory at all. Thus, Great Britain has diplomatic
                            relations, purely formal though they may be, with several of the subordinate states forming the German Empire. Egypt, while legally
                            under the suzerainty of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Porte">the Porte</name>, is practically a British
                            protectorate. Great Britain treats Cyprus as a dependency, though she is in mere occupation of the island for the purpose of
                            carrying out certain reforms for the protection of Christians. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria–Hungary">Austria-Hungary</name> considered herself in the same position, though she
                            occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina<quote>"without affecting the rights of sovereignty of his majesty the Sultan on those

                                    Sultan,"</quote>
                            </ref>Turkey did not consider her suzerainty to involve her in the war of 1885 between her vassal and
                            Serbia. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">The Roman Catholic Church</name> has
                            permanent diplomatic relations as an independent state, though it has no independent territory against which international rights
                            can be enforced. We saw in the Boer War the army of an annexed community wandering from place to place recognized as a belligerent
                            with whom Great Britain negotiated as an independent state.</p>
                        <p>A new and somewhat shadowy form of suzerainty is growing up in the <q>"paramountry"</q> first enunciated (with the concurrence of
                            Great Britain) by the President of the United States in 1823 (<ref>see MONROE DOCTRINE</ref>), asserted with a certain measure of
                            success against Great Britain in 1896 (see <ref>VENEZUELA</ref>, also <ref>ARBITRATION</ref>), and proclaimed formally by the United
                            States at the Hague peace conference in 1899 as a condition of her signature of the Peace Convention. While the Spanish republics of
                            Central and South America are recognized in international law as sovereign states, they can only be said to fulfil the conditions of
                            absolute independence subject to the limitations which the Monroe Doctrine has placed upon their treaty-making powers with Europe.
                                <note>Great Britain, in acceding to the arbitration imposed by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grover_Cleveland">President Cleveland</name>, has, in the opinion of a number of American

                            </cit> In France, where the state embraces a hierarchy of bodies and authorities culminating in the president of the republic, whose
                            acts are the final form of a series of incomplete acts of the members of the hierarchy, it comes nearer to the theoretical meaning
                            of the word. In Great Britain the sovereign power of the state is diffused among a number of authorities which have rights against
                            each other and stand in independent relation towards the individual citizens. Actions can be brought by private citizens in the
                            ordinary law courts against individual authorities, and there is no system of hierarchical responsibility which prevents a state
                            official from being personally accountable for his administrative conduct. In <ref>

                                malice or corrupt motive—endeavour to carry out the provisions of the statute, would be safe from action at the hands of a
                                shipowner. This, however, is not so. The board and its officers have more than once been sued with success. They have never been
                                accused of either malice or negligence, but the mere fact that the board acts in an administrative capacity is not a protection
                                to the board; nor is mere obedience to the orders of the board an answer to an action against its servants"</quote>

                        <p>In England, we may say, the notion of state, from the constitutional point of view, is still inchoate, but the play of international
                            intercourse seems to be gradually leading to a clearer conception of the fact that an increasing national responsibility requires a
                            corresponding increase in the power of co-ordinate state control. An instance of its absence is shown by the loose way in which the
                            British Crown has granted governing powers to chartered companies (<ref>see RAID</ref>). This uncertainty applies as much to the
                            United States as to Great Britain. In the Louisiana lynching riots, of which some Italian citizens were the victims, it was
                            contended that the United States government was not responsible, and that the responsibility fell upon the government of Louisiana
                            alone. This contention could not be pressed, and compensation was of course paid to Italy. Similar difficulties arose in connexion
                            with the Japanese school question in California. The subject is well known to have raised apprehension as to the adequacy of the
                            United States system to meet its centralized state responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Another, and, in some respects, more dangerous feature of an inchoate conception of state responsibility is the growing apart, so to
                            speak, of certain British dependencies. The British state, for international purposes, is the British Empire, for domestic purposes
                            it is the United Kingdom. Any limb of the former's huge body can have interests different from those of the United Kingdom, and
                            involve its responsibility. A significant step towards concentration of liability and control was taken by the Australian colonies
                            in the federation brought about by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitution_of_Australia">the Commonwealth Act of
                                1900</title>. Under this act, by the way, an element of confusion has been created by the application of the term <q>"state"</q>

                            states, articles 106 to 124 of the Commonwealth constitution deal with the respective positions of the Commonwealth, the original
                            states, and the new states. <ref>Article 109 in particular provides that <quote>"when a law of a state is inconsistent with the law
                                    of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be

                            have a <foreign xml:lang="de">

                            subject. In consequence of the great attention paid to the subject in Germany, her state policy has been largely the work of her
                            political writers. The result has not unnaturally tended to a system bearing some resemblance to that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the American Union</name>, with this very important difference, however, that
                            whereas in the United States the federal power is derived from the democratic forces of the individual states, in Germany it is
                            derived from their aristocratic and absolutist forces. German political thinkers, in fact, have worked out <foreign xml:lang="de">
                                <hi rend="italic">Staatsrecht</hi>
                            </foreign> as a comparative study, in which arguments in favour of absolute government
                            have received as much careful consideration as those in favour of democratic institutions, and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">the German state</name> has developed upon lines based on the best theoretical
                            arguments of these thinkers. There is, therefore, no anomaly in its practically absolutist government working out the most
                            democratic reforms as yet put into legislative form. It follows, however, that German theories are of little use in the
                            consideration of the state problems with which British and American political thinkers have to deal. Anglo-Saxon institutions are
                            following their independent development, and if the influence of foreign institutions is felt at all, it is probably that of the
                            clear logical detail and cohesion of French institutions.</p>
