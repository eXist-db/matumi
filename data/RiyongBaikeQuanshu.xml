                <p>The Shanghai yinshuguan (Commercial Press) hired many translators, who were often studying in Europe or the USA. Some of the editors of this cyclopedia possibly did have such a background.</p>
                <p>A cyclopedia with the same title was published in Japan in 1895, which was itself based on an American Work. Although not mentioned, the editors could have been aware of the Japanese predecessor. </p>
                <p>The publisher Shanghai yinshuguan was founded in 1897. Shanghai yinshuguan later became a very influential press, publishing primary and secondary education textbooks, dictionaries, as well as important magazines: 
                    "Eastern Miscellany" (東方雜誌), "Education Magazine" (教育雜誌), "The Short Story Magazine" (小說月報), "Youth Magazine" (少年雜誌), "Students' Magazine" (學生雜誌).The publishing house acted without government support, its publishing strategy was market-oriented.</p>
