          <p>,<gloss target="#ART" rend="unmarked"> a word in its most extended and most popular sense meaning everything which we distinguish from
              Nature</gloss>. Art and Nature are the two most comprehensive genera of which the human mind has formed the conception. Under the genus Nature, or
            the genus Art, we include all the phenomena of the universe. But as our conception of Nature is indeterminate and variable, so in some degree is our
            conception of Art. Nor does such ambiguity arise only because some modes of thought refer a greater number of the phenomena of the universe to the
            genus Nature, and others a greater number to the genus Art. It arises also because we do not strictly limit the one genus by the other. The range of
            the phenomena to which we point, when we say Art, is never very exactly determined by the range of the other phenomena which at the same time we
            tacitly refer to the order of Nature. Everybody understands the general meaning of a phrase like <cit>
              <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer's</name></ref>
              <quote>"Nature ne Art ne koude him not amende"</quote>
            </cit>, or <cit>
              <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Pope">Pope's</name></ref>
              <quote>"Blest with each grace of nature and of art"</quote>
            </cit>. In such phrases we intend to designate familiarly as Nature all which exists independently of our study, forethought and exertion—in other
            words, those phenomena in ourselves or the world which we do not originate but find; and we intend to designate familiarly as Art all which we do
            not find but originate—or, in other words, the phenomena which we add by study, forethought and exertion to those existing independently of us. But
            we do not use these designations consistently. Sometimes we draw an arbitrary line in the action of individuals and societies, and say, Here Nature
            ends and Art begins—such a law, such a practice, such an industry even, is natural, and such another is artificial; calling those natural which
            happen spontaneously and without much reflection, and the others artificial. But this line different observers draw at different places. Sometimes
            we adopt views which waive the distinction altogether. One such view is that wherein all phenomena are regarded as equally natural, and the idea of
            Nature is extended so as to include <quote>"all the powers existing in either the outer or the inner world, and everything which exists by means of
              those powers"</quote>. In this view Art becomes a part of Nature. It is illustrated in the familiar passage of <name type="person"

          <p>A posthumous essay of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">John Stuart Mill</name> contains a full philosophical
            exposition and defence of this mode of regarding the relations of Nature and Art. Defining Nature as above, and again as a <quote>"collective name
              for all facts, actual and possible"</quote>, that writer proceeds to say that such a definition <quote>"is evidently inapplicable to some of the
              modes in which the word is familiarly employed. For example, it entirely conflicts with the common form of speech by which Nature is opposed to
              Art, and natural to artificial. For in the sense of the word Nature which has thus been defined, and which is the true scientific sense, Art is as
              much Nature as anything else; and everything which is artificial is natural—Art has no independent powers of its own: Art is but the employment of
              the powers of Nature for an end. Phenomena produced by human agency, no less than those which, as far as we are concerned, are spontaneous, depend
              on the properties of the elementary forces, or of the elementary substances and their compounds. The united powers of the whole human race could
              not create a new property of matter in general, or of any one of its species. We can only take advantage for our purposes of the properties we
              find. A ship floats by the same laws of specific gravity and equilibrium as a tree uprooted by the wind and blown into the water. The corn which
              men raise for food grows and produces its grain by the same laws of vegetation by which the wild rose and the mountain strawberry bring forth
              their flowers and fruit. A house stands and holds together by the natural properties, the weight and cohesion of the materials which compose it. A
              steam engine works by the natural expansive force of steam, exerting a pressure upon one part of a system of arrangements, which pressure, by the
              mechanical properties of the lever, is transferred from that to another part, where it raises the weight or removes the obstacle brought into
              connexion with it. In these and all other artificial operations the office of man is, as has often been remarked, a very limited one; it consists
              of moving things into certain places. We move objects, and by doing this, bring some things into contact which were separate, or separate others
              which were in contact; and by this simple change of place, natural forces previously dormant are called into action, and produce the desired
              effect. Even the volition which designs, the intelligence which contrives, and the muscular force which executes these movements, are themselves
              powers of Nature"</quote>. Another mode of thought, in some sort complementary to the last, is based on the analogy which the operations of forces
            external to a man bear to the operations of man himself. Study, forethought and exertion are assigned to Nature, and her operations are called
            operations of Art. This view was familiar to ancient systems of philosophy, and especially to that of the Stoics. According to the report of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, Nature as conceived by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zeno_of_Citium">Zeno</name> was a fire, and at the same time a voluntary agent having the power or art of
            creating things with regularity and design (<quote>"naturam esse ignem artificiosum ad gignendum progredientem via"</quote>) . To this fire not
            merely creative force and <pb n="657"/> systematic action were ascribed, but actual personality. Nature was <quote>"non artificiosa solum, sed plane
              artifex"</quote>. <quote>"That which in the works of human art is done by hands, is done with much greater art by Nature, that is, by a fire which
              exercises an art and is the teacher of other arts"</quote>. This conception of Nature as an all-generating fire, and at the same time as a
            personal artist both teaching and including in her own activity all the human arts, on the one hand may be said, with <name type="person"
              >Polixenes</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name>, to merge Art in Nature ; but on the
            other hand it finds the essence of Nature in the resemblance of her operations to those of Art. <quote>"It is the <hi rend="italic">proprium</hi> of
              art,"</quote> according to the same system, <quote>"to create and beget,"</quote> and the reasoning proceeds —Nature creates and begets, therefore
            Nature is an artist or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demiurge">Demiurgus</name>. A kindred view is set forth by <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Browne">Sir Thomas Browne</name> in the <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religio_Medici"><hi rend="italic">Religio Medici</hi></title>, when he declares that <quote>"all things are
              artificial; for Nature is the Art of God"</quote>. But these modes of thought, according to which, on the one hand, the processes of Art are
            included among processes of Nature, or on the other the processes of Nature among the processes of Art, are exceptional. In ordinary use the two
            conceptions, each of them somewhat vague and inexact, are antithetical. Their antithesis was what <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson</name> had chiefly in his mind when he defined Art as <quote>"the power of doing
              something which is not taught by Nature or by instinct"</quote>. But this definition is insufficient, because the abstract word Art, whether used
            of all arts at once or of one at a time, is a name not only for the power of doing something, but for the exercise of the power; and not only for
            the exercise of the power, but for the rules according to which it is exercised; and not only for the rules, but for the result. Painting, for
            instance, is an art, and the word connotes not only the power to paint, but the act of painting; and not only the act, but the laws for performing
            the act rightly; and not only all these, but the-material consequences of the act or the thing painted. So of agriculture, navigation and the rest.
            Exception might also be taken to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson's</name> definition on the ground
            that it excludes all actions of instinct from the genus Art, whereas usage has in more languages than one given the name of Art to several of those
            ingenuities in the lower animals which popular theory at the same time declares to be instinctive. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</name>, for instance, speaks of boughs shaken by the wind, but not so violently as to make

              animals has no more than one art, and this one has had no first inventor among the race. Man, on the other hand, has an infinity of different arts
              which were not born with his race, and of which the glory is his own"</quote>. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samuel_Johnson">Dr Johnson</name> might reply that those properties of variety and of originality or individual
            invention, which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_le_Bovier_de_Fontenelle">Fontenelle</name> himself alleges in the
            ingenuities of man but not in those of the lower animals, are sufficient to make a generic difference, and to establish the impropriety of calling a
            honeycomb or a spider's web a work of Art. It is not our purpose to trespass on ground so debateable as that of the nature of consciousness in the
            lower animals. Enough that when we use the term Art of any action, it is because we are thinking of properties in the action from which we infer,
            whether justly or not, that the agent voluntarily and designedly puts forth skill for known ends and by regular and uniform methods. If, then, we
            were called upon to frame a general definition of Art, giving the word its widest and most comprehensive meaning, it would run thus :—<hi
              rend="italic">Every regulated operation or dexterity by which organized beings pursue ends which they know beforehand, together with the rules and
              the result of every such operation or dexterity</hi>. Here it will be well to consider very briefly the natural history of the name which has been
            given to this very comprehensive conception by the principal branches of civilized mankind. Our own word Art the English language has taken, as all
            the Romance languages of modern Europe have taken theirs, directly from the Latin. The Latin <term xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">ars</hi></term>,
            according to the prevailing opinion of philologists, proceeds from a root AR, of which the primitive signification was to put or fit things
            together, and which is to be found in a large family of Greek words. The Greek <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi></term> the name
            both for arts in the particular and art in the abstract, is by its root related both to <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">τέκ-τωυ</hi></term>
            and <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">τέκ-υου</hi></term>, and thus contains the allied ideas of making and begetting. The <term xml:lang="la"
                ><hi rend="italic">proprium</hi></term> of art in the logic of the Stoics, <quote>"to create and beget"</quote>, was strictly in accordance with
            this etymology. The Teutonic <term xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Kunst</hi></term> is formed from <hi rend="italic">können</hi>, and <hi
              rend="italic">können</hi> is developed from a primitive <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">kann</hi> philology is inclined to
            recognize a preterite form of a lost verb, of which we find the traces in <hi rend="italic">Kin-d</hi>, a child ; and the form <hi rend="italic">Ich
              kann</hi> thus meaning originally "I begot," contains the germ of the two several developments,—<hi rend="italic">können</hi>, "to be master," "to
            be able," and <hi rend="italic">kennen</hi>, "to know." We thus see that the chief Indo- European languages have with one consent extended a name
            for the most elementary exercise of a constructive or productive power, till that name has covered the whole range of the skilled and deliberate
            operations of sentient beings. In proportion as men left out of sight the idea of creation, of constructing or producing, <q>"artificiosum esse ad
              gignendum"</q>, which is the primitive half of this extended notion, and attended only to the idea of skill, of proceeding by regular and
            disciplined methods, <q>"progredi via,"</q> which is the superadded half, the whole notion Art, and the name for it, might become subject to a
            process of thought which, if analysed, would be like this:— What is done by regular and disciplined methods is Art; facts are observed and
            classified, and a systematic view of the order of the universe obtained, by regular and disciplined methods; the observing and classifying of facts,
            and obtaining a systematic view of the order of the universe, is therefore Art. To a partial extent this did unconsciously take place. Science, of
            which the essence is only in knowledge and theory, came to be spoken of as Art, of which the essence is all in practice and production. <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, notwithstanding his citation of the Stoical dictum that practice and
            production were of the essence of Art, elsewhere divides Art into two kinds—one by which things are only contemplated in the mind, another by which
            something is produced and done. (<cit>
              <quote>"Quumque artium aliud eiusmodi sit, ut tantummodo rem cernat; aliud, ut moliatur aliquid et faciat."</quote>
              <ref>-<bibl><title><hi rend="italic">Acad.</hi></title> ii. 7.</bibl></ref>
            </cit>) Of the former kind his instance is geometry; of the latter the art of playing on the lyre. Now geometry, understanding by geometry an
            acquisition of the mind, that is, a collected body of observations and deductions concerning the properties of space and magnitude, is a science and
            not an art; although there is an art of the geometer, which is the skill by which he solves any given problem in his science, and the rules of that
            skill, and his exertion in putting it forth. And so every science has its instrumental art or practical discipline; and in as far as the word Art is
            used only of the practical discipline or dexterity of the geometer, the astronomer, the logician, the grammarian, or other person whose business it
            is to collect and classify facts for contemplation, in so far the usage is just. The same justification may be extended to another usage, whereby in
            Latin, and some of its derivative languages, the name Art came to be transferred in a concrete sense to the body of rules, the written code or
            manual, which lays down the discipline and regulates the dexterity; as <hi rend="italic">ars grammatica, ars logica, ars rhetorica</hi> and the
            rest. But when the word is stretched so as to mean the sciences, as theoretical acquisitions of the mind, that meaning is illegitimate. Whether or
            not <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>, in the passage above quoted, had in his mind the science of geometry
            as a collected body of observations and deductions, it is certain that the Ciceronian phrase of the <hi rend="italic">liberal arts</hi>, the <hi
              rend="italic">ingenuous arts</hi>, both in Latin and its derivatives or translations in modern speech, has been used currently to denote the
            sciences themselves, and not merely the disciplines instrumental to them. The <hi rend="italic">trivium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
              >quadrivium</hi> (grammar, logic and rhetoric—geometry, astronomy, music and arithmetic) have been habitually called arts, when some of them have
            been named in that sense in which they mean <pb n="658"/> not arts but sciences, <q>"only contemplating things in the mind."</q> Hence the
            nomenclature, history and practical organization, especially in Britain, of one great division of university studies: the division of <q>"arts,"</q>
            with its <q>"faculty,"</q> its examinations, and its degrees. In the German language the words for Art and Science have in general been loosely
            interchanged. The etymology of the word for Art secured a long continuance for this ambiguity. <term xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic"
              >Kunst</hi></term> was employed indiscriminately in both the senses of the primitive <hi rend="italic">Ich kann</hi>, to signify what I know, or
            Science, and what I can do, or Art. It was not till the end of the 17th century that a separate word for Science, the modern <term xml:lang="de"><hi
                rend="italic">Wissenschaft</hi></term>, came into use. On the other hand, the Greek word <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic"
              >τέχυη</hi></term>, with its distinct suggestion of the root signification to make or get, acted probably as a safeguard against this tendency.
            The distinction between <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">τέχυη</hi></term>, Art or practice, and <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic"
                >έπιστήμη</hi></term>, knowledge or Science, is observed, though not systematically, in Greek philosophy. But for our present purpose, that of
            making clear the true relation between the one conception and the other, further quotation is rendered superfluous by the discussion the subject has
            received at the hands of the modern writer already quoted. Between Art, of which we practise the rules, and Science, of which we entertain the
            doctrines, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name> establishes the difference in the simplest shape,
            by pointing out that one grammatical mood is proper for the conclusions of Science, and another for those of Art. Science enunciates her conclusions
            in the indicative mood, whereas <quote>"the imperative is the characteristic of Art, as distinguished from Science."</quote> And as Art utters her
            conclusions in her own form, so she supplies the substance of her own major premise. <quote>"Every art has one first principle, or general major
              premise, not borrowed from science, that which enunciates the object aimed at, and affirms it to be a desirable object. The builder's art assumes
              that it is desirable to have buildings; architecture (as one of the fine arts) that it is desirable to have them beautiful and imposing. The
              hygienic and medical arts assume, the one that the preservation of health, the other that the cure of disease, are fitting and desirable ends.
              These are not propositions of science. Propositions of science assert a matter of fact—an existence, a co-existence, a succession, or a
              resemblance. The propositions now spoken of do not assert that anything is, but enjoin or recommend that something should be. They are a class by
              themselves. A proposition of which the predicate is expressed by the words <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> or <hi rend="italic">should be</hi> is
              generically different from one which is expressed by <hi rend="italic">is</hi> or <hi rend="italic">will be</hi>."</quote> And the logical
            relation of Art and Science, in other words, the manner of framing the intermediate member between the general major premise of Art and its
            imperative conclusion, is thus defined:— <cit>
              <quote>"The Art [in any given case] proposes to itself an end to be attained, defines the end, and hands it over to the Science. The Science
                receives it, considers it as a phenomenon or effect to be studied, and having investigated its causes and conditions, sends it back to Art with
                a theorem of the causes and combinations by which it could be produced. Art then examines these combinations of circumstances, and according as
                any of them are or are not in human power, pronounces the end attainable or not. The only one of the premises, therefore, which Art supplies, is
                the original major premise, which asserts that the attainment of the given end is desirable. Science, then, lends to Art the proposition
                (obtained by a series of inductions or deductions) that the performance of certain actions will attain the end. From these premises Art
                concludes that the performance of these actions is desirable, and finding it also practicable, converts the theorem into a rule or precept. ...
                The grounds, then, of every rule of Art are to be found in the theorems of Science. An Art, or a body of Art, consists of the rules, together
                with as much of the speculative propositions as comprises the justification of these rules. The complete Art of any matter includes a selection
                of such a portion from the Science as is necessary to show on what conditions the effects, which the Art aims at producing, depend. And Art in
                general consists of the truths of Science arranged in the most convenient order for practice, instead of the order which is most convenient for
                thought. Science groups and arranges its truths so as to enable us to take in at one view as much as possible of the general order of the
                universe. Art, though it must assume the same general laws, follows them only into such of their detailed consequences as have led to the
                formation of rules of conduct, and brings together from parts of the field of Science most remote from one another, the truths relating to the

            </cit> The whole discussion may be summed up thus. Science consists in knowing, Art consists in doing. What I must do in order to know, is Art
            subservient to Science: what I must know in order to do, is Science subservient to Art. Art, then, is defined by two broad distinctions: first, its
            popular distinction from Nature; and next, its practical and theoretic distinction from Science. Both of these distinctions are observed in the
            terms of our definition given above. Within the proper limits of this definition, the conception of Art, and the use of the word for it, have
            undergone sundry variations. These variations correspond to certain vicissitudes or developments in the order of historical facts and in society.
            The requirements of society, stimulating the ingenuity of its individual members, have led to the invention of arts and groups of arts, constantly
            progressing, with the progress of civilization, in number, in complexity, and in resource. The religious imagination of early societies, who find
            themselves in possession of such an art or group of arts, forgets the history of the invention, and assigns it to the inspiration or special grace
            of some god or hero. So the Greeks assigned the arts of agriculture to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triptolemus"
              >Triptolemus</name>, those of spinning and navigation to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ATHENA">Athena</name>, and of music
            to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo">Apollo</name>. At one stage of civilization one art or group of arts is held in
            higher esteem, another at another. In societies, like most of those of the ancient world, where slaves were employed in domestic service, and upon
            the handicrafts supplying the immediate utilities of life—food, shelter and clothing—these constituted a group of servile arts. The arts of
            husbandry or agriculture, on the other hand, have alternately been regarded as servile and as honourable according as their exercise has been in the
            hands of a subject class, as under feudal institutions, or, as under the Roman republic, of free cultivators. Under feudal institutions, or in a
            society in a state of permanent war, the allied arts of war and of government have been held the only honourable class. In commercial states, like
            the republics of Italy, the arts of gain, or of production (other than agricultural) and distribution, have made good their title to equal
            estimation and greater power beside the art of captains. But among peaceful arts, industries or trades, some have always been held to be of higher
            and others of lower rank; the higher rank being assigned to those that required larger operations, higher training, or more thoughtful conduct, and
            yielded ampler returns—the lower rank to those which called for simple manual exercise, especially if such exercise was of a disagreeable or
            degrading kind. In the cities of Italy, where both commerce and manufactures were for the first time organized on a considerable scale, the name
              <term xml:lang="it"><hi rend="italic">arte</hi></term>, Art, was retained to designate the gilds or corporations by which the several industries
            were exercised; and, according to the nature of the industry, the art was classed as higher or lower (<term xml:lang="it"><hi rend="italic"
                >maggiore</hi></term> and <term xml:lang="it"><hi rend="italic">minore</hi></term>). The arts of which we have hitherto spoken have arisen from
            positive requirements, and supply what are strictly utilities, in societies; not excluding the art of war, at least so far as concerns one-half of
            war, the defensive half. But war continued to be an honourable pursuit, because it was a pursuit associated with birth, power and wealth, as well as
            with the virtue of courage, in cases where it had no longer the plea of utility, but was purely aggressive or predatory; and the arts of the chase
            have stood in this respect in an analogous position to those of war. There are other arts which have not had their origin in positive practical
            needs, but have been practised from the first for pleasure or amusement. The most primitive human beings of whom we have any knowledge, the
            cave-dwellers of the palaeolithic period, had not only the useful art of chipping stones into spear-heads, knife-heads and arrow-heads, and making
            shafts or handles of these implements out of bone; they had also the ornamental art of scratching upon the bone handle the outlines of the animals
            they saw—mammoth, rhinoceros or reindeer—or of carving such a handle into a rude resemblance of one of these animals. Here we have a skill
            exercised, in the first case, for pure fancy or pleasure, and in the second, for adding an element of fancy or pleasure to an element of utility.
            Here, therefore, is the <pb n="659"/> germ of all those arts which produce imitations of natural objects for purposes of entertainment or delight,
            as painting, sculpture, and their subordinates; and of all those which fashion useful objects in one way rather than another because the one way
            gives pleasure and the other does not, as architecture and the subordinate decorative arts of furniture, pottery and the rest. Arts that work in a
            kindred way with different materials are those of dancing and music. Dancing works with the physical movements of human beings. Music works with
            sound. Between that imitative and plastic group, and the group of these which only produce motion or sound and pass away, there is the intermediate
            group of eloquence and the drama, which deal with the expression of human feeling in spoken words and acted gestures. There is also the
            comprehensive art of poetry, which works with the material of written words, and can ideally represent the whole material of human life and
            experience. Of all these arts the end is not use but pleasure, or pleasure before use, or at least pleasure and use conjointly. In modern language,
            there has grown up a usage which has put them into a class by themselves under the name of the Fine Arts, as distinguished from the Useful or
            Mechanical Arts. (See AESTHETICS and FINE ARTS.) Nay more, to them alone is often appropriated the use of the generic word Art, as if they and they
            only were the arts <term xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">κατ’έξοχήν</hi></term>. And further yet, custom has reduced the number which the
            class-word is meant to include. When Art and the works of Art are now currently spoken of in this sense, not even music or poetry is frequently
            denoted, but only architecture, sculpture and painting by themselves, or with their subordinate and decorative branches. In correspondence with this
            usage, another usage has removed from the class of <hi rend="italic">arts</hi>, and put into a contrasted class of <hi rend="italic"
              >manufactures</hi>, a large number of industries and their products, to which the generic term Art, according to our definition, properly applies.
            The definition covers the <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> arts, which can be efficiently exercised by mere trained habit, rote or calculation,
            just as well as the fine arts, which have to be exercised by a higher order of powers. But the word Art, becoming appropriated to the fine arts, has
            been treated as if it necessarily carried along with it, and as if works to be called works of art must necessarily possess, the attributes of free
            individual skill and invention, expressing themselves in ever new combinations of pleasurable contrivance, and seeking perfection not as a means
            towards some ulterior practical end but as an ideal end in itself.</p>

            from Asia, repudiates as fables the ordinary explanations assigned to the names Europe and Asia, but confesses his inability to say whence they
            came. It would appear probable, however, that the former of these words was derived from an <name type="place"

            which signifies the west or setting sun, and the latter from a corresponding root meaning the east or rising sun, and that they were used at one
            time to imply the west and the east. There is ground also for supposing that they may at first have been used with a specific or restricted local
            application, a more extended signification having eventually been given to them. After the word Asia had acquired its larger sense, it was still
            specially used by the Greeks to designate the country around <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephesus">Ephesus</name>. The idea
            of Asia as originally formed was necessarily indefinite, and long continued to be so; and the area to which the name was finally applied, as
            geographical knowledge increased, was to a great extent determined by arbitrary and not very precise conceptions, rather than on the basis of
            natural relations and differences subsisting between it and the surrounding regions.</p>

          <p> The northern boundary of Asia is formed by the Arctic Ocean; the coast-line falls between 700 and 75° N., and so lies within the Arctic circle,
            having its extreme northern point in Cape Sivero-Vostochnyi (i.e. north-east) or Chelyuskin, in 78° N. On the south the coast-line is far more
            irregular, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the China Sea reaching about to the northern tropic at the mouths of the Indus, of the Ganges and
            of the Canton river; <pb n="735"/> while the great peninsulas of Arabia, Hindostan and Cambodia descend to about 10° N., and the Malay peninsula
            extends within a degree and a half of the equator. On the west the extreme point of Asia is found on the shore of the Mediterranean, at Cape Baba,
            in 260 E., not far from the Dardanelles. Thence the boundary passes in the one direction through the Mediterranean, and down the Red Sea to the
            southern point of Arabia, at the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, in 450 E.; and in the other through the Black Sea, and along the range of Caucasus,
            following approximately 400 N. to the Caspian, whence it turns to the north on a line not far from the 60th meridian, along the Ural Mountains, and
            meets the Arctic Ocean nearly opposite the island of Novaya Zemlya. The most easterly point of Asia is East Cape (Vostochnyi, i.e. east, or
            Dezhnev), in 190° E., at the entrance of Bering Strait. The boundary between this point and the extremity of the Malay Peninsula follows the coast
            of the Northern Pacific and the China Sea, on a line deeply broken by the projection of the peninsulas of Kamchatka and Korea, and the recession of
            the Sea of Okhotsk, the Yellow Sea, and the Gulfs of Tongking and Siam.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Islands</hi></hi></head>
          <p>On the east and south-east of Asia are several important groups of islands, the more southern of which link this continent to Australia, and to the
            islands of the Pacific. The islands. Kurile islands, the Japanese group, Luchu, Formosa and the Philippines, may be regarded as unquestionable
            outliers of Asia. Between the islands of the Malay archipelago from Sumatra to New Guinea, and the neighbouring Asiatic continent, no definite
            relations appear ever to have existed, and no distinctly marked boundary for Asia has been established by the old geographers in this quarter.
            Modern science, however, has indicated a line of physical separation along the channel between Borneo and Celebes, called the Straits of Macassar,
            which follows approximately 120° E., to the west of which the flora and fauna are essentially Asiatic in their type, while to the south and east the
            Australian element begins to be distinctly marked, soon to become predominant. To this boundary has been given the name of <name type="place"

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Form of continent</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Owing to the great extent of Asia, it is not easy to obtain a correct conception of the actual form of its outline from ordinary maps, the
            distortions which accompany projections of Form of large spherical areas on a flat surface being necessarily great and misleading. Turning,
            therefore, to a globe, Asia viewed as a whole, will be seen to have the form of a great isosceles spherical triangle, having its north-eastern apex
            at East Cape (Vostochnyi), in Bering Strait; its two equal sides, in length about a quadrant of the sphere, or 6500 m., extending on the west to the
            southern point of Arabia, and on the east to the extremity of the Malay peninsula; and the base between these points occupying about 60° of a great
            circle, or 4500 m., and being deeply indented by the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on either side of the Indian peninsula. A great circle, drawn
            through East Cape and the southern point of Arabia, passes nearly along the coast-line of the Arctic Ocean, over the Ural Mountains, through the
            western part of the Caspian, and nearly along the boundary between Persia and Asiatic Turkey. Asia Minor and the north-western half of Arabia lie
            outside such a great circle, which otherwise indicates, with fair accuracy, the north-western boundary of Asia. In like manner a great circle drawn
            through East Cape and the extremity of the Malay peninsula, passes nearly over the coasts of Manchuria, China and Cochin-China, and departs
            comparatively little from the eastern boundary.</p>

          <p>Asia is divided laterally along the parallel of 400 north by a depression which, beginning on the east of the desert of Gobi, extends westwards
            through Mongolia to Chinese Turkestan. To the west of Kashgar the central depression is limited by the meridional range of Sarikol and the great
            elevation of the Pamir, of which the Sarikol is the eastern face. The level of this depression (once a vast inland sea) between the mountains which
            enclose the sources of the Hwang-ho and the Sarikol range probably never exceeds 2000 ft. above sea, and modern researches tend to prove that in the
            central portions of the Gobi (about Lop Nor) it may be actually below sea-level. A vast proportion of the continent north of this central line is
            but a few hundred feet in altitude. Shelving gradually upward from the low flats of Siberia the general continental level rises to a great central
            waterparting, or divide, which stretches from the Black Sea through the Elburz and the Hindu Kush to the Tian-shan mountains in the Pamir region,
            and hence to Bering Strait on the extreme north-east. This great divide is not always marked by well-defined ranges facing steeply either to the
            north or south. There are considerable spaces where the strike, or axis, of the main ranges is transverse to the water-parting, which is then
            represented by intermediate highlands forming lacustrine regions with an indefinite watershed. Only a part of this great continental divide
            (including such ranges as the Hindu Kush, Tian-shan, Altai or Khangai) rises to any great height, a considerable portion of it being below 5000 ft.
            in altitude. South of the divide the level at once drops to the central depression of Gobi, which forms a vast interior, almost waterless space,
            where the local drainage is lost in deserts or swamps. South of this enclosed depression is another great hydrographic barrier which parts it from
            the low plains of the Amur, of China, Siam and India, bordered by the shallows of the Yellow Sea and the shoals which enclose the islands of Japan
            and Formosa, all of them once an integral part of the continent. This second barrier is one of the most mighty upheavals in the world, by reason
            both of its extent and its altitude. Starting from the Amur river and reaching along the eastern margin of the Gobi desert towards the sources of
            the Hwangho, it merges into the Altyn-tagh and the Kuen-lun, forming the northern face of the vast Tibetan highlands which are bounded on the south
            by the Himalaya. The Pamir highlands between the base of the Tian-shan mountains and the eastern buttresses of the Hindu Kush unite these two great
            divides, enclosing the Gobi depression on the west; and they would again be united on the east but for the transverse valley of the Amur, which
            parts the Khingan mountains from the Yablonoi system to the east of Lake Baikal. If we consider the whole continent to be divided into three
            sections, viz. a northern section with an average altitude of less than 5000 ft. above sea, where all the main rivers flow northward to the
            Mediterranean, the Arctic Sea, or the Caspian; a central section of depression, where the drainage is lost in swamps or <hi rend="italic"
              >hamūns</hi>, and of which the average level probably does not exceed 2000 ft. above sea; and a southern section divided between highly elevated
            table-lands from 15,000 to 16,000 ft. in altitude, and lowlands of the Arabian, Indian, Siamese and Chinese peninsulas, with an ocean outlet for its
            drainage; we find that there is only one direct connexion between northern and southern sections which involves no mountain passes, and no
            formidable barrier of altitudes. That one is afforded by the narrow valley of the Hari Rud to the west of Herat. From the Caspian to Karachi it is
            possible to pass without encountering any orographic obstacle greater than the divide which separates the valley of the Hari Rud from the Helmund
              <hi rend="italic">hamūn</hi> basin, which may be represented by an altitude of about 4000 ft. above sea-level. This fact possesses great
            significance in connexion with the development of Asiatic railways.</p>

            high elevations (Lake Victoria, 13,400 ft., being probably the most elevated), and are undoubted vestiges of an ancient period of glaciation. Such
            lakes, as a rule, show indications of a gradual decrease in size, Others are relics of an earlier geological period, when land areas <pb n="736"/>

            produce effects not less marked. The changes of temperature and climate caused by difference of elevation are quite comparable in their magnitude
            and effect on all organized creatures with those due to differences of latitude; and the relative position of the high and low lands on the earth's
            surface, by modifying the direction of the winds, the fall of rain, and other atmospheric phenomena, produce effects in no sense less important than
            those due to the relative distribution of the land and sea. Hence the study of the mountain ranges of a continent is, for a proper apprehension of
            its physical conditions and characteristics, as essential as the examination of its extent and position in relation to the equator and poles, and
            the configuration of its coasts.</p>

          <p>From such causes the physical conditions of a large part of Asia, and the history of its population, have been very greatly influenced by the
            occurrence of the mass of mountain above described, which includes the Himalaya and the whole elevated area having true physical connexion with that
            range, and occupies an area about 2000 m. in length and varying from 100 to 500 m. in width, between 65º and 100° east and between 28° and 35º
            north. These mountains, which include the highest peaks in the world, rise, along their entire length, far above the line of perpetual snow, and few
            of the passes across the main ridges are at a less altitude than 15,000 or 16,000 ft. above the sea. Peaks of 20,000 ft. abound along the whole
            chain, and the points that exceed that elevation are numerous. A mountain range such as this, attaining altitudes at which vegetable life ceases,
            and the support of animal life is extremely difficult, constitutes an almost impassable barrier against the spread of all forms of living creatures.
            The mountain mass, moreover, is not less important in causing a complete separation between the atmospheric conditions on its opposite flanks, by
            reason of the extent to which it penetrates that stratum of the atmosphere which is in contact with the earth's surface and is effective in
            determining climate. The highest summits create serious obstructions to the movements of nearly three-fourths of the mass of the air resting on this
            part of the earth, and of nearly the whole of the moisture it contains ; the average height of the entire chain is such as to make it an almost
            absolute barrier to one-half of the air and three-fourths of the moisture; while the lower ranges also produce important atmospheric effects,
            one-fourth of the air and one-half of the watery vapour it carries with it lying below 9000 ft.</p>
          <p>This great mass of mountain, constituting as it does a complete natural line of division across a large part of the continent, will form a
            convenient basis from which to work, in proceeding, as will now be done, to give a general view of the principal countries contained in Asia.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="italic">Tibet.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The summit of the great mountain mass is occupied by Tibet, a country known by its inhabitants under the name of <hi rend="italic">Bod</hi> or <hi
              rend="italic">Bodyul</hi>. Tibet is a rugged table-land, narrow as compared with its length, broken up by a succession of mountain ranges, which
            follow as a rule the direction of the length of the table-land, and commonly rise into the regions of perpetual snow ; between the flanks of these
            lie valleys, closely hemmed in, usually narrow, having a very moderate inclination, but at intervals opening out into wide plains, and occupied
            either by rivers, or frequently by lakes from which there is no outflow and the waters of which are salt. The eastern termination of Tibet is in the
            line of snowy mountains which flanks China on the west, between the 27th and 35th parallels of latitude, and about 103º east. On the west the
            table-land is prolonged beyond the political limits of Tibet, though with much the same physical features, to about 70° east, beyond which it
            terminates; and the ranges which are covered with perpetual snow as far west as Samarkand, thence rapidly diminish in height, and terminate in low
            hills north of Bokhara.</p>
          <p>The mean elevation of Tibet may be taken as 15,000 ft. above the sea. The broad mountainous slope by which it is connected with the lower levels of
            Hindustan contains the ranges known as the Himalaya ; the name Kuen-lun is generally applied to the northern slope that descends to the central
            plains of the Gobi, though these mountains are not locally known under those names, Kuen-lun being apparently a Chinese designation.</p>
          <p>The extreme rigour of the climate of Tibet, which combines great cold with great drought, makes the country essentially very poor, and the chief
            portion of it little better than desert. The vegetation is everywhere most scanty, and scarcely anything deserving the name of a tree is to be found
            unless in the more sheltered spots, and then artificially planted. The population in the lower and warmer valleys live in houses, and follow
            agriculture ; in the higher regions they are nomadic shepherds, thinly scattered over a large area.</p>

          <p>China lies between the eastern flank of the Tibetan plateau and the North Pacific, having its northern and southern limits about on 40º and 20º N.
            respectively. The country, though generally broken up with mountains of moderate elevation, possesses none of very great importance apart from those
            of its western border. It is well watered, populous, and, as a rule, highly cultivated, fertile, and well wooded ; the climate is analogous to that
            of southern Europe, with hot summers, and winters everywhere cold and in the north decidedly severe.</p>

          <p>From the eastern extremity of the Tibetan mountains, between the 95th and 100th meridians, high ranges extend from about 35º N. in a southerly
            direction, which, spreading outwards as they go south, reach the sea at various points in Cochin- China, the Malay peninsula, and the east flank of
            Bengal. Between these ranges, which are probably permanently snowy to about 27° N., flow the great rivers of the Indo-Chinese peninsula, the Mekong,
            the Menam, the Salween, and the Irrawaddy, the valleys of which form the main portions of the states of Cochin- China (including Tongking and
            Cambodia), of Siam (including Laos) and of Burma. The people of Cochin-China are called Anam ; it is probably from a corruption of their name for
            the capital of Tongking, Kechao, that the Portuguese Cochin has been derived. All these countries are well watered, populous and fertile, with a
            climate very similar to that of eastern Bengal. The geography of the region in which the mountains of Cochin-China and Siam join Tibet is still
            imperfectly known, but there is no ground left for doubting that the great river of eastern Tibet, the Tsanpo, supplies the main stream of the
            Brahmaputra. The two great rivers of China, the Hwang-ho and the Yang-tsze-kiang, take their rise from the eastern face of Tibet, the former from
            the north-east angle, the latter from the south-east. The main stream of this last is called Dichu in Tibet, and its chief feeder is the
            Ya-lung-kiang, which rises not far from the Hwang-ho, and is considered the territorial boundary between China and Tibet.</p>

          <p>British India comprises approximately the area between the 95th and 70th meridians, and between the Tibetan table-land and the Indian Ocean. The
            Indian peninsula from 25º N. south- wards is a table-land, having its greatest elevation on the west, where the highest points rise to over 8000
            ft., though the ordinary altitude of the higher hills hardly exceeds 4000 ft. : the general level of the table-land lies between 3000 ft. as a
            maximum and 1000 ft.</p>
          <p>From the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra on the east to that of the Indus on the west, and intervening between the tableland of the peninsula
            and the foot of the Himalayan slope of the Tibetan plateau, lies the great plain of northern India, which rises at its highest point to about 1000
            ft., and includes altogether, with its prolongation up the valley of Assam, an area of about 500.000 sq. m., comprising the richest, the most
            populous and most civilized districts of India. The great plain extends, with an almost unbroken surface, from the most western to the most eastern
            extremity of British India, and is composed of deposits so finely comminuted, that it is no exaggeration to say that it is possible to go from the
            Bay of Bengal up the Ganges, through the Punjab, and down the Indus again to the sea, over a distance of 2000 m. and more, without finding a pebble,
            however small.</p>
          <p>The great rivers of northern India—the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Indus—all derive their waters from the Tibetan mountain mass ; and it is a
            remarkable circumstance that the northern water-parting of India should lie to the north of the Himalaya in the regions of central Tibet.</p>
          <p>The population of India is very large, some of its districts being among the most densely peopled in the world. The country is generally well
            cleared, and forests are, as a rule, found only along the flanks of the mountains, where the fall of rain is most abundant. The more open parts are
            highly cultivated, and large cities abound. The climate is generally such as to secure the population the necessaries of life without severe labour;
            the extremes of heat and drought are such as to render the land unsuitable for pasture, and the people everywhere subsist by cultivation of the soil
            or commerce, and live in settled villages or towns.</p>
          <p>The island of Ceylon is distinguished from the neighbouring parts of British India by little more than its separate administration and the
            Buddhistic religion of its population. The highest point in Ceylon rises to about 9000 ft. above the sea, and the mountain slopes are densely
            covered with forest. The lower levels are in climate and cultivation quite similar to the regions in the same latitude on the Malay peninsula.</p>
          <p>Of the islands in the Bay of Bengal the Nicobar and Andaman groups are alone worth notice. They are placed on a line joining the north end of
            Sumatra and Cape Negrais, the south-western extremity of Burma. They possibly owe their existence to the volcanic agencies which are known to extend
            from Sumatra across this part of the Indian Ocean.</p>

          <p>The portion of Asia west of British India, excluding Arabia and Syria, forms another extensive plateau covering an area as large as that of Tibet,
            though at a much lower altitude. Its southern border runs along the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Tigris, and thence westward to the north-east
            angle of the Levant; on the north the high land follows nearly 36º N. to the southern shore of the Caspian, and thence to the Black Sea and Sea of
            Marmora. Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Iran or Persia, Armenia and the provinces of Asia Minor occupy this high region, with which they are nearly
            conterminous. The eastern flank of this tableland follows a line of hills drawn a short distance from the Indus, between the mouth of that river and
            the Himalaya, about on the 72nd meridian; these hills do not generally exceed 4000 or 5000 ft. in elevation, but a few of the summits reach 10,000
            ft. or more. The southern and south-western face follows the coast closely up the Persian Gulf from the mouth of the Indus, and is formed farther
            west by the mountain scarp, which, rising in many points to 10,000 ft., flanks the Tigris and the Mesopotamian plains, and extends along Kurdistan
            and Armenia nearly to the 40th meridian ; beyond which it turns along the Taurus range, and the north - eastern angle of the Mediterranean. The
            north - eastern portion of the Afghan tableland abuts on the Himalaya and Tibet, with which it forms a continuous mass of mountain between the 71st
            and 72nd meridians, and 34° and 36º N. From the point of intersection of the 71st meridian with the 36th parallel of latitude, an unbroken range of
            mountain stretches on one side towards the north-east, up to the crest of the northern slope of the Tibetan plateau, and on the other nearly due
            west as far as the Caspian. The north-eastern portion of this range is of great altitude, and separates the headwaters of the Oxus, which run off to
            the Aral Sea, from those of the Indus and its Kabul tributary, which, uniting below Peshawar, are thence discharged southward into the Arabian Sea.
            The western part of the range, which received the name of Paropamisus Mons from the ancients, diminishes in height west of the 65th meridian and
            constitutes the northern face of the Afghan and Persian plateau, rising abruptly from the plains of the Turkoman desert, which lies between the Oxus
            and the Caspian. These mountains at some points attain a height of 10,000 or 12,000 ft. Along the south coast of the Caspian this line of elevation
            is prolonged as the Elburz range (not to be confused with t h e Elburz of the Caucasus), and has its culminating point in Demavend, which rises to
            19,400 ft. above the sea ; thence it extends to the north-west to Ararat, which rises to upwards of 17,000 ft., from the vicinity of which the
            Euphrates flows off to the south-west, across the high lands of Armenia. Below the north-east declivity of this range lies Georgia, on the other
            side of which province rises the Caucasus, the boundary of Asia and Europe between the Caspian and Black Seas, the highest points of which reach an
            elevation of nearly 19,000 ft. West of Ararat high hills extend along the Black Sea, between which and the Taurus range lies the plateau of Asia
            Minor, reaching to the Aegean Sea ; the mountains along the Black Sea, on which are the Olympus and Ida of the ancients, rise to 6000 or 7000 ft. ;
            the Taurus is more lofty, reaching 8000 and 10,000 ft. ; both ranges decline in altitude as they approach the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>This great plateau, extending from the Mediterranean to the Indus, has a length of about 2500 m. from east to west, and a breadth of upwards of 600
            m. on the west and nowhere of less than 250 m. It lies generally at altitudes between 2000 ft. and 8000 ft. above the sea-level. Viewed as a whole,
            the eastern half of this region, comprising Persia, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, is poor and unproductive. The climate is very severe in the winter
            and extremely hot in summer. The rainfall is very scanty, and running waters are hardly known, excepting among the mountains which form the scarps
            of the elevated country. The population is sparse, frequently nomadic and addicted to plunder ; progress in the arts and habits of civilization is
            small. The western part of the area falls within <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Turkish
            empire</name>. Its climate is less hot and arid, its natural productiveness much greater, and its population more settled and on the whole more

          <p>The peninsula of Arabia, with Syria, its continuation to the northwest has some of the characteristics of the hottest and driest parts of Persia
            and Baluchistan. Excepting the northern part of this tract, which is conterminous with the plain of Mesopotamia (which at its highest point reaches
            an elevation of about 700 ft. above the sea), the country is covered with low mountains, rising to 3000 or 4000 ft. in altitude, having among them
            narrow valleys in which the vegetation is scanty, with exceptional regions of greater fertility in the neighbourhood of the coasts, where the
            rainfall is greatest. In northern Syria the mountains of Lebanon rise to about 10,000 ft., and with a more copious water supply the country becomes
            more productive. The whole tract, excepting south-eastern Arabia, is nominally subject to Turkey, but the people are to no small extent practically
            independent, living a nomadic, pastoral and freebooting life under petty chiefs, in the more arid districts, but settled in towns in the more
            fertile tracts, where agriculture becomes more profitable and external commerce is established.</p>

          <p>The area between the northern border of the Persian high lands and the Caspian and Aral Seas is a nearly desert low-lying plain, extending to the
            foot of the north-western extremity of the great Tibeto-Himalayan mountains, and prolonged eastward up the valleys of the Oxus (Amu-Darya) and
            Jaxartes (Syr-Darya), and northward across the country of the Kirghiz to the south-western border of Siberia. It includes Bokhara, Khiva and
            Turkestan proper, in which the Uzbeg Turks are dominant, and for the most part is inhabited by nomadic tribes, who are marauders, enjoying the
            reputation of being the worst among a race of professed robbers. The tribes to the north, subject to Russia, are naturally more peaceable, and have
            been brought into some degree of discipline. In this tract the rainfall is nowhere sufficient for the purposes of agriculture, which is only
            possible by help of irrigation ; and the fixed population (which contains a non-Turkish element) is comparatively small, and restricted to the towns
            and the districts near the rivers.</p>
          <p>The north-western extremity of the elevated Tibeto-Himalayan mountain plateau is situated about on 73° E. and 39° N. This region is known as Pamir;

            Kamchatka to the borders of Manchuria, as far as the 135th meridian, in lat. 55º N. Thence the Yablonoi range, continuing in the same direction,

            Pacific ; the basin of this river, with its affluents, constitutes Manchuria. From the north of Manchuria the Khingan range stretches southward to
            the Chinese frontier near Peking, east of which the drainage falls into the Amur and the Yellow Sea, while to the west is an almost rainless region,
            the inclination of which is towards the central area of the continent, Mongolia.</p>

          <p>From the western end of the Yablonoi range, on the 115th meridian, a mountainous belt extends along a somewhat irregular line to the extremity of
            Pamir, known under various names in its different parts, and broken up into several branches, enclosing among them many isolated drainage areas,
            from which there is no outflow, and within which numerous lakes are formed. The most important of these ranges is the Tian-shan or Celestial
            Mountains, which form the northern boundary of the Gobi desert; they lie between 40° and 43° N., and between 75º and 95º E., and some of the summits
            are said to exceed 20,000 ft. in altitude ; along the foot of this range are the principal cultivated districts of central Asia, and here too are
            situated the few towns which have sprung up in this barren and thinly peopled region. Next may be named the Ala-tau, on the prolongation of the
            Tian-shan, flanking the Syr on the north, and rising to 14,000 or 15,000 ft. It forms the barrier between the Issyk-kul and Balkash lakes, the
            elevation of which is about 5000 ft. Last is the Altai, near the 50th parallel, rising to 10,000 or 12,000 ft., which separates the waters of the
            great rivers of western Siberia from those that collect into the lakes of northwest Mongolia, Dzungaria and Kalka. A line of elevation is continued
            west of the Altai to the Ural Mountains, not rising to considerable altitudes; this divides the drainage of south-west Siberia from the great plains
            lying north-east of the Aral Sea.</p>
          <p>The central area bounded on the north and north-west by the Yablonoi Mountains and their western extension in the Tian-shan, on the south by the
            northern face of the Tibetan plateau, and on the east by the Khingan range before alluded to, forms the great desert of central Asia, known as the
            Gobi. Its eastern part is nearly conterminous with south Mongolia, its western forms Chinese or eastern Turkestan. It appears likely that no part of
            this great central Asiatic desert is less than 2000 ft. above the sea-level. The elevation of the plain about Kashgar and Yarkand is from 4000 to
            6000 ft. The more northern parts of Mongolia are between 4000 and 6000 ft., and no portion of the route across the desert between the Chinese
            frontier and Kiakhta is below 3000 ft. The precise positions of the mountain ridges that traverse this central area are not properly known ; their
            elevation is everywhere considerable, and many points are known to exceed 10,000 or 12,000 ft.</p>
          <p>In Mongolia the population is essentially nomadic, its wealth consisting in herds of horned cattle, sheep, horses and camels. The Turki tribes,
            occupying western Mongolia, are among the least civilized of human beings, and it is chiefly to their extreme barbarity and cruelty that our
            ignorance of central Asia is due. The climate is very severe, with great extremes of heat and cold. The drought is very great; rain falls rarely and
            in small quantities. The surface is for the most part a hard stony desert, areas of blown sand occurring but exceptionally. There are few towns or
            settled villages, except <pb n="738"/> along the slopes of the higher mountains, on which the rain falls more abundantly, or the melting snow

            Siberia. It includes an immense high and broken plateau which spreads from south-west to north-east, losing in width and altitude as it advances

            is sufficient to maintain such vegetation as is compatible with the conditions of temperature, and the surface is often swampy or peaty. The
            mountain-sides are commonly clothed with pine forests, and the plains with grasses or shrubs. The population is very scanty ; the cultivated tracts
            are comparatively small in extent and restricted to the more settled districts. The towns are entirely Russian. The indigenous races are nomadic
            Mongols, of a peaceful character, but in a very backward state of civilization. The Ural Mountains do not exceed 2000 or 3000 ft. in average
            altitude, the highest summits not exceeding 6000 ft., and one of the passes being as low as 3400 ft. In the southern half of the range are the chief
            mining districts of Russia. The Ob, Yenisei and Lena, which traverse Siberia, are among the largest rivers in the world.</p>

          <p>The southern group of the Malay Archipelago, from Sumatra to Java and Timor, extends in the arc of a circle between 95º and 127º E., and from 5° to
            10° S. The central part of the group is a volcanic region, many of the volcanoes being still active, the summits frequently rising to 10,000 ft. or
            more.</p>
          <p>Sumatra, the largest of the islands, is but thinly peopled ; the greater part of the surface is covered with dense forest, the cultivated area
            being comparatively small, confined to the low lands, and chiefly in the volcanic region near the centre of the island. Java is the most thickly
            peopled, best cultivated and most advanced island of the whole Eastern archipelago. It has attained a high degree of wealth and prosperity under the
            Dutch government. The people are peaceful and industrious, and chiefly occupied with agriculture. The highest of the volcanic peaks rises to 12,000
            ft. above the sea. The eastern islands of this group are less productive and less advanced.</p>
          <p>Borneo, the most western and the largest of the northern group of islands which extends between 110° and 150° E., as far as New Guinea or Papua, is
            but little known. The population is small, rude and uncivilized ; and the surface is rough and mountainous and generally covered with forest except
            near the coast, to the alluvial lands on which settlers have been attracted from various surrounding countries. The highest mountain rises to nearly
            14,000 ft., but the ordinary elevations do not exceed 4000 or 5000 ft.</p>
          <p>Of Celebes less is known than of Borneo, which it resembles in condition and natural characteristics. The highest known peaks rise to 8000 ft.,
            some of them being volcanic.</p>

          <p>Guinea extends almost to the same meridian as the eastern coast of Australia, from the north point of which it is separated by Torres Straits. Very
            little is known of the interior. The mountains are said to rise to 20,000 ft., having the appearance of being permanently covered with snow ; the
            surface seems generally to be clothed with thick wood. The inhabitants are of the Negrito type, with curly or crisp and bushy hair ; those of the
            west coast have come more into communication with the traders of other islands and are fairly civilized. Eastward, many of the tribes are barbarous
            savages.</p>
          <p>The Philippine Islands lie between 5° and 20º N., between Borneo and southern China. The highest land does not rise to a greater height than 10,250
            ft. ; the climate is well suited for agriculture, and the islands generally are fertile and fairly cultivated, though not coming up to the standard
            of Java either in wealth or population.</p>
          <p>Formosa, which is situated under the northern tropic, near the coast of China, is traversed by a high range of mountains, reaching nearly 13,000
            ft. in elevation. On its western side, which is occupied by an immigrant Chinese population, are open and well-cultivated plains ; on the east it is
            mountainous, and occupied by independent indigenous tribes in a less advanced state.</p>
          <p>The islands of Japan, not including Sakhalin, of which half is Japanese, lie between the 30th and 45th parallels. The whole group is traversed by a
            line of volcanic mountains, some of which are in activity, the highest point being about 13,000 ft. above the sea. The country is generally well
            watered, fertile and well cultivated. The Japanese people have added to their ancient civilization and their remarkable artistic faculty, an
            adaptation of Western methods, and a capacity for progress in war and commerce, which single them out among Eastern races as a great modern
            world-force.</p>

          <p>The progress of geodetic surveys in Russia had long ago extended across the European half of the great empire, St Petersburg being connected with
            Tiflis on the southern slopes of the Caucasus by a direct system of triangulation carried out with the highest scientific precision. St Petersburg,
            again, is connected with Greenwich by European systems of triangulation; and the Greenwich meridian is adopted by Russia as the zero for all her
            longitude values. But beyond the eastern shores of the Caspian no system of direct geodetic measurement by first-class triangulation has been
            possible, and the surveys of Asiatic Russia are separated from those of Europe by the width of that inland sea. The arid nature of the trans-Caspian
            deserts has proved an insuperable obstacle to those rigorous methods of geodetic survey which distinguish Russian methods in Europe, so that Russian
            geography in central Asia is dependent on other means than that of direct measurement for the co-ordinate values in latitude and longitude for any
            given point. The astronomical observatory at Tashkent is adopted for the initial starting-point of the trans-Caspian triangulation of Russia ; the
            triangulation ranks as second-class only, and now extends to the Pamir frontier beyond Osh. The longitude of the Tashkent observatory has been
            determined by telegraph differentially with Pulkova as follows :— <table rows="4" cols="4">

          <p>Exact surveys in Russia, based upon triangulation, extend as far east as Chinese Turkestan in longitude about 75° E. of Greenwich. In India
            geodetic triangulation furnishes the basis for exact surveys as far east as the eastern boundaries of Burma in longitude about 100° E.</p>
          <p>The close of the 19th century witnessed the forging of the final links in the great geodetic triangulation of India, so far as the peninsula is
            concerned. Further geodetic connexion with the European systems remains to be accomplished. Since 1890 further and more rigorous application of the
            telegraphic method of determining longitudes differentially with Greenwich has resulted in a slight correction (amounting to about 2" of arc) to the
            previous determination by the same method through Suez. This last determination was effected through four arcs as follows :— <list>
              <item>I. Greenwich—Potsdam.</item>
              <item>II. Potsdam—Teheran.</item>
              <item>III. Teheran—Bushire.</item>
              <item>IV. Bushire—Karachi.</item>
            </list> Each arc was measured with every precaution and a multitude of observations. The only element of uncertainty was caused by the retardation
            of the current, which between Potsdam and Teheran (3000 m.) took 08-20 to travel; but it is probable that the final value can be accepted as correct
            to within 08-05.</p>
          <p>The final result of this latest determination is to place the Madras observatory 2' 27" to the west of the position adopted for it on the strength
            of absolute astronomical determinations.</p>

            of earth measurement, a topographical connexion has been effected between Russian and Indian surveys which sufficiently proves that the deductive

          <p>In connexion with the Indian triangulation minor extensions carried out on systems involving more or less irregularity have been pushed outwards on
            all sides. They reach through Afghanistan and Baluchistan to the eastern districts of Persia, and along the coast of Makran to that of Arabia. They
            have long ago included the farther mountain peaks of Nepal, and they now branch outwards towards western China and into Siam. These far extensions
            furnish the basis for a vast amount of exploratory survey of a strictly geographical character, and they have contributed largely towards raising
            the standard of accuracy in Asiatic geographical surveys to a level which was deemed unattainable fifty years ago. There is yet a vast field open in
            Asia for this class of surveys. While at the close of the 19th century western Asia (exclusive of Arabia) may be said to have been freed from all
            geographical perplexity, China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia still include enormous areas of which geographical knowledge is in a primitive stage of

            longitude, which culminates in the Altyn Tagh, and extends eastwards in a continuous water-divide to the Nan Shan mountains, north of the Koko Nor

            sea-level, forming an intermediate steppe between the highest regions and the lowest, east of Lop Nor. All this is comparatively new geography, and

            basins, and the original connexion of these seas, have also come under the close investigation of Russian scientists, with the result that the
            theory of an ancient connexion between the Oxus and the Caspian has been displaced by the more recent hypothesis of an extension of the Caspian Sea
            eastwards into Trans-Caspian territory within the post- Pleiocene age. The discovery of shells (now living in the Caspian} at a distance of about
            100 m. inland, at an altitude of 140 to 280 ft. above the present level of the Caspian, gives support to this hypothesis, which is further advanced
            by the ascertained nature of the Kara-kum sands, which appear to be a purely marine formation exhibiting no traces of fluviatile deposits which
            might be considered as delta deposits of the Oxus.</p>

            process of upheaval still in action may throw some light on the physical (especially the climatic) changes which must have passed over that part of

            Tibet and Burma from China. In this field the researches of travellers already mentioned, combined with the more exact reconnaissance of native
            surveyors and of those exploring parties which have recently been working in the interests of commercial projects, have left little to future
            inquiry. We know now for certain that the great Tsanpo of Tibet and the Brahmaputra are one and the same river; that north of the point where the
            great countermarch of that river from east to west is effected are to be found the sources of the Salween, the Mekong, the Yang-tsze-kiang and the
            Hwang-ho, or Yellow river, in order, from west to east ; and that south of it, thrust in between the extreme eastern edge of the Brahmaputra basin
              <pb n="741"/> and the Salween, rise the dual sources of the Irrawaddy. From the water-divide which separates the most eastern affluent of the
            Brahmaputra, eastwards to the deep gorges which enclose the most westerly branch of the upper Yang-tsze-kiang (here running from north to south), is
            a short space of 100 m. ; and within that space two mighty rivers, the Salween and the Mekong, send down their torrents to Burma and Siam. These
            three rivers flow parallel to each other for some 300 m., deep hidden in narrow and precipitous troughs, amidst some of the grandest scenery of Asia
            ; spreading apart where the Yang-tsze takes its course eastwards, not far north of the parallel of 25º.</p>
          <p>The comparatively restricted area which still remains for close investigation includes the most easterly sources of the Brahmaputra, the most

          <p>The advance of Russia to the Turkoman deserts and the Oxus demanded a definite boundary between her trans-Caspian conquests and the kingdom of
            Afghanistan. This was determined on the north-west by <name type="institution">the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission</name> of 1884-I886. A boundary
            was then fixed between the Hari Rud (the river of Herat) and the Oxus, which is almost entirely artificial in its construction. Zulfikar, where the
            boundary leaves the Hari Rud, is about 70 m. south of Sarakhs, and the most southerly point of the boundary (where it crosses the Kushk) is about 60
            m. north of Herat. From the junction of the boundary with the Oxus at Khamiab about 150 m. above the crossing-point of the Russian Trans-Caspian
            railway at Charjui, the main channel of the Oxus river becomes the northern boundary of Afghanistan, separating that country from Russia, and so
            continues to its source in Victoria Lake of the Great Pamir. Beyond this point <name type="institution">the Anglo-Russian Commission</name> of 1895
            demarcated a line to the snowfields and glaciers which overlook the Chinese border. Between the Russian Pamirs and Chinese Turkestan the rugged line
            of the Sarikol range intervenes, the actual dividing line being still indefinite. Beyond Kashgar the southern boundary of Siberia follows an
            irregular course to the north-east, partly defined by the Tian-shan and Alatau mountains, till it attains a northerly point in about 53° N. lat.
            marked by the Sayan range to the west of Irkutsk. It then deflects south-east till it touches the Kerulen affluent of the Amur river at a point
            which is shown in unofficial maps as about 117º 30'E. long, and 49º 20' N. lat. From here it follows this affluent to its junction with the Amur
            river, and the Amur river to its junction with the Usuri. It follows the Usuri to its head (its direction now being a little west of south), and
            finally strikes the Pacific coast on about 42º 30' N. lat. at the month of the Tumen river 100 m. south of the Amur bay, at the head of which lies
            the Russian port of Vladivostok. At two points the Russian boundary nearly approaches that of provinces which are directly under British suzerainty.
            Where the Oxus river takes its great bend to the north from Ishkashim, the breadth of the Afghan territory intervening between that river and the
            main water-divide of the Hindu Kush is not more than 10 or 12 m. ; and east of the Pamir extension of Afghanistan, where the Beyik Pass crosses the
            Sarikol range and drops into the Taghdumbash Pamir, there is but the narrow width of the Karachukar valley between the Sarikol and the Muztagh.
            Here, however, the boundary is again undefined. Eastwards of this the great Kashgar depression, which includes the Tarim desert, separates Russia
            from the vast sterile highlands of Tibet; and a continuous series of desert spaces of low elevation, marking the limits of a primeval inland sea
            from the Sarikol meridional watershed to the Khingan mountains on the western borders of Manchuria, divide her from the northern provinces of China.
            From the Khingan ranges to the Pacific, south of the Amur, stretch the rich districts of Manchuria, a province which connects Russia with the Korea
            by a series of valleys formed by the Sungari and its affluents—a land of hill and plain, forest and swamp, possessing a delightful climate, and vast
            undeveloped agricultural resources. Throughout this land of promise Russian influence was destroyed by Japan in the war of 1904. The possession of
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lüshunkou_District">Port Arthur</name>, and direct political control over Korea, place Japan
            in the dominant position as regards Manchuria.</p>

          <p>Coincident with the demarcation of Russian boundaries in Turkestan was that of northern Afghanistan. From the Hari Rud on the west to the Sarikol
            mountains on the east her northern Afghan limits were set by <name type="institution">the Boundary Commissions</name> of 1884-1886 and of 1895
            respectively. Her southern and eastern boundaries were further defined by a series of minor commissions, working on the basis of the Kabul agreement
            of 1893, which lasted for nearly four years, terminating with the Mohmand settlement at the close of an expedition in 1897.</p>
          <p>The Pamir extension of Afghan territory to the north-east reaches to a point a little short of 75° E., from whence it follows the waterdivide to
            the head of the Taghdumbash Pamir, and is thenceforward defined by the water-parting of the Hindu Kush. It leaves the Hindu Kush near the Dorah Pass
            at the head of one of the minor Chitral affluents, and passing south-west divides Kafiristan from Chitral and Bajour, separates the sections of the
            Mohmands who are within the respective spheres of Afghan and British sovereignty, and crosses the Peshawar-Kabul route at Lundi-Khana. It thus
            places a broad width of independent territory between the boundaries of British India (which have remained practically, though not absolutely,
            untouched) and Afghanistan; and this independent belt includes Swat, Bajour and a part of the Mohmand territory north of the Kabul river. The same
            principle of maintaining an intervening width of neutral territory between the two countries is definitely established throughout the eastern
            borders of Afghanistan, along the full length of which a definite boundary has been demarcated to the point where it touches the northern limits of
            Baluchistan on the Gomal river. From the Gomal Baluchistan itself becomes an intervening state between British India and Afghanistan, and the
            dividing line between Baluchistan and Afghanistan is laid down with all the precision employed on the more northerly sections of the
            demarcation.</p>

          <p>Baluchistan can no longer be regarded as a distinct entity amongst Asiatic nations, such as Afghanistan undoubtedly is. Baluchistan independence
            demands qualification. There is British Baluchistan <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi></foreign>, and there is the rest of
            Baluchistan which exists in various degrees of independence, but is everywhere subject to British control. British Baluchistan officially includes
            the districts of Peshin, Sibi and of Thal-Chotiali. As these districts had originally been Afghan, they were transferred to British authority by the
            treaty of Gandamak in 1879, although nominally they had been handed over to Kalat forty years previously. Now they form an official province of
            British Baluchistan within <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baluchistan_Agency">the Baluchistan Agency</name>; and the
            agency extends from the Gomal to the Arabian Sea and the Persian frontier. Within this agency there are districts as independent as any in
            Afghanistan, but the political status of the province as a whole is almost precisely that of the native states of the Indian peninsula. The agent to
            the governor-general of India, with a staff of political assistants, practically exercises supreme control.</p>

          <p>The increase of Russian influence on the northern Persian border and its extension southwards towards Seistan led to the appointment of a British
            consul at Kirman, the dominating town of southern Khorasan, directly connected with Meshed on the north ; and the acquisition of rights of
            administration of the Nushki district secured to Great Britain the trade between Seistan and Quetta by the new Helmund desert route.</p>

          <p>While British India has so far avoided actual geographical contact with one great European power in Asia on the north and west, she has touched
            another on the east. The Mekong river which limits British interests in Burma limits also those of France in Tongking. The eastern boundaries of
            Burma are not yet fully demarcated on the Chinese frontier. At a point level in latitude with Mogaung, near the northern termination of the Burmese
            railway system, this boundary is defined by the eastern watershed of the Nmaikha, the eastern of the two great northern affluents of the Irrawaddy.
            Then it follows an irregular course southwards to a position south-east of Bhamo in lat. 24º. It next defines the northern edge of the Shan States,
            and finally strikes the Mekong river in lat. 21º 45' (approximately). From that point southwards the river becomes the boundary between the Shan
            States and Tongking for some 200 m., the channel of the river defining the limits of occupation (though not entirely of interest) between French and
            British subjects. Approximately on the parallel of 20º N. lat. the Burmese boundary leaves the Mekong to run westwards towards the Salween, and
            thereafter following the eastern watershed of the Salween basin it divides the Lower Burma provinces from Siam.</p>

          <p>The geology of Asia is so complex and over wide areas so little known that it is difficult to give a connected account of either the structure or
            the development of the continent, and only the broader features can be dealt with here.</p>
          <p>In the south, in Syria, Arabia and the peninsula of India, none but the oldest rocks are folded, and the Upper Palaeozoic, the Mesozoic and the
            Tertiary beds lie almost horizontally upon them. It is a region of quiescence or of faulting, but not of folding. North of this lies a broad belt in
            which the Mesozoic deposits and even the lower divisions of the Tertiary system are thrown into folds which extend in a series of arcs from west to
            east and now form the principal mountain ranges of central Asia. This belt includes Asia Minor, Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, the Himalayas, the
            Tian-shan, and, although they are very different in direction, the Burmese ranges. The Kuen-lun, Nan-shan and the mountain ranges of southern China
            are, perhaps, of earlier date, but nevertheless they lie in the same belt. It is not true that throughout the whole width of this zone the beds are
            folded. There are considerable tracts which are but little disturbed, but these tracts are enclosed within the arcs formed by the folds, and the
            zone taken as a whole is distinctly one of crumpling. North of the folded belt, and including the greater part of Siberia, Mongolia and northern
            China, lies another area which is, in general, free from any important folding of Mesozoic or Tertiary age. There are, it is true, mountain ranges
            which are formed of folded beds, but in many cases the direction of the chains is different from that of the folds, so that the ranges must owe
            their elevation to other causes; and the folds, moreover, are of ancient date, for the most part Archaean or Palaeozoic. The configuration of the
            region is largely due to faulting, trough-like or tray-like depressions being formed, and the intervening strips, which have not been depressed,
            standing up as mountain ridges. Over a large part of Siberia and in the north of China, even the Cambrian beds still he as horizontally as they were
            first laid down. In the extreme north, in the Verkhoyansk range and in the mountains of the Taimyr peninsula, there are indications of another zone
            of folding of Mesozoic or later date, but our information concerning these ranges is very scanty. Besides the three chief regions into which the
            mainland is thus seen to be divided, attention should be drawn to the festoons of islands which border the eastern side of the continent, and which
            are undoubtedly due to causes similar to those which produced the folds of the folded belt.</p>
          <p>Of all the Asiatic ranges the Himalayan is, geologically, the best known ; and the evidence which it affords shows clearly that the folds to which
            it owes its elevation were produced by an overthrust <pb n="743"/> from the north. It is, indeed, as if the high land of central Asia had been
            pushed southward against and over the unyielding mass formed by the old rocks of the Indian peninsula, and in the process the edges of the
            over-riding strata had been crumpled and folded. Overlooking all smaller details, we may consider Asia to consist of a northern mass and a southern
            mass, too rigid to crumple, but not too strong to fracture, and an intermediate belt of softer rock which was capable of folding. If then by the
            contraction of the earth's interior the outer crust were forced to accommodate itself to a smaller nucleus, the central softer belt would yield by
            crumpling; the more rigid masses to the north and south, if they gave way at all, would yield by faulting. It is interesting to observe, as will be
            shown later, that during the Mesozoic era there was a land-mass in the north of Asia and another in the south, and between them lay the sea in which
            ordinary marine sediments were deposited. The belt of folding does not precisely coincide with this central sea, but the correspondence is fairly
            close.</p>
          <p>The present outline of the eastern coast and the nearly enclosed seas which lie between the islands and the mainland, are attributed by <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ferdinand_von_Richthofen">Richthofen</name> chiefly to simple faulting.</p>
          <p>Little is known of the early geological history of Asia beyond the fact that a large part of the continent was covered by the sea during the
            Cambrian and Ordovician periods. But there is positive evidence that much of the north and east of Asia has been land since the Palaeozoic era, and
            it has been conclusively proved that the peninsula of India has never been beneath the sea since the Carboniferous period at least. Between these
            ancient land masses lies an area in which marine deposits of Mesozoic age are well developed and which was evidently beneath the sea during the
            greater part of the Mesozoic era. The northern land-mass has been named <name type="place">Angaraland</name> by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">E. Suess</name> ; the southern, of which the Indian peninsula is but a fragment, is called <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name> by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melchior_Neumayr">Neumayr</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name>
            and others ; while the intervening sea is the central Mediterranean sea of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melchior_Neumayr"
              >Neumayr</name> and <name type="place">the Tethys</name> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Suess">Suess</name>. The
            greater part of western Asia, including the basin of the Obi, the drainage area of the Aral Sea, together with Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Persia and
            Arabia, was covered by the sea during the later stages of the Cretaceous period ; but a considerable part of this region was probably dry land in
            Jurassic times.</p>
          <p>The northern land-mass begins in the north with the area which lies between the Yenisei and the Lena. Here the folded Archean rocks are overlaid by
            Cambrian and Ordovician beds, which still lie for the most part flat and undisturbed. Upon these rest patches of freshwater deposits containing
            numerous remains of plants. They consist chiefly of sandstone and conglomerate, but include workable seams of coal. Some of the deposits appear to
            be of Permian age, but others are probably Jurassic ; and they are all included under the general name of the Angara series. Excepting in the
            extreme north, where marine Jurassic and Cretaceous fossils have been found, there is no evidence that this part of Siberia has been beneath the sea
            since the early part of the Palaeozoic era. Besides the plant beds extensive outflows of basic lava rest directly upon the Cambrian and Ordovician
            strata. The date of these eruptions is still uncertain, but they probably continued to a very recent period.</p>
          <p>South and east of the Palaeozoic plateau is an extensive area consisting chiefly of Archean rocks, and including the greater part of Mongolia north
            of the Tian-shan. Here again there are no marine beds of Mesozoic or Tertiary age, while plant-bearing deposits belonging to the Angara series are
            known. Structurally, the folds of this region are of ancient date ; but the area is crossed by a series of depressions formed by faults, and the
            intervening strips, which have not been depressed to the same extent, now stand up as mountain ranges. Farther south, in the Chinese provinces of
            Shansi and Shensi, the geological succession is similar in some respects to that of the Siberian Palaeozoic plateau, but the sequence is more
            complete. There is again a floor of folded Archean rocks overlaid by nearly horizontal strata of Lower Palaeozoic age; but these are followed by
            marine beds belonging to the Carboniferous period. From the Upper Carboniferous onward, however, no marine deposits are known; and, as in Siberia,
            plant-bearing beds are met with. Southern China is very different in structure, consisting largely of folded mountain chains, but the geological
            succession is very similar, and excepting near the Tibetan and Burmese borders, there are no marine deposits of Mesozoic or Tertiary age.</p>
          <p>Thus it appears that from the Arctic Ocean there stretches a broad area as far as the south of China, in which no marine deposits of later date
            than Carboniferous have yet been found, except in the extreme north. Freshwater and terrestrial deposits of Mesozoic age occur in many places, and
            the conclusion is irresistible that the greater part of this area has been land since the close of the Palaeozoic era. The Triassic deposits of the
            Verkhoyansk Range show that this land did not extend to the Bering Sea ; while the marine Mesozoic deposits of Japan on the east, the western
            Tian-shan on the west and Tibet on the south give us some idea of its limits in other directions.</p>
          <p>In the same way the entire absence of any marine fossils in the peninsula of India, excepting near its borders, and the presence of the terrestrial
            and freshwater deposits of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwana</name> series, representing the whole of the
            geological scale from the top of the Carboniferous to the top of the Jurassic, show that this region also has been land since the Carboniferous
            period. It was a portion of a great land-mass which probably extended across the Indian Ocean and was at one time united with the south of
            Africa.</p>
          <p>But these two land-masses were not connected. Between India and China there is a broad belt in which marine deposits of Mesozoic and Tertiary age
            are well developed. Marine Tertiary beds occur in Burma ; in the Himalayas and in south Tibet there is a nearly complete series of marine deposits
            from the Carboniferous to the Eocene ; in Afghanistan the Mesozoic beds are in part marine and in part fluviatile. The sea in which these strata
            were deposited seems to have attained its greatest extension in Upper Cretaceous times, when its waters spread over the whole of western Asia and
            even encroached slightly upon the Indian land. The Eocene sea, however, cannot have been much inferior in extent.</p>
          <p>It was after the Eocene period that the main part of the elevation of the Himalayas took place, as is shown by the occurrence of nummulitic
            limestone at a height of 20,000 ft. The formation of this and of the other great mountain chains of central Asia resulted in the isolation of
            portions of the former central sea ; and the same forces finally led to the elevation of the whole region and the union of the old continents of
              <name type="place">Angara</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwana</name>. <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name>, however, did not long survive, and the portion which lay between India and South
            Africa sank beneath the waves in Tertiary times.</p>
          <p>Leaving out of consideration all evidence of more ancient volcanic activity, each of the three regions, into which, as we have seen, the continent
            may be divided, has been, during or since the Cretaceous period, the seat of great volcanic eruptions. In the southern region of unfolded beds are
            found the lavas of the <q>" harras "</q> of Arabia, and in India the extensive flows of the Deccan Trap. In the central folded belt lie the great
            volcanoes, now mostly extinct, of Asia Minor, Armenia, Persia and Baluchistan. In Burma also there is at least one extinct volcano. In the northern
            unfolded region great flows of basic lava lie directly upon the Cambrian and Ordovician beds of Siberia, but are certainly in part of Tertiary age.
            Similar flows on a smaller scale occur in Manchuria, Korea and northern China. In all these cases, however, the eruptions have now almost ceased;
            and the great volcanoes of the present day lie in the islands off the eastern and south-eastern coasts.</p>

          <p>Among the places on the globe where the temperature falls lowest are some in northern Asia, and among those where it rises highest are some in
            southern Asia. The mean temperature of the north coast of eastern Siberia is but a few degrees above the zero of Fahrenheit; the lowest mean
            temperature anywhere observed is about 4º Fahr., at Melville Island, north of the American continent. The isothermals of mean annual temperature lie
            over northern Asia on curves tolerably regular in their outline, having their western branches in a somewhat higher latitude than their eastern ; a
            reduction of 1° of latitude corresponds approximately—and irrespective of modifications due to elevation —to a rise of 1/2° Fahr., as far say as 30º
            N., where the mean temperature is about 75° Fahr. Farther south the increase is slower, and the highest mean temperature anywhere attained in
            southern Asia is not much above 82° Fahr.</p>
          <p>The variations of temperature are very great in Siberia, amounting near the coast to more than 100° Fahr., between the mean of the hottest and
            coldest months, and to still more between the extreme temperatures of those months. In southern Asia, and particularly near the sea, the variation
            between the hottest and coldest monthly means is very much less, and under the equator it is reduced to about 5º. In Siberia the difference between
            the means of the hottest and coldest months is hardly anywhere less than 60° Fahr. On the Sea of Aral it is 80° Fahr. ; and at Astrakhan, on the
            Caspian, more than 50°. At Tiflis it is 45º. In northern China, at Peking, it is 55°, reduced to 30° at Canton, and to 20º at Manila. In northern
            India the greatest difference does not exceed 40°; and it falls off to about 15° at Calcutta, and to about 10° or 12° at Bombay and Madras. The
            temperatures at the head of the Persian Gulf approximate to those of northern India, and those of Aden to Madras. At Singapore the range is less
            than 5°; and at Batavia in Java, and Galle in Ceylon, it is about the same. The extreme temperatures in Siberia may be considered to lie between 80°
            and 90º Fahr. for maxima, and between -40º and -70° Fahr. for minima. The extreme of heat near the Caspian and Aral Seas rises to nearly 100° Fahr.,
            while that of cold falls to -20º Fahr. or lower. Compared with these figures, we find in southern Asia 110º or 112° Fahr. as a maximum hardly ever
            exceeded. The absolute minimum in northern India, in lat. 30º, hardly goes below 32° ; at Calcutta it is about 40º, though the thermometer seldom
            falls to 50°. At Madras it rarely falls as low as 65°, or at Bombay below 60°. At Singapore and Batavia the thermometer very rarely falls below 70°,
            or rises above 90º. At Aden the minimum is a few degrees below 70°, the maximum not much exceeding 90º.</p>
          <pb n="744"/>
          <p>These figures sufficiently indicate the main characteristics of the air temperatures of Asia. Throughout its northern portion the winter is long
            and of extreme severity ; and even down to the circle of 35° N. lat., the minimum temperature is almost as low as zero of Fahrenheit. The summers
            are hot, though short in the northern latitudes, the maximum of summer heat being comparatively little less than that observed in the tropical
            countries farther south. The moderating effect of the proximity of the ocean is felt in an important degree along the southern and eastern parts of
            Asia, where the land is broken up into islands or peninsulas. The great elevations above the sea-level of the central part of Asia, and of the
            table-lands of Afghanistan and Persia, tend to exaggerate the winter cold ; while the sterility of the surface, due to the small rainfall over the
            same region, operates powerfully in the opposite direction in increasing the summer heat. In the summer a great accumulation of solar heat takes
            place on the dry surface soil, from which it cannot be released upwards by evaporation, as might be the case were the soil moist or covered with
            vegetation, nor can it be readily conveyed away downwards as happens on the ocean. In the winter similar consequences ensue, in a negative
            direction, from the prolonged loss of heat by radiation in the long and clear nights—an effect which is intensified wherever the surface is covered
            with snow, or the air little charged with vapour. In illustration of the very slow diffusion of heat in the solid crust of the earth, and as
            affording a further indication of the climate of northern Asia, reference may here be made to the frozen soil of Siberia, in the vicinity of
            Yakutsk. In this region the earth is frozen permanently to a depth of more than 380 ft. at which the temperature is still 5º or 6° Fahr. below the
            freezing point of water, the summer heat merely thawing the surface to a depth of about 3 ft. At a depth of 50 ft. the temperature is about 15º
            Fahr. below the freezing point. Under such conditions of the soil, the land, nevertheless, produces crops of wheat and other grain from fifteen to
            forty fold.</p>
          <p>The very high summer temperatures of the area north of the tropic of Cancer are sufficiently accounted for, when compared with those observed south
            of the tropic, by the increased length of the day in the higher latitude, which more than compensates for the loss of heat due to the smaller
            mid-day altitude of the sun. The difference between the heating power of the sun's rays at noon on the 21st of June, in latitude 20º and in latitude
            45°, is only about 2 % ; while the accumulated heat received during the day, which is lengthened to 15 1/2 hours in the higher latitude, is greater
            by about 11 % than in the lower latitude, where the day consists only of 13 1/4 hours.</p>
          <p>Although the foregoing account of the temperatures of Asia supplies the main outline of the observed phenomena, a very important modifying cause,
            of which more will be said hereafter, comes into operation over the whole of the tropical region, namely, the periodical summer rains. These tend
            very greatly to arrest the increase of the summer heat over the area where they prevail, and otherwise give it altogether peculiar
            characteristics.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Pressure and Winds.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The great summer heat, by expanding the air upwards, disturbs the level of the planes of equal pressure, and causes an outflow of the upper strata
            from the heated area. The winter cold produces an effect of just an opposite nature, and causes an accumulation of air over the cold area. The
            diminution of barometric pressure which takes place all over Asia during the summer months, and the increase in the winter, are hence, no doubt, the
            results of the alternate heating and cooling of the air over the continent.</p>
          <p>The necessary and immediate results of such periodical changes of pressure are winds, which, speaking generally, blow from the area of greatest to
            that of least pressure—subject, however, to certain modifications of direction, arising from the absolute motion of the whole body of the air due to
            the revolution of the earth on its axis from west to east. The south-westerly winds which prevail north of the equator during the hot half of the
            year, to which navigators have given the name of the south-west monsoon (the latter word being a corruption of the Indian name for season), arise
            from the great diminution of atmospheric pressure over Asia, which begins to be strongly marked with the great rise of temperature in April and May,
            and the simultaneous relatively higher pressure over the equator and the regions south of it. This diminution of pressure, which continues as the
            heat increases till it reaches its maximum in July soon after the solstice, is followed by the corresponding development of the south-west monsoon;
            and as the barometric pressure is gradually restored, and becomes equalized within the tropics soon after the equinox in October, with the general
            fall of temperature north of the equator, the south-west winds fall off, and are succeeded by a north-east monsoon, which is developed during the
            winter months by the relatively greater atmospheric pressure which then occurs over Asia, as compared with the equatorial region.</p>
          <p>Although the succession of the periodical winds follows the progress of the seasons as just described, the changes in the wind's direction
            everywhere take place under the operation of special local influences which often disguise the more general law, and make it difficult to trace.
            Thus the south-west monsoon begins in the Arabian Sea with west and north-westerly winds, which draw round as the year advances to south-west and
            fall back again in the autumn by northwest to north. In the Bay of Bengal the strength of the southwest monsoon is rather from the south and
            south-east, being succeeded by north-east winds after October, which give place to northerly and north-westerly winds as the year advances. Among
            the islands of the Malay Archipelago the force of the monsoons is much interrupted, and the position of this region on the equator otherwise
            modifies the directions of the prevailing winds. The southerly summer winds of the Asiatic seas between the equator and the tropic do not extend to
            the coasts of Java, and the southeasterly trade winds are there developed in the usual manner. The China Sea is fully exposed to both monsoons, the
            normal directions of which nearly coincide with the centre of the channel between the continent of Asia and the eastern islands.</p>
          <p>The south-west monsoon does not generally extend, in its character of a south-west wind, over the land. The current of air flowing in from over the
            sea is gradually diverted towards the area of least pressure, and at the same time is dissipated and loses much of its original force. The winds
            which pass northward over India blow as south-easterly and easterly winds over the north-eastern part of the Gangetic plain, and as south winds up
            the Indus. They seem almost entirely to have exhausted their northward velocity by the time they have reached the northern extremity of the great
            Indian plain ; they are not felt on the table-lands of Afghanistan, and hardly penetrate into the Indus basin or the ranges of the Himalaya, by
            which mountains, and those which branch off from them into the Malay peninsula, they are prevented from continuing their progress in the direction
            originally imparted to them.</p>
          <p>Among the more remarkable phenomena of the hotter seas of Asia must be noticed the revolving storms or cyclones, which are of frequent occurrence
            in the hot months in the Indian Ocean and China Sea, in which last they are known under the name of typhoon. The cyclones of the Bay of Bengal
            appear to originate over the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and are commonly propagated in a north-westward direction, striking the east coast of the
            Indian peninsula at various points, and then often advancing with an easterly tendency over the land, and passing with extreme violence across the
            delta of the Ganges. They occur in all the hot months, from June to October, and more rarely in November, and appear to be originated by adverse
            currents from the north meeting those of the south-west monsoon. The cyclones of the China Sea also occur in the hot months of the year, but they
            advance from north-east to south-west, though occasionally from east to west; they originate near the island of Formosa, and extend to about the
            10th degree of N. lat. They are thus developed in nearly the same latitudes and in the same months as those of the Indian Sea, though their progress
            is in a different direction. In both cases, however, the storms appear to advance towards the area of greatest heat. In these storms the wind
            invariably circulates from north by west through south to east.</p>

        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rainfall.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The heated body of air carried from the Indian Ocean over southern Asia by the south-west monsoon comes up highly charged with watery vapour, and
            hence in a condition to release a large body of water as rain upon the land, whenever it is brought into circumstances which reduce its temperature
            in a notable degree. Such a reduction of temperature is brought about along the greater part of the coasts of India and of the Burmo- Siamese
            peninsula by the interruption of the wind current by continuous ranges of mountains, which force the mass of air to rise over them, whereby the air
            being rarefied, its specific capacity for heat is increased and its temperature falls, with a corresponding condensation of the vapour originally
            held in suspension.</p>
          <p>This explanation of the principal efficient cause of the summer rains of south Asia is immediately based on an analysis of the complicated
            phenomena actually observed, and it serves to account for many apparent anomalies. The heaviest falls of rain occur along lines of mountain of some
            extent directly facing the vapour-bearing winds, as on the Western Ghats of India and the west coast of the Malay peninsula. The same results are
            found along the mountains at a distance from the sea, the heaviest rainfall known to occur anywhere in the world (not less than 600 in. in the year)
            being recorded on the Khasi range about 100 m. north-east of Calcutta, which presents an abrupt front to the progress of the moist winds flowing up
            from the Bay of Bengal. The cessation of the rains on the southern border of Baluchistan, west of Karachi, obviously arises from the projection of
            the south-east coast of Arabia, which limits the breadth of the south-west monsoon air current and the length of the coast-line directly exposed to
            it. The very small and irregular rainfall in Sind and along the Indus is to be accounted for by the want of any obstacle in the path of the vapour -
            bearing winds, which, therefore, carry the uncondensed rain up to the Punjab, where it falls on the outer ranges of the western Himalaya and of
            Afghanistan.</p>
          <p>The diurnal mountain winds are very strongly marked on the Himalaya, where they probably are the most active agents in determining the
            precipitation of rain along the chain—the monsoon currents, as before stated, not penetrating among the mountains. The formation of dense banks of
            cloud in the afternoon, when the up wind is strongest, along the southern face of the snowy ranges of the Himalaya, is a regular daily phenomenon
            during the hotter months of the year, and heavy rain, accompanied by electrical discharges, is the frequent result of such condensation.</p>
          <p>Too little is known of the greater part of Asia to admit of any more being said with reference to this part of the subject, than to <pb n="745"/>
            mention a few facts bearing on the rainfall. In northern Asia there is a generally equal rainfall of 19 to 29 in. between the Volga and the Lena in
            Manchuria and northern China, rather more considerable increase in Korea, Siam and Japan. At Tiflis the yearly fall is 22 in.; on the Caspian about
            7 or 8 in.; on the Sea of Aral 5 or 6 in. In south-western Siberia it is 12 or 14 in., diminishing as we proceed eastward to 6 or 7 in. at Barnaul,
            and to 5 or 6 in. at Urga in northern Mongolia. In eastern Siberia it is about 15 to 20 in. In China we find about 23 in. to be the fall at Peking ;
            while at Canton, which lies nearly on the northern tropic and the region of the south-west monsoon is entered, the quantity is increased to 78 in.
            At Batavia in Java the fall is about 78 in. ; at Singapore it is nearly 100 in. The quantity increases considerably on that part of the coast of the
            Malay peninsula which is not sheltered from the south-west by Sumatra. On the Tenasserim and Burmese coast falls of more than 200 in. are
            registered, and the quantity is here nowhere less than 75 or 80 in., which is about the average of the eastern part of the delta of the Ganges,
            Calcutta standing at about 64 in. On the hills that flank Bengal on the east the fall is very great. On the Khasi hills, at an elevation of about
            4500 ft., the average of ten years is more than 550 in. As much as 150 in. has been measured in one month, and 610 in. in one year. On the west
            coast of the Indian peninsula the fall at the sea-level varies from about 75 to 100 in., and at certain elevations on the mountains more than 250
            in. is commonly registered, with intermediate quantities at intervening localities. On the east coast the fall is far less, nowhere rising to 50
            in., and towards the southern apex of the peninsula being reduced to 25 or 30 in. Ceylon shows from 60 to 80 in. As we recede from the coast the
            fall diminishes, till it is reduced to about 25 or 30 in. at the head of the Gangetic plain. The tract along the Indus to within 60 or 80 m. of the
            Himalaya is almost rainless, 6 or 8 in. being the fall in the southern portion of the Punjab. On the outer ranges of the Himalaya the yearly fall
            amounts to about 200 in. on the east in Sikkim, and gradually diminishes on the west, where north of the Punjab it is about 70 or 80 in. In the
            interior of the chain the rain is far less, and the quantity of precipitation is so small in Tibet that it can be hardly measured. It is to the
            greatly reduced fall of snow on the northern faces of the highest ranges of the Himalaya that is to be attributed the higher level of the snow-line,
            a phenomenon which was long a cause of discussion.</p>
          <p>In Afghanistan, Persia, Asia Minor and Syria, winter and spring appear to be the chief seasons of condensation. In other parts of Asia the
            principal part of the rain falls between May and September, that is, in the hottest half of the year. In the islands under the equator the heaviest
            fall is between October and February.</p>

          <p>The general assemblage of animals and plants found over northern Asia resembles greatly that found in the parts of Europe which are adjacent and
            have a similar climate. Siberia, north of the 50th parallel, has a climate not much differing from a similarly situated portion of Europe, though
            the winters are more severe and the summers hotter. The rainfall, though moderate, is still sufficient to maintain the supply of water in the great
            rivers that traverse the country to the Arctic Sea, and to support an abundant vegetation. A similar affinity exists between the life of the
            southern parts of Europe and that in the zone of Asia extending from the Mediterranean across to the Himalaya and northern China. This belt, which
            embraces Asia Minor, northern Persia, Afghanistan, and the southern slopes of the Himalaya, from its elevation has a temperate climate, and
            throughout it the rainfall is sufficient to maintain a vigorous vegetation, while the summers, though hot, and the winters, though severe, are not
            extreme. The plants and animals along it are found to have a marked similarity of character to those of south Europe, with which region the zone is
            virtually continuous.</p>
          <p>The extremely dry and hot tracts which constitute an almost unbroken desert from Arabia, through south Persia and Baluchistan, to Sind, are
            characterized by considerable uniformity in the types of life, which closely approach to those of the neighbouring hot and dry regions of Africa.
            The region of the heavy periodical summer rains and high temperature, which comprises India, the Indo- Chinese peninsula, and southern China, as
            well as the western part of the Malay Archipelago, is also marked by much similarity in the plants and animals throughout its extent. The area
            between the southern border of Siberia and the margin of the temperate alpine zone of the Himalaya and north China, comprising what are commonly
            called central Asia, Turkestan, Mongolia and western Manchuria, is an almost rainless region, having winters of extreme severity and summers of
            intense heat. Its animals and plants have a special character suited to the peculiar climatal conditions, more closely allied to those of the
            adjacent northern Siberian tract than of the other bordering regions. The south-eastern parts of the Malay Archipelago have much in common with the
            Australian continent, to which they adjoin, though their affinities are chiefly Indian. North China and Japan also have many forms of life in
            common. Much still remains to be done in the exploration of China and eastern Asia; but it is known that many of the special forms of this region
            extend to the Himalaya, while others clearly indicate a connexion with North America.</p>
          <p>The foregoing brief review of the principal territorial divisions according to which the forms of life are distributed in Asia, indicates how close
            is the dependence of this distribution on climatic conditions, and this will be made more apparent by a somewhat fuller account of the main features
            of the flora and fauna.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic">Flora.</hi></head>
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Northern Asia.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>—The flora of the whole of northern Asia is in essentials the same as that of northern Europe, the differences being due rather to variations of
            species than of genera. The absence of the oak and of all heaths east of the Ural may be noticed. Pines, larch, birch are the principal trees on the
            mountains; willow, alders and poplars on the lower ground. The northern limit of the pine in Siberia is about 70º N.</p>
          <p>Along the warm temperate zone, from the Mediterranean to the Himalaya, extends a flora essentially European in character. Many European species
            reach the central Himalaya, though few are known in its eastern parts. The genera common to the Himalaya and Europe are much more abundant, and
            extend throughout the chain, and to all elevations. There is also a corresponding diffusion of Japanese and Chinese forms along this zone, these
            being most numerous in the eastern Himalaya, and less frequent in the west.</p>
          <p>The truly tropical flora of the hotter and wetter regions of eastern India is continuous with that of the Malayan peninsula and islands, and
            extends along the lower ranges of the Himalaya, gradually becoming less marked and rising to lower elevations as we go westward, where the rainfall
            diminishes and the winter cold increases.</p>
          <p>The vegetation of the higher and therefore cooler and less rainy ranges of the Himalaya has greater uniformity of character along the whole chain,
            and a closer general approach to European forms is maintained; an increased number of species is actually identical, among these being found, at the
            greatest elevations, many alpine plants believed to be identical with species of the north Arctic regions. On reaching the Tibetan plateau, with the
            increased dryness the flora assumes many features of the Siberian type. Many true Siberian species are found, and more Siberian genera. Some of the
            Siberian forms, thus brought into proximity with the Indian flora, extend to the rainy parts of the mountains, and even to the plains of upper
            India. Assemblages of marine plants form another remarkable feature of Tibet, these being frequently met with growing at elevations of 14,000 to
            15,000 ft. above the sea, more especially in the vicinity of the many salt lakes of those regions.</p>
          <p>The vegetation of the hot and dry region of the south-west of the continent consists largely of plants which are diffused over Africa, Baluchistan
            and Sind ; many of these extend into the hotter parts of India, and not a few common Egyptian plants are to be met with in the Indian peninsula.</p>

          <p>The whole number of species of plants indigenous in the region of south-eastern Asia, which includes India and the Malayan peninsula and islands,
            from about the 65th to the 105th meridian, was estimated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Dalton_Hooker">Sir J.D.
              Hooker</name> at 12,000 to 15,000. The principal orders, arranged according to their numerical importance, are as follows :—Leguminosae,
            Rubiaceae, Orchidaceae, Compositae, Gramineae, Euphorbiaceae, Acanthaceae, Cyperaceae and Labiatae. But within this region there is a very great
            variation between the vegetation of the more humid and the more arid regions, while the characteristics of the flora on the higher mountain ranges
            differ wholly from those of the plains. In short, we have a somewhat heterogeneous assemblage of tropical, temperate and alpine plants, as has been
            already briefly indicated, of which, however, the tropical are so far dominant as to give their character to the flora viewed as a whole. The Indian
            flora contains a more general and complete illustration of almost all the chief natural families of all parts of the world than any other country.
            Compositae are comparatively rare ; so also Gramineae and Cyperaceae are in some places deficient, and Labiatae, Leguminosae and ferns in others.
            Euphorbiaceae and Scrophulariaceae and Orchidaceae are universally present, the last in specially large proportions.</p>
          <p>The perennially humid regions of the Malayan peninsula and western portion of the archipelago are everywhere covered with dense forest, rendered
            difficult to traverse by the thorny cane, a palm of the genus <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Calamus</hi></foreign>, which has its
            greatest development in this part of Asia. The chief trees belong to the orders of Terebinthaceae, Sapindaceae, Meliaceae, Clusiaceae,
            Dipterocarpaceae, Ternstroemiaceae, Leguminosae, laurels, oaks and figs, with Dilleniaceae, Sapotaceae and nutmegs. Bamboos and palms, with <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pandanus</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Dracaena</hi></foreign>, are also abundant. A
            similar forest flora extends along the mountains of eastern India to the Himalaya, where it ascends to elevations varying from 6000 to 7000 ft. on
            the east to 3000 or 4000 ft. on the west.</p>
          <p>The arboreous forms which least require the humid and equable heat of the more truly tropical and equatorial climates, and are best able to resist
            the high temperatures and excessive drought of the northern Indian hot months from April to June, are certain Leguminosae, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                ><hi rend="italic">Bauhinia</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi

                >Bignonia</hi></foreign>, a few bamboos and palms, with others which extend far beyond the tropic, and give a tropical aspect to the forest to
            the extreme northern border of the Indian plain.</p>
          <p>Of the herbaceous vegetation of the more rainy regions may be noted the Orchidaceae, Orontiaceae, Scitamineae, with ferns and other <pb n="746"/>
            Cryptogams, besides Gramineae and Cyperaceae. Among these some forms, as among the trees, extend much beyond the tropic and ascend into the
            temperate zones on the mountains, of which may be mentioned <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Begonia</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"
                ><hi rend="italic">Osbeckia</hi></foreign>, various Cyrtandraceae, Scitamineae, and a few epiphytical orchids.</p>
          <p>Of the orders most largely developed in south India, and more sparingly elsewhere, may be named Aurantiaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, Balsaminaceae,
            Ebenaceae, Jasmineae, and Cyrtandraceae ; but of these few contain as many as 100 peculiar Indian species. <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Nepenthes</hi></foreign> may be mentioned as a genus specially developed in the Malayan area, and extending from New Caledonia to Madagascar;
            it is found as far north as the Khasi hills, and in Ceylon, but does not appear on the Himalaya or in the peninsula of India. The Balsaminaceae may
            be named as being rare in the eastern region and very abundant in the peninsula. A distinct connexion between the flora of the peninsula and Ceylon
            and that of eastern tropical Africa is observable not only in the great similarity of many of the more truly tropical forms, and the identity of
            families and genera found in both regions, but in a more remarkable manner in the likeness of the mountain flora of this part of Africa to that of
            the peninsula, in which several species occur believed to be identical with Abyssinian forms. This connexion is further established by the absence
            from both areas of oaks, conifers and cycads, which, as regards the first two families, is a remarkable feature of the flora of the peninsula and
            Ceylon, as the mountains rise to elevations in which both of them are abundant to the north and east. With these facts it has to be noticed that
            many of the principal forms of the eastern flora are absent or comparatively rare in the peninsula and Ceylon.</p>
          <p>The general physiognomy of the Indian flora is mainly determined by the conditions of humidity of climate. The impenetrable shady forests of the
            Malay peninsula and eastern Bengal, of the west coast of the Indian peninsula, and of Ceylon, offer a strong contrast to the more loosely timbered
            districts of the drier regions of central India and the north-western Himalaya. The forest areas of India include the dense vegetation and luxuriant
            growth of the Tarai jungles at the foot of the eastern Himalaya, and wide stretches of loosely timbered country which are a prevailing feature in
            the Central Provinces and parts of Madras. Where the lowlands are highly cultivated they are adorned with planted wood, and where they are cut off
            from rain they are nearly completely desert.</p>
          <p>The higher mountains rise abruptly from the plains ; on their slopes, clothed below almost exclusively with the more tropical forms, a vegetation
            of a warm temperate character, chiefly evergreen, soon begins to prevail, comprising Magnoliaceae, Ternstroemiaceae, subtropical Rosaceae,
            rhododendron, oak, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Ilex</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Symplocos</hi></foreign>,
            Lauraceae, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pinus longifolia</hi></foreign>, with mountain forms of truly tropical orders, palms, <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pandanus</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Musa</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Vitis</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Vernonia</hi></foreign>, and many others. On the east the
            vegetation of the Himalaya is most abundant and varied. The forest extends, with great luxuriance, to an elevation of 12,000 ft., above which the
            sub-alpine region may be said to begin, in which rhododendron scrub often covers the ground up to 13,000 or 14,000 ft. Only one pine is found below
            8000 ft., above which several other Coniferae occur. Plantains, tree-ferns, bamboos, several <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >Calami</hi></foreign>, and other palms, and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pandanus</hi></foreign>, are abundant at the lower levels.
            Between 4000 and 8000 ft. epiphytal orchids are very frequent, and reach even to 10,000 ft. Vegetation ascends on the drier and less snowy mountain
            slopes of Tibet to above 18,000 ft. On the west, with the drier climate, the forest is less luxuriant and dense, and the hill-sides and the valleys
            better cultivated. The warm mountain slopes are covered with <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pinus longifolia</hi></foreign>, or with oaks
            and rhododendron, and the forest is not commonly dense below 8000 ft., excepting in some of the more secluded valleys at a low elevation. From 8000
            to 12,000 ft., a thick forest of deciduous trees is almost universal, above which a sub-alpine region is reached, and vegetation as on the east
            continues up to 18,000 ft. or more. The more tropical forms of the east, such as the tree-ferns, do not reach west of Nepal. The cedar or deodar is
            hardly indigenous east of the sources of the Ganges, and at about the same point the forms of the west begin to be more abundant, increasing in
            number as we advance towards Afghanistan.</p>
          <p>The cultivated plants of the Indian region include wheat, barley, rice and maize; various millets, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Sorghum</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Penicillaria</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Panicum</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Eleusine</hi></foreign> ; many pulses, peas and beans ; mustard and rape;
            ginger and turmeric ; pepper and capsicum ; several Cucurbitaceae ; tobacco, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Sesamum</hi></foreign>, poppy,
              <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Crotolaria</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Cannabis</hi></foreign> ; cotton,
            indigo and sugar ; coffee and tea ; oranges, lemons of many sorts ; pomegranate, mango, figs, peaches, vines and plantains. The more common palms
            are <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Cocos</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Phoenix</hi></foreign> and <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Borassus</hi></foreign>, supplying cocoa-nut and toddy. Indian agriculture combines the harvests of the tropical
            and temperate zones. North of the tropic the winter cold is sufficient to admit of the cultivation of almost all the cereals and vegetables of
            Europe, wheat being sown in November and reaped early in April. In this same region the summer heat and rain provide a thoroughly tropical climate,
            in which rice and other tropical cereals are freely raised, being as a rule sown early in July and reaped in September or October. In southern
            India, and the other parts of Asia and of the islands having a similar climate, the difference of the winter and summer half-years is not sufficient
            to admit of the proper cultivation of wheat or barley. The other cereals may be seen occasionally, where artificial irrigation is practised, in all
            stages of progress at all seasons of the year, though the operations of agriculture are, as a general rule, limited to the rainy months, when alone
            is the requisite supply of water commonly forthcoming.</p>
          <p>The trees of India producing economically useful timber are comparatively few, owing to the want of durability of the wood, in the extremely hot
            and moist climate. The teak, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Tectona grandis</hi></foreign>, supplies the finest timber. It is found in
            greatest perfection in the forests of the west coasts of Burma and the Indian peninsula, where the rainfall is heaviest, growing to a height of 100
            or 150 ft., mixed with other trees and bamboos. The sal, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Shorea robusta</hi></foreign>, a very durable
            wood, is most abundant along the skirts of the Himalaya from Assam to the Punjab, and is found in central India, to which the teak also extends. The
            sal grows to a large size, and is more gregarious than the teak. Of other useful woods found in the plains may be named the babool, <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi></foreign>; toon, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Cedrela</hi></foreign>; and sissoo, <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Dalbergia</hi></foreign>. The only timber in ordinary use obtained from the Himalaya proper is the deodar,
              <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Cedrus deodara</hi></foreign>. Besides these are the sandalwood, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Santalum</hi></foreign>, of southern India, and many sorts of bamboo found in all parts of the country. The cinchona has recently been
            introduced with complete success; and the mahogany of America reaches a large size, and gives promise of being grown for use as timber.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Western Asia.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The flora of the rainless region of south-western Asia is continuous with the desert flora of northern and eastern Africa, and extends from the
            coast of Senegal to the meridian of 75º E., or from the great African desert to the border of the rainless tract along the Indus and the southern
            parts of the Punjab. It includes the peninsula of Arabia, the shores of the Persian Gulf, south Persia, and Afghanistan and Baluchistan. On the west
            its limit is in the Cape Verde Islands, and it is partially represented in Abyssinia.</p>
          <p>The more common plants in the most characteristic part of this region in southern Arabia are Capparidaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and a few Leguminosae, a
              <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Reseda</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Dipterygium</hi></foreign>; palms,
            Polygonaceae, ferns, and other cryptogams, are rare. The number of families relative to the area is very small, and the number of genera and species
            equally restricted, in very many cases a single species being the only representative of an order. The aspect of the vegetation is very peculiar,
            and is commonly determined by the predominance of some four or five species, the rest being either local or sparingly scattered over the area. The
            absence of the ordinary bright green colours of vegetation is another peculiarity of this flora, almost all the plants having glaucous or whitened
            stems. Foliage is reduced to a minimum, the moisture of the plant being stored up in massive or fleshy stems against the long-continued drought.
            Aridity has favoured the production of spines as a defence from external attack, sharp thorns are frequent, and asperities of various sorts
            predominate. Many species produce gums and resins, their stems being encrusted with the exudations, and pungency and aromatic odour is an almost
            universal quality of the plants of desert regions.</p>
          <p>The cultivated plants of Arabia are much the same as those Of northern India—wheat, barley, and the common <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Sorghum</hi></foreign>, with dates and lemons, cotton and indigo. To these must be added coffee, which is restricted to the slopes of the
            western hills. Among the more mountainous regions of the south-western part of Arabia, known as Arabia Felix, the summits of which rise to 6000 or
            7000 ft., the rainfall is sufficient to develop a more luxuriant vegetation, and the valleys have a flora like that of similarly situated parts of
            southern Persia, and the less elevated parts of Afghanistan and Baluchistan, partaking of the characters of that of the hotter Mediterranean region.
            In these countries aromatic shrubs are abundant. Trees are rare, and almost restricted to <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >Pistacia</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Celtis</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Dodonaea</hi></foreign>, with poplars, and the date palm. Prickly forms of <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Statice</hi></foreign> and
              <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Astragalus</hi></foreign> cover the dry hills. In the spring there is an abundant herbaceous vegetation,
            including many bulbous plants, with genera, if not species, identical with those of the Syrian region, some of which extend to the Himalaya.</p>
          <p>The flora of the northern part of Afghanistan approximates to that of the contiguous western Himalaya. <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Quercus Ilex</hi></foreign>, the evergreen oak of southern Europe, is found in forests as far east as the Sutlej, accompanied with other
            European forms. In the higher parts Of Afghanistan and Persia Boraginaceae and thistles abound ; gigantic Umbelliferae, such as <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Ferula</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Galbanum</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"

            districts, and some of them extend into Tibet.</p>
          <p>The flora of Asia Minor and northern Persia differs but little from that of the southern parts of Europe. The mountains are clothed, where the fall
            of rain is abundant, with forests of <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Quercus</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Fagus</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Ulmus</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"

              >Corylus</hi></foreign>, and various Coniferae. Of these the only genus that is not found on the Himalaya is <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Fagus</hi></foreign>. Fruit trees of the plum tribe abound. The cultivated plants are those of southern Europe.</p>

          <p>The vegetation of the Malayan Islands is for the most part that of the wetter and hotter region of India ; but the greater uniformity of the
            temperature and humidity leads to the predominance of certain tropical forms not so conspicuous in India, while the proximity of the Australian
            continent has permitted the partial diffusion of Australian types which are not seen in India. The liquidambar and nutmeg may be noticed among <pb
              n="747"/> the former; the first is one of the most conspicuous trees in Java, on the mountains of the eastern part of which the casuarina, one of
            the characteristic forms of Australia, is also abundant. Rhododendrons occur in Borneo and Sumatra, descending to the level of the sea. On the
            mountains of Java there appears to be no truly alpine flora ; <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Saxifraga</hi></foreign> is not found. In
            Borneo some of the temperate forms of Australia appear on the higher mountains. On the other islands similar characteristics are to be observed,
            Australian genera extending to the Philippines, and even to southern China.</p>
          <p>The analysis of the Hong Kong flora indicates that about three-fifths of the species are common to the Indian region, and nearly all the remainder
            are either Chinese or local forms. The number of species common to southern China, Japan and northern Asia is small. The cultivated plants of China
            are, with a few exceptions, the same as those of India. South China, therefore, seems, botanically, hardly distinct from the great Indian region,
            into which many Chinese forms penetrate, as before noticed. The flora of north China, which is akin to that of Japan, shows manifest relation to
            that of the neighbouring American continent, from which many temperate forms extend, reaching to the Himalaya, almost as far as Kashmir. Very little
            is known of the plants of the interior of northern China, but it seems probable that a complete botanical connexion is established between it and
            the temperate region of the Himalaya.</p>

          <p>—The zoological provinces of Asia correspond very closely with the botanical. The northern portion of Asia, as far south as the Himalaya, is not
            zoologically distinct from Europe, and these two areas, with the strip of Africa north of the Atlas, constitute the Palaearctic region of <name

            the general approval of naturalists. The south-eastern portion of Asia, with the adjacent islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo and the Philippines, form
            his Indian region. The extreme south-west part of the continent constitutes a separate zoological district, comprising Arabia, Palestine and
            southern Persia, and reaching, like the hot desert botanical tract, to Baluchistan and Sind ; it belongs to what <name type="person"

          <p>Nearly all the mammals of Europe also occur in northern Asia, where, however, the Palaearctic fauna is enriched by numerous additional species. The
            characteristic groups belong mostly to forms which are restricted to cold and temperate regions. Consequently the Quadrumana, or monkeys, are nearly
            unrepresented, a single species occurring in Japan, and one or two others in northern China and Tibet. Insectivorous bats are numerous, but the
            frugivorous division of this order is only represented by a single species in Japan. Carnivora are also numerous, particularly the frequenters of
            cold climates, such as bears, weasels, wolves and foxes. Of the Insectivora numerous forms of moles, shrews and hedgehogs prevail. The Rodents are
            also well represented by various squirrels, mice and hares. Characteristic forms of this order in northern Asia are the marmots <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Arctomys)</hi></foreign> and the pikas, or tailless hares <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >(Lagomys)</hi></foreign>. The great order of Ungulata is represented by various forms of sheep, as many as ten or twelve wild species of <foreign

            of antelope, such as the saiga <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Saiga tatarica)</hi></foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Gazella gutturosa</hi></foreign>, or yellow sheep. Coming to the deer, we also meet with characteristic forms in northern Asia,

                ><hi rend="italic">(Moschus)</hi></foreign> is also quite restricted to northern Asia, and is one of its most peculiar types.</p>
          <p>The ornithology of northern Asia is even more closely allied to that of Europe than the mammal fauna. Nearly three-fourths of the well-known
            species of Europe extend through Siberia into the islands of the Japanese empire. Here again we have an absence of all tropical forms, and a great
            development of groups characteristic of cold and temperate regions. One of the most peculiar of these is the genus <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Phasianus</hi></foreign>, of which splendid birds all the species are restricted in their wild state to northern Asia. The still
            more magnificently clad gold pheasants <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Thaumalea)</hi></foreign>, and the eared pheasants <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Crossoptilon)</hi></foreign>, are also confined to certain districts in the mountains of north-eastern Asia.
            Amongst the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi></foreign>, such forms as the larks, stone-chats, finches, linnets and grosbeaks
            are well developed, and exhibit many species.</p>
          <p>The mammal fauna of the Indian region of Asia is much more highly developed than that of the Palaearctic. The Quadrumana are represented by several
            peculiar genera, amongst which are <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Hylobates</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Simia</hi></foreign>. Two peculiar forms of the Lemurine group are also
            met with. Both the insectivorous and frugivorous divisions of the bats are well represented. Amongst the Insectivora very peculiar forms are found,
            such as <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Gymnura</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Tupaia</hi></foreign>. Tho
            Carnivora are likewise numerous ; and this region may be considered as the true home of the tiger, though this animal has wandered far north into
            the Palaearctic division of Asia. Other characteristic Carnivora are civets, various ichneumons, and the benturong <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">(Arctictis)</hi></foreign>. Two species of bears are likewise restricted to the Indian region. In the order of Rodents squirrels
            are very numerous, and porcupines of two genera are met with. The Indian region is the home of the Indian elephant—one of the two sole remaining
            representatives of the order Proboscidea. Of the Ungulates, four species of rhinoceros and one of tapir are met with, besides several peculiar forms
            of the swine family. The Bovidae, or hollow-horned ruminants, are represented by several genera of antelopes, and by species of true <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Bos</hi></foreign>— such as <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">B. sondaicus</hi></foreign>, <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">B. frontalis</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">B. bubalus</hi></foreign>. Deer are
            likewise numerous, and the peculiar group of chevrotains <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Tragulus)</hi></foreign> is characteristic of the
            Indian region. Finally, this region affords us representatives of the order Edentata, in the shape of several species of <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Manis</hi></foreign>, or scaly ant-eater.</p>
          <p>The assemblage of birds of the Indian region is one of the richest and most varied in the world, being surpassed only by that of tropical America.
            Nearly every order, except that of the Struthiones or ostriches, is well represented, and there are many peculiar genera not found elsewhere, such
            as <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Buceros</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Harpactes</hi></foreign>, <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Lophophorus</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Euplocamus</hi></foreign>, <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pavo</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Ceriornis</hi></foreign>. The <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Phasianidae</hi></foreign> (exclusive of true <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Phasianus</hi></foreign>)
            are highly characteristic of this region, as are likewise certain genera of barbets <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >(Megalaema)</hi></foreign>, parrots <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Palaeornis)</hi></foreign>, and crows (<foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Dendrocitta</hi></foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Urocissa</hi></foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Cissa</hi></foreign>). The family <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Eurylaemidae</hi></foreign> is entirely confined to
            this part of Asia.</p>
          <p>The Ethiopian fauna plays but a subordinate part in Asia, intruding only into the south-western corner, and occupying the desert districts of
            Arabia and Syria, although some of the characteristic species reach still farther into Persia and Sind, and even into western India. The lion and
            the hunting-leopard, which may be considered as, in this epoch at least, Ethiopian types, extend thus far, besides various species of jerboa and
            other desert-loving forms.</p>
          <p>In the birds, the Ethiopian type is shown by the prevalence of larks and stone-chats, and by the complete absence of the many peculiar genera of
            the Indian region.</p>
          <p>The occurrence of mammals of the Marsupial order in the Molucca Islands and Celebes, while none have been found in the adjacent islands of Java and
            Borneo, lying on the west of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wallace_Line">Wallace's line</name>, or in the Indian region, shows
            that the margin of the Australian region has here been reached. The same conclusion is indicated by the absence from the Moluccas and Celebes of
            various other Mammals, Quadrumana, Carnivora, Insectivora and Ruminants, which abound in the western part of the Archipelago. Deer do not extend
            into New Guinea, in which island the genus <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Sus</hi></foreign> appears to have its eastern limit. A peculiar
            form of baboon, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Cynopithecus</hi></foreign>, and the singular ruminant, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Anoa</hi></foreign>, found in Celebes, seem to have no relation to Asiatic animals, and rather to be allied to those in
            Africa.</p>
          <p>The birds of these islands present similar peculiarities. Those of the Indian region abruptly disappear at, and many Australian forms reach but do
            not pass, the line above spoken of. Species of birds akin to those of Africa also occur in Celebes.</p>
          <p>Of the marine orders of Sirenia and Cetacea the Dugong, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Halicore</hi></foreign>, is exclusively found in
            the Indian Ocean ; and a dolphin, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Platanista</hi></foreign>, peculiar to the Ganges, ascends that river to
            a great distance from the sea.</p>

          <p>Of the sea fishes of Asia, among the Acanthopterygii, or spiny-rayed fishes, the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Percidae</hi></foreign>,
            or perches, are largely represented ; the genus <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Serranus</hi></foreign>, which has only one species in
            Europe, is very numerous in Asia, and the forms are very large. Other allied genera are abundant, and extend from the Indian seas to eastern Africa.
            The Squamipennes, or scaly-finned fishes, are principally found in the seas of southern Asia, and especially near coral reefs. The <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Mullidae</hi></foreign>, or red mullets, are largely represented by genera differing from those of Europe. The
              <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Polynemidae</hi></foreign>, which range from the Atlantic through the Indian Ocean to the Pacific, supply
            animals from which isinglass is prepared ; one of them, the mango-fish, esteemed a great delicacy, inhabits the seas from the Bay of Bengal to Siam.
            The <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Sciaenidae</hi></foreign> extend from the Bay of Bengal to China, but are not known to the westward.
            The <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Stromateidae</hi></foreign>, or pomfrets, resemble the dory, a Mediterranean form, and extend to China
            and the Pacific. The sword fishes, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Xiphiidae</hi></foreign>, the lancet fishes, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Acanthuridae</hi></foreign>, and the scabbard fishes, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Trichuridae</hi></foreign>, are
            distributed through the seas of south Asia. Mackerels of various genera abound, as well as gobies, blennies and mullets.</p>
          <p>Among the Anacanthini, the cod family so well known in Europe shows but one or two species in the seas of south Asia, though the soles and allied
            fishes are numerous along the coasts. Of the Physostomi, the siluroids are abundant in the estuaries and muddy waters ; the habits of some of these
            fishes are remarkable, such as that of the males carrying the ova in their mouths till the young are hatched. The small family of <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Scopelidae</hi></foreign> affords the gelatinous <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Harpodon</hi></foreign>,
            or bumalo. The gar-fish and flying-fishes are numerous, extending into the seas of Europe. The <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Clupeidae</hi></foreign>, or herrings, are most abundant; and anchovies, or sardines, are found in shoals, but at irregular and uncertain
            intervals. The marine eels, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Muraenidae</hi></foreign>, are more numerous towards the Malay Archipelago than
            in the Indian <pb n="748"/> seas. Forms of sea-horses <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Hippocampus)</hi></foreign>, pipe-fishes <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Syngnathus)</hi></foreign>, fife-fishes <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">(Sclerodermus)</hi></foreign>,
            and sun-fish, globe-fish, and other allied forms of <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Gymnodontes</hi></foreign>, are not uncommon.</p>
          <p>Of the cartilaginous fishes, Chondropterygii, the true sharks and hammer-headed sharks, are numerous. The dog-fish also is found, one species
            extending from the Indian seas to the Cape of Good Hope. The saw-fishes, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Pristidae</hi></foreign>, the
            electrical rays, <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Torpedinae</hi></foreign>, and ordinary rays and skates, are also found in considerable
            numbers.</p>
          <p>The fresh waters of southern Asia are deficient in the typical forms of the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
            >Acanthopterygii</hi></foreign>, and are chiefly inhabited by carp, siluroids, simple or spined eels, and the walking and climbing fishes. The
              <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Siluridae</hi></foreign> attain their chief development in tropical regions. Only one <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Silurus</hi></foreign> is found in Europe, and the same species extends to southern Asia and Africa. The <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Salmonidae</hi></foreign> are entirely absent from the waters of southern Asia, though they exist in the rivers
            that flow into the Arctic Ocean and the neighbouring parts of the northern Pacific, extending perhaps to Formosa; and trout, though unknown in
            Indian rivers, are found beyond the watershed of the Indus, in the streams flowing into the Caspian. The <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >Cyprinidae</hi></foreign>, or carp, are largely represented in southern Asia, and there grow to a size unknown in Europe ; a <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Barbus</hi></foreign> in the Tigris has been taken of the weight of 300 ft. The chief development of this family,
            both as to size and number of forms, is in the mountain regions with a temperate climate ; the smaller species are found in the hotter regions and
            in the low-lying rivers. Of the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Clupeidae</hi></foreign>, or herrings, numerous forms occur in Asiatic
            waters, ascending the rivers many hundred miles ; one of the best-known of Indian fishes, the hilsa, is of this family. The sturgeons, which abound
            in the Black Sea and Caspian, and ascend the rivers that fall into them, are also found in Asiatic Russia, and an allied form extends to southern
            China. The walking or climbing fishes, which are peculiar to south-eastern Asia and Africa, are organized so as to be able to breathe when out of
            the water, and they are thus fitted to exist under conditions which would be fatal to other fishes, being suited to live in the regions of
            periodical drought and rain in which they are found.</p>

          <p>The insects of all southern Asia, including India south of the Himalaya, China, Siam and the Malayan Islands, belong to one group ; not only the
            genera, but even the species are often the same on the opposite sides of the Bay of Bengal. The connexion with Africa is marked by the occurrence of
            many genera common to Africa and India, and confined to those two regions, and similarities of form are not uncommon there in cases in which the
            genera are not peculiar. Of Coleopterous insects known to inhabit east Siberia, nearly one-third are found in western Europe. The European forms
            seem to extend to about 30° N., south of which the Indo-Malayan types are met with, Japan being of the Europeo-Asiatic group. The northern forms
            extend generally along the south coast of the Mediterranean up to the border of the great desert, and from the Levant to the Caspian.</p>

          <p>Of the domesticated animals of Asia may first be mentioned the elephant. It does not breed in captivity, and is not found wild west of the Jumna
            river in northern India. The horse is produceed in the highest perfection in Arabia and the hot and dry countries of western Asia. Ponies are most
            esteemed from the wetter regions of the east, and the hilly tracts. Asses are abundant in most places, and two wild species occur. The horned cattle
            include the humped oxen and buffaloes of India, and the yak of Tibet. A hybrid between the yak and Indian cattle, called zo, is commonly reared in
            Tibet and the Himalaya. Sheep abound in the more temperate regions, and goats are universally met with ; both of these animals are used as beasts of
            burden in the mountains of Tibet. The reindeer of northern Siberia call also for special notice; they are used for the saddle as well as for
            draught.</p>

          <p>Asia, including its outlying islands, has become the dwelling-place of all the great families into which the races of men have been divided. By far
            the largest area is occupied by the Mongolian group. These have yellow-brown skins, black eyes and hair, flat noses and oblique eyes. They are short
            in stature, with little hair on the body and face. In general terms they extend, with modifications of character probably due to admixture with
            other types and to varying conditions of life, over the whole of northern Asia as far south as the plains bordering the Caspian Sea, including Tibet
            and China, and also over the Indo- Malayan peninsula and Archipelago, excepting Papua and some of the more eastern islands.</p>
          <p>Next in numerical importance to the Mongolians are the races which have been called by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Professor Huxley</name><foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Melanochroic</hi></foreign>
            and <foreign rend="italic">Xanthochroic</foreign>. The former includes the dark-haired people of southern Europe, and extends over North Africa,
            Asia Minor, Syria to south-western Asia, and through Arabia and Persia to India. The latter race includes the fair-haired people of northern Europe,
            and extends over nearly the same area as the Melanochroi, with which race it is greatly intermixed. The Xanthochroi have fair skins, blue eyes and
            light hair ; the others have dark skins, eyes and hair, and are of a slighter frame. Together they constitute what were once called the Caucasian
            races. The Melanochroi are not considered by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Huxley</name> to be one of
            the primitive modifications of mankind, but rather to be the result of the admixture of the Xanthochroi with the Australoid type, next to be
            mentioned.</p>
          <p>The third group is that of the Australoid type. Their hair is dark, generally soft, never woolly. The eyes and skin are dark, the beard often well
            developed, the nose broad and flat, the lips coarse, and jaws heavy. This race is believed to form the basis of the people of the Indian peninsula,
            and of some of the hill tribes of central India, to whom the name Dravidian has been given, and by its admixture with the Melanochroic group to have
            given rise to the ordinary population of the Indian provinces. It is also probable that the Australoid family extends into south Arabia and
            Egypt.</p>
          <p>The last group, the Negroid, is represented by the races to which has been given the name of Negrito, from the small size of some of them. They are
            closely akin to the negroes of South Africa, and possess the characteristic dark skins, woolly but scanty beard and body hair, broad flat noses, and
            projecting lips of the African; and are diffused over the Andaman Islands, a part of the Malay peninsula, the Philippines, Papua, and some of the
            neighbouring islands. The Negritos appear to be derived from a mixture of the true Negro with the Australoid type.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Mongolians.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The distribution of the Mongolian group in Asia offers no particular difficulty. There is complete present, and probably previous long-existing,
            geographical continuity in the area over „ which they are found. There is also considerable similarity of climate and other conditions throughout
            the northern half of Asia which they occupy. The extension of modified forms of the Mongolian type over the whole American continent may be
            mentioned as a remarkable circumstance connected with this branch of the human race.</p>
          <p>The Mongolians of the northern half of Asia are almost entirely nomadic, hunters and shepherds or herdsmen. The least advanced of these, but far
            the most peaceful, are those that occupy Siberia. Farther south the best-known tribes are <name type="people"

            their language is spoken over a large part of western Asia. Their letters are those of Persia. <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchu">The Manchus</name> and <name type="people">the Mongols</name> are chiefly Buddhist, with letters derived

            into Europe, have produced very remarkable results in the history of the world.</p>
          <p>The Chinese branch of the Mongolian family are a thoroughly settled people of agriculturists and traders. They are partially Buddhist, and have a
            peculiar monosyllabic, uninflected language, with writing consisting of symbols, which represent words, not letters.</p>
          <p>The countries lying between India and the Mongolian are occupied by populations chiefly of the Mongolian and <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">Chinese</name> type, having languages fundamentally monosyllabic, but using letters derived from
            India, and adopting their religion, which is almost everywhere Buddhist, from <name type="person">the Indians</name>. Of these may be named <name

              type="people">Shans</name>, etc.—belong (as indeed do <name type="people">the Burmese</name> themselves), and that a cognate race occupies the
            Himalaya to the eastern limits of Kashmir.</p>
          <p>Some light has been thrown on the connexion between the Tibetan race and certain tribes of central India, <name type="people"

            seems more probable that these tribes are the remnants of a Mongolian race which first displaced a yet earlier Negroid population, and was then
            itself shouldered out by a Caucasian irruption, than that they entered India by any of the northern passages within historic times. Mongolian

            by their very different climate, and by the maritime life forced upon them by the physical conditions of the region they inhabit. As they are now
            known to us, they have undergone a process of partial civilization, first at the hands of the Brahminical Indians, from whom they borrowed a
            religion, and to some extent literature and an alphabet, and subsequently from intercourse with the Arabs, which has led to the adoption of
            Mahommedanism by most of them.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Aryans.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The name of Aryan has been given to the races speaking languages derived from, or akin to, the ancient form of Sanskrit, who now occupy the
            temperate zone extending from the Mediterranean, across the highlands of Asia Minor, Persia and Afghanistan, to <pb n="749"/> India. The races
            speaking the languages akin to the ancient Assyrian, which are now mainly represented by Arabic, have been called Semitic, and occupy the countries
            south-west of Persia, including Syria and Arabia, besides extending into North Africa. Though the languages of these races are very different they
            cannot be regarded as physically distinct, and they are both without doubt branches of the Melanochroi, modified by admixture with the neighbouring
            races, the Mongols, the Australoids and the Xanthochroi.</p>
          <p>The Aryans of India are probably the most settled and civilized of all Asiatic races. This type is found in its purest form in the north and
            north-west, while the mixed races and the population referred to the Australoid type predominate in the peninsula and southern India. The spoken
            languages of northern India are very various, differing one from another in the sort of degree that English differs from German, though all are
            thoroughly Sanskritic in their vocables, but with an absence of Sanskrit grammar that has given rise to considerable discussion. The languages of
            the south are Dravidian, not Sanskritic. The letters of both classes of languages, which also vary considerably, are all modifications of the
            ancient Pali, and probably derived from the Dravidians, not from the Aryans. They are written from left to right, exception being made of Urdu or
            Hindostani, the mixed language of the Mahommedan conquerors of northern India, the character used for writing which is the Persian. From the river
            Sutlej and the borders of the Sind desert, as far as Burma and to Ceylon, the religion of the great bulk of the people of India is Hindu or
            Brahminical, though the Mahommedans are often numerous, and in some places even in a majority. West of the Sutlej the population of Asia may be said
            to be wholly Mahommedan, with the exception of certain relatively small areas in Asia Minor and Syria, where Christians predominate. The language of
            the Punjab does not differ very materially from that of Upper India. West of the Indus the dialects approach more to Persian, which language meets
            Arabic and Turki west of the Tigris, and along the Turkoman desert and the Caspian. Through the whole of this tract the letters are used which are
            common to Persian, Arabic and Turkish, written from right to left.</p>

          <p>Considerable progress has been made in the classification of the various races which occupy the continent to the west of the great Mongolian

            Afghanistan and Badakshan, and their language (in the central districts of Asia) is found to contain words of Aryan or Sanskrit derivation which are
            not known in Persian. They have been for the most part dispossessed of their country by Turkish immigration and conquests, but they still retain
            their original intellectual superiority over <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turkish</name> and other mixed

            dwelling in Dzungaria, migrated to Siberia, and settled on the Lower Volga. From thence they returned late in the 18th century to the reoccupation

          <p>The result of trans-border surveys to the north and west of India has been to establish the important geographical fact that it is by two gateways
            only, one on the north-west and one on the west of India, that the central Asiatic tides of immigration have flowed into the peninsula. The Kabul
            valley indicates the north-western entrance, and Makran indicates that on the west. By the Kabul valley route, which includes at its head the group
            of passes across the Hindu Kush which extend from the Khawak to the Kaoshan, all those central Asian hordes, be they <name type="people"

            or <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, who were driven towards the rich plains of the south, entered the Punjab.
            Some of them migrated from districts which belong to eastern Asia, but none of them penetrated into India by eastern passes. Such tides as set
            towards the Himalaya broke against their farther buttresses, leaving an interesting ethnographical flotsam in the northern valleys ; but they never
            overflowed the Himalayan barrier. Later most of the historic invasions of India from central Asia followed tho route which leads directly from Kabul
            to Peshawar and Delhi.</p>
          <p>By the western gates of Makran prehistoric irruptions from Mesopotamia broke into the plains of Lower Sind, and either passed on towards the
            central provinces of India or were absorbed in the highlands south of Kalat. In later centuries <name type="people">the Arabs</name> from the west
            reached the valley of the Indus by their western route, and there established a dynasty which lasted for 300 years. The identification of existing
            peoples with the various Scythic, Persian and Arab races who have passed from High Asia into the Indian borderland, has opened up a vast field of
            ethnographical inquiry which has hardly yet found adequate workers for its investigation. To such fields may be added the yet more complicated
            problems of those reflex waves which flowed backwards from India into the border highlands.</p>

              >Asia Minor</name> has been connected with the opposite shores of Europe rather than with the lands lying to the east. A juster view of early

          <p>2. The words <q>" Asiatic "</q> and <q>" Oriental "</q> are often used as if they denoted a definite and homogeneous type, but <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians">Russians</name> resemble Asiatics in many ways, and <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, <name type="people">Hindus</name>, <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">Chinese</name>, etc., differ in so many important points that the common substratum is small. It
            amounts to this, that Asiatics stand on a higher level than the natives of Africa or America, but do not possess the special material civilization
            of western Europe. As far as any common mental characteristic can be assigned it is also somewhat negative, namely, that Asiatics have not the same
            sentiment of independence and freedom as Europeans. Individuals are thought of as members of a family, state or religion, rather than as entities
            with a destiny and rights of their own. This leads to autocracy in politics, fatalism in religion and conservatism in both. Hence, too, Asiatic
            history has large and simple outlines. Though longer chronologically than the annals of Europe, it is less eventful, less diversified and offers
            fewer personalities of interest. But the same conditions which render individual eminence difficult procure for it when once attained a more ready
            recognition, and the conquerors and prophets of Asia have had more power and authority than their parallels in Europe. <name type="person"

          <p>3. Attention has often been called to the religious character of Asia. Not only the great religions of the world—Buddhism, Christianity, Islam—but
            those of secondary importance, such as Judaism, Parseeism, Taoism, are all Asiatic. No European race left to itself has developed anything more than
            an unsystematic paganism. It is true that Greek philosophy advanced far beyond this stage, but it produced nothing sufficiently popular to be called
            a religion. <pb n="750"/> On the other hand Christianity, though Asiatic in its origin and essential ideas, has to a large extent taken its present
            form on European soil, and some of its most important manifestations— notably <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name>—are European reconstructions in which little of the Asiatic
            element remains. Christianity has made little way farther east than <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name>.
            Modern missions have made no great conquests there, and in earlier times the Nestorians and Jacobites who penetrated to central Asia, China and
            India, received respectful hearing, but never had anything like the success which attended Buddhism and Islam. Yet Buddhism has never made much
            impression west of India, and Islam is clearly repugnant to Europeans, for even when under Moslem rule (as in Turkey) they refuse to accept it in a
            far larger proportion than did <name type="people">the Hindus</name> in similar circumstances. Hence there is clearly a deep-seated difference
            between the religious feelings of the two continents.</p>
          <p>Since Asiatic records go back much farther than those of Europe, it is natural that Asia should be thought the birthplace of civilization. But this
            originality cannot be absolute, for, whatever may have been the relations of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia"
              >Babylonia</name> and the Aryans, the latter brought civilization to India from the west, and it is not always clear whether similarity of
            government and institutions is the result of borrowing or of parallel development. Both in Europe and in Asia small feudal or aristocratic states
            tended to consolidate themselves into monarchies, but whereas in Europe from the early days of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> onwards royalty has often been driven out and replaced temporarily or permanently by
            popular government, this change seems not to occur in Asia, where revolution means only a change of dynasty. The few cases where the government is
            not monarchical, as <name type="place">Arabia</name>, seem to represent the persistence of very ancient conditions.</p>
          <p>The contemplation of Asia suggests that progress is most rapid when accompanied by the migration of races or the transplantation of ideas and
            institutions. Thus <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> excelled the Eastern countries from whom she
            may have derived her civilization, and Buddhism had a far more brilliant career outside India than in it.</p>

          <p>4. In many parts of southern Asia are found semi-barbarous races representing the earliest known stratum of population, such as <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vedda_people">the Veddahs</name> of Ceylon, and various tribes in China and the Malay Archipelago. Some of them
            offer analogies to the Australians. This connexion, if true, must be very ancient, since it apparently goes back to a time when the distribution of
            land and water was other than at present. In northern Asia are found other aborigines, such as <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ainu_people">the Ainus</name> of Japan and the so-called hyperborean races (<name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chukchi_people">Chukchis</name>, etc.), but no materials are at present forthcoming for their history. There is
            some record of the migrations of the later races superimposed on these aborigines. <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">The Chinese</name> came from the west, though how far west is unknown : <name type="people">the
              Hindus</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people">Persians</name> from the north-west: <name type="people"
              >the Burmese</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thai_people">the Siamese</name> from the north. We do not know if
              <name type="people">the Mongols</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, etc., had any earlier
            home than central Asia, but their extensive movements from that region are historical.</p>
          <p>The antiquity of Asiatic history is often exaggerated. With the exception of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia"
              >Babylonia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>, we can hardly even conjecture what was the
            condition of this continent much before 1500 B.C. At that period <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the
              Chinese</name> were advancing along the Hwang-ho, and the Aryans were entering India from the northwest. Both were in conflict with earlier races.
            The influence of Babylonian civilization was probably widespread. Some connexion between <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and China is generally admitted, and all Indian alphabets seem traceable to a Semitic
            original borrowed in the course of commerce from the Persian Gulf. Apart from European conquests, the internal history of Asia in the last 2000
            years is the result of the interaction of four main influences: <list>
              <item>(a) Chinese,</item>
              <item>(b) Indian,</item>
              <item>(c) Mahommedan,</item>
              <item>(d) Central Asian</item>
            </list>. Of these the first three represent different types of civilization : the fourth has little originality, but has been of great importance in
            affecting the distribution of races and political power.</p>
          <p>(a) China has moulded the civilization of the eastern mainland and Japan, without much affecting the Malay Archipelago. In the sphere of direct
            influence fall Korea, Japan and Annam ; in the outer sphere are Mongolia, Tibet, Siam, Cambodia and Burma, where Indian and Chinese influence are
            combined, the Indian being often the stronger. These countries, except Japan, have all been at some time at least nominal tributaries of China.
            Where Chinese influence had full play it introduced Confucianism, a special style in art and the Chinese system of writing. After the Christian era
            it was accompanied by Chinese Buddhism. The cumbrous Chinese script maintains itself in the Far East, but has not advanced west of China proper and
            Annam.</p>
          <p>(b) Indian influence may be defined as Buddhism, if it is understood that Buddhism is not at all periods clearly distinguishable from Hinduism. Its
            sphere includes Indo-China, much of the Malay Archipelago, Tibet and Mongolia. Moreover, China and Japan themselves may be said to fall within this
            sphere, in view of the part which Buddhism has played in their development. The Buddhist influence is not merely religious, for it is always
            accompanied by Indian art and literature, and often by an Indian alphabet. Much of this art is Greek in origin, being derived from the Perso-Greek
            states on the north-west frontiers of India. Indian alphabets have spread to Tibet, Cambodia, Java and Korea. The history of Indian civilization in
            Indo-China and the Archipelago is still obscure, in spite of the existence of gigantic ruins, but it would appear that in some parts at least two
            periods must be distinguished, first the introduction of Hinduism (or mixed Hinduism and Buddhism), perhaps under Indian princes, and secondly a
            later and more purely ecclesiastical introduction of Sinhalese Buddhism, with its literature and art.</p>
          <p>(c) Mahommedanism or Islam is perhaps the greatest transforming force which the world has seen. It has profoundly affected and to a large extent
            subjugated all western Asia including India, all eastern and northern Africa as well as Spain, and all eastern Europe. Its open advocacy of force
            attracts warlike races, and the intensity of its influence is increased by the fusion of secular and religious power, so that <name
              type="institution">the Moslem Church</name> is a Moslem state characterized by slavery, polygamy, and, subject to the autocracy of the ruler, by
            the theoretical equality of Moslems, who in political status are superior to non- Moslems. Thus, whenever the population of a Moslem country is of
            mixed belief, a ruling caste of Moslems is formed, as in Turkey at the present day and India under the Moguls. Islam is paramount in Turkey, Persia,
            Arabia and Afghanistan. India is the dividing line : Islam is strong in northern and central India, weaker in the south. But only one-fifth of the
            whole population is Moslem. Beyond India it has spread to Malacca and the Malay Archipelago, where it overwhelmed Hindu civilization, and reached
            the southern Philippines. But it made no progress in Indo-China or Japan ; and though there is a large Moslem population in China the Chinese
            influence has been stronger, for alone of all Asiatics <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> have
            succeeded in forcing Islam to accept the ordinary limitations of a religion and to take its place as a creed parallel to Buddbism or any other.</p>
          <p>Even more than Buddhism Islam has carried with it a special style of art and civilization. It is usually accompanied by the use of the Arabic
            alphabet, and in the languages of Moslem nations (notably Turkish, Persian, Hindustani and Malay) a large proportion of the vocabulary is borrowed
            from Arabic. Hindi and Hindustani, two forms of the same language as spoken by Hindus and Mahommedans respectively, are a curious example of how
            deeply religion may affect culture.</p>
          <p>(d) The great part which central Asian tribes have played in history is obscured by the absence of any common name for them. Linguistically they
            can be divided into several groups such as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>, <name type="people"
              >Mongols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, but they were from time to time united into states
            representing more than one group, and their armies were recruited, like the Janissaries, from all the military races in the neighbourhood. Soon
            after the Christian era central Asia began to boil over, and at least seven great invasions and more or less complete conquests can be ascribed to
            these tribes without counting minor movements. <list>

          <p>These tribes have a genius for warfare rather than for government, art or literature, and with few exceptions (e.g. <name type="people">the
              Moguls</name> in India) have proved poor administrators. Apart from conquest their most important function has been to keep up communications in
            central Asia, and to transport religions and civilizations from one region to another. Thus they are mainly responsible for the introduction of
            Islam with its Arabic or Persian civilization into India and Europe, and in earlier times their movements facilitated the infiltration of
            Graeco-Bactrian civilization into India besides maintaining communication between China and the West.</p>

          <p>—The movements mentioned above have been the chief factors of relatively modern Asiatic history, but in early times the centre of activity and
            culture lay farther west in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name>. These ancient states began to decline in the 7th century B.C., and on their ruins rose
              <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the Persian empire</name>, which with various political metamorphoses
            continued to be an important power till the 7th century A.D., after which all western Asia was overwhelmed by the Moslem wave, and old landmarks and
            kingdoms were obliterated.</p>
          <p>The materials for the study of their institutions and population are abundant, but lend themselves to discussion rather than to a summary of
            admitted facts. In the early history of southwestern Asia <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the Semites</name> form the
            most important ethnic group, which is primarily linguistic but also shares other remarkable characteristics. Two of the greatest religions of the
            world, Christianity and Islam, are Semitic in origin, as well as Judaism. In politics these races have been less successful in modern times, but the
            Semitic states of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> were once the principal centres for the development and distribution of civilization. It
            is generally agreed that this civilization can be traced back to an earlier race, the Sumero-Akkadians, whose language seems allied to the
            agglutinative idioms of central Asia. If this ancient civilized race was really allied to the ancestors of <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, it
            is a remarkable instance of how civilization thrives best by being transplanted at a certain period of growth. Still less is known of the early
            non-Aryan races of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Asia Minor</name> such as <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hittites">the Hittites</name> and <name type="people">Alorodians</name>. One hypothesis supposes that the shores

            neither Aryan nor Semitic.</p>
          <p>The earliest Sumerian records seem to be anterior to 4000 B.C. Shortly after that period <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> was invaded by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">the

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assyria">Assyria</name> was an offshoot of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia"
              >Babylonia</name> lying to the north-west, and apparently colonized before the second millennium. While using the same language as the
            Babylonians, the Assyrians had an individuality which showed itself in art and religion. In the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. they became the chief
            power within their sphere and the suzerain of their parent <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name>. But they
            succumbed before the advance of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the Medo-Persian power</name> in 606

          <p>—This is the oldest of existing states, though its authentic history does not go back much beyond 1000 B.C. It is generally admitted that there was
            some connexion between the ancient civilizations of China and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, but
            its precise nature is still uncertain. It is clear, however, that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yellow_River">the Hwang-ho</name> at an unknown period, possibly about 3000 B.C. In early historical times China

            incursions, or divided between rival dynasties, but at least twice became a great Asiatic power : under <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Han_Dynasty">the Han dynasty</name> (about 200 B.C-A.D. 220), and <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tang_Dynasty">the T'ang</name> (A.D. 618-906). The dominions of the latter extended across central Asia to

            nearly 300 years and despatched expeditions which reached India, Ceylon and East Africa. In 1644 <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ming_Dynasty">the Ming</name> succumbed to the attacks of <name type="people"

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beijing">Peking</name> and founded the present imperial house.</p>
          <p>Until the advent of Europeans, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> were always in contact with
            inferior races. Whether they expanded at the expense of weak aboriginal tribes or were conquered by more robust invaders, Chinese civilization
            prevailed and assimilated alike the conquered and the conquerors. It is largely to this that we must ascribe the national conservatism and contempt
            for foreigners. The spirit of the Chinese polity is self-contained, anti-military and anti-sacerdotal. Rank is nominally determined by merit, as
            tested by competitive examinations. Society is conceived as regulated by mutual obligations, of which the duties of parents and children are the
            most important. The emperor is head of the state and the high priest, who sacrifices to Heaven on behalf of his people, but he can be deposed, and
            no divine right is inherent in certain families as in Japan and Turkey. On the contrary there have been 20 dynasties since the Christian era.</p>
          <p>The most conspicuous figure in Chinese literature is <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confucius">Confucius</name> (551—475
            B.C). Though he laid no claim to originality and merely sought to collect and systematize the traditions of antiquity, his influence in the Far East
            has been unbounded, and he must be pronounced one of the most powerful advocates of peace and humanity that have ever existed. Confucianism is an
            ethical rather than a religious system, and hence was able to co-exist, though not on very friendly terms, with Buddhism, which reached China about
            the 1st century A.D. and was the chief source of Chinese religious ideas, except the older ancestor worship. But they are not a religious people,
            and like many Europeans regard the church as a department of the state.</p>

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Koreans">the Koreans</name>, which was possibly mingled with <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">Malay</name> elements after occupying the southern part of the islands. Authentic history
            does not begin till about the 6th century A.D., when Chinese civilization and Buddhism were introduced. The government was originally autocratic,
            but as early as the 7th century the most characteristic feature of Japanese politics— the power of great families who overshadowed the throne— makes
            its appearance. We hear first of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fujiwara_clan">the Fujiwara family</name>, and then of
            the rivalry between the houses of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taira_clan">Taira</name> and <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minamoto_clan">Minamoto</name>. The latter prevailed, and in 1192 established the dual system of government under
            which the emperor or Mikado ruled only in name, and the real power was in the hands of a hereditary military chief called Shogun. Japan has never
            been invaded in historical times, but an attempt made by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kublai_Khan">Kublai Khan</name> to
            conquer it was successfully repulsed. The chief power then passed to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashikaga_clan">the
              Ashikaga dynasty</name> of Shoguns, who retained it for about 200 years and were distinguished for their patronage of the arts. The second half of
            the 16th century was a period of ferment and anarchy, marked by the arrival of the Portuguese <pb n="752"/> and the rise of some remarkable
            adventurers, one of whom, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi">Hideyoshi</name>, conquered Korea and apparently
            meditated the invasion of China. His plans were interrupted by his death, and his successor, <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Ieyasu</name>, who shaped the social and political life of Japan for nearly 300 years
            (1603-1868), definitely decided on a policy of seclusion and isolation. All ideas of external conquest were abandoned, Christianity was forbidden,
            and Japan closed to foreigners, only the Dutch being allowed a strictly limited commerce. In 1854-1859 the Christian powers, beginning with the
            United States, successfully asserted their right to trade with Japan. The influx of new ideas provoked civil war, in which the already decadent
            Shogunate was abolished and the authority of the Mikado restored. Recognizing that their only chance of competing with Europeans was to fight them
            with their own weapons, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> set themselves deliberately to
            assimilate the material civilization and to some extent the institutions of Europe, such as constitutional government. Their progress and success
            are without parallel. In 1895 they defeated <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> and ten years
            later <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians">the Russians</name>. Their exceptional status among Asiatic nations has been
            recognized by treaties which, contrary to the general practice in non- Christian countries, place all foreigners in Japan under Japanese law.</p>
          <p>This sudden development of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the Japanese</name> is perhaps the most important
            event of the second half of the 19th century, since it marks the rise of an Asiatic power capable of competing with Europe on equal terms. Their
            history is so different from that of the rest of Asia that it is not surprising if the result is different. The nation hardly came into existence
            till China and India had passed their prime, and remained secluded and free from the continual struggle against barbarian invaders, which drained
            the energies of its neighbours. It was left untouched by Mahommedanism, and for an unprecedentedly long period kept Europeans at bay without wasting
            its strength in hostilities. The military spirit was evolved, not in raids and massacres of the usual Asiatic type which create little but intense
            racial hatred, but in feuds between families and factions of the same race, which restrained ferocity and tended to create a temper like that of the
            feudal chivalry of Europe. On the other hand it is noticeable that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">the
              Japanese</name> have little which is original in the way of religion, literature or philosophy. Unlike <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name> and <name type="people">Indians</name>, they have hitherto not had the
            smallest influence on the intellectual development of Asia, and though they have in the past sometimes shown themselves intensely nationalist and
            conservative, they have, compared with India and China, so little which is really their own that their assimilation of foreign ideas is
            explicable.</p>

          <p>—The population of India comprises at least three strata: firstly, uncivilized aborigines, such as <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kol_people">the Kols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Santals">Santhals</name>,
            and secondly, the Dravidians (<name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tamil_people">Tamils</name>, <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kannadiga">Kanarese</name>, etc.), who perhaps represent the earliest northern invaders, and appear to have
            attained some degree of culture on their own account. The most recent authorities are of opinion that the Kolarians and Dravidians represent a
            single physical type; but, whatever the historical explanation may be, they certainly have different languages and show different stages of
            civilization. In prehistoric times they were spread over the whole of India, but were driven to the centre and south of the peninsula by the third
            stratum of Aryans, and perhaps also by invasions of so-called Mongolian races from the north-west. No historical record has been preserved of these
            latter, but they appear to have profoundly affected the population of Bengal, which is believed to be Mongolo- Dravidian in composition. The Aryans
            appear to have been settled to the north of the Hindu Kush, and to have migrated south-eastwards about 1500 B.C. Their original home has been a
            subject of much discussion, but the view now prevalent is that they arose in southern Russia or Asia Minor, whence a section spread eastwards and
            divided into two closely related branches— the Hindus and Iranians. There were probably two successive Aryan immigrations, and the tradition of a
            struggle between them may be preserved in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mahābhārata"><hi rend="italic">the Mahābhārata</hi></title>. The
            life of the ancient Aryans, as portrayed in their sacred songs, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rigveda"><hi rend="italic">the Rig
              Veda</hi></title>, was quasi-nomadic and in many ways democratic, but by the 6th century B.C. settled states had been formed in the Ganges valley.
            They were absolute monarchies, but the power of the king was tempered by the extraordinary influence possessed by the hereditary sacerdotal class or
            Brahmans. The position of this class, which has remained till the present day, is connected with the institution of caste, a division of the
            population into groups founded partly on racial distinctions. The peaceful progress of Brahmanism was hindered by the doctrine of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gautama_Buddha">the Indian prince Gotama, called the Buddha,</name> which grew into one of the
            greatest religions of the world. For many centuries the culture and development of <name type="people">the Hindus</name> depended mainly on the
            interaction of the old Brahmanical religion and Buddhism. The latter was finally absorbed, and disappeared in India itself, but has spread Indian
            influence over the whole of eastern Asia, where it still flourishes.</p>
          <p>In 326 B.C. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name> invaded <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Punjab_region">the Punjab</name>. The immediate result was small, but the establishment of Perso-Greek kingdoms
            in central Asia had a powerful influence on Indian art and culture. It may also have helped to familiarize the Hindu mind with the idea of an
            empire, which appeared among them later than in other Asiatic countries. The first empire, called <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maurya_Empire">Maurya</name>, reached its greatest extent in the time of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ashoka_the_Great">Asoka</name> (264-227 B.C.), who ruled from Afghanistan to <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chennai">Madras</name>. He was a zealous Buddhist and gave the first example of a missionary religion, for by his
            exertions the faith was spread over all India and Ceylon. No Hindu empires have lasted long, and the Maurya dominions broke up fifty years after his
            death.</p>
          <p>In the next period (c. 150 B.C.-A.D. 300) India was invaded from the north by tribes partly of Parthian and partly of Turki (<name type="people"

            has not yet been set beyond dispute, but the most important was that of <name type="people">the Kushans</name>, whose king <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kanishka">Kanishka</name> founded a state which comprised northern India and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kashmir">Kashmir</name>. They were Buddhists, and it is probable that the Mahāyāna or northern form of Buddhism
            was due to an amalgamation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gautama_Buddha">Gotama</name>'s doctrines with the ideas (largely
            Greek and Persian) which they brought with them. Much of Sivaism has probably the same origin. Another native empire, known as <name

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kushan_Empire">the Kushan kingdom</name>, and embraced nearly the whole peninsula, but it broke up in the 5th
            century, partly owing to the attacks of new northern invaders, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">the Huns</name>. <name
              type="institution">The Malava dynasty</name> maintained Hindu civilization in the 6th century, and from 606 to 646 <name type="person"

              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kannauj">Kanauj</name>. This epoch is marked by the renaissance of Sanskrit literature and the
            gradual revival of Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. But after <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harsha">Harsha</name> Hindu
            history is lost in a maze of small and transitory states, incapable of resisting the ever advancing Mahommedan peril. As early as 712 <name
              type="people">the Arabs</name> conquered Sind, and by the end of the 11th century the whole of northern India was in Moslem hands. Two periods may
            be distinguished, namely the Turki (1200-1526) and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name>.
            The former comprised several dynasties of mixed Turki and Iranian race, but was wanting in coherency. In the neighbourhood of the Moslem capitals,
            Islam spread rapidly, but in such districts as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rajputana">Rajputana</name> and specially <name

              >(Mysore)</name> Hindu civilization and religion maintained themselves.</p>
          <p>In 1526 <name type="people">the Moguls</name> descended on India from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transoxiana"
              >Transoxiana</name> and seized the throne of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delhi">Delhi</name>. They never subjugated the
            south, but the empire which they founded in the north was for about two centuries, under such rulers as <name type="person"

              Jehan</name>, one of the most brilliant which Asia has seen. After 1707 it began to decline: the governors became independent: a powerful <pb

            it lasted as a name till the Mutiny (1857).</p>
          <p>Indian history until Mahommedan times is marked by the unusual prominence of religious ideas, and is a record of intellectual development rather
            than of political events. Whatever national unity the Hindu peoples possessed came from the persistent and penetrating influence of the Brahman
            caste. Kings held a secondary position, and were generally regarded as adventitious tyrants, rather than as the heads and representatives of the
            nation. Even the great dynasties have left few traces, and it is with difficulty that the patient historian disinters the minor kingdoms from
            obscurity, but Indian religion, literature and art have influenced all Asia from Persia to Japan.</p>

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medes">the Medes</name>, appear to be pure Aryans in origin, and the earliest form of their language and religion

            and those of <name type="people">the Hindus</name> at one time formed a single tribe somewhere in central Asia. The religion was remodelled by <name

            the 6th century onwards their empire, then known as Median, began to expand at the expense of the surrounding states. They destroyed <name

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyrus_the_Great">Cyrus</name>, seems to indicate merely the pre-eminence of a particular tribe and not conquest
            by another race. The power of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the Achaemenidae</name>, when at its
            maximum, extended from the Oxus and Indus in the east to Thrace in the west and Egypt in the south, but fell before Greece, after lasting for rather
            more than 200 years. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_I_of_Persia">Darius</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xerxes_I_of_Persia">Xerxes</name> were repulsed in their efforts to subjugate the Greek Peninsula, and <name

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darius_III_of_Persia">Darius III.</name> in 329. But the greater part of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Achaemenid_Empire">the empire</name> continued to exist under new masters, the Seleucids, as a Hellenistic power
            which was of great importance for the dissemination of Greek culture in the East. Bactria soon became independent under an Indo- Greek dynasty, and
            the blending of Greek, Persian, central Asiatic and Hindu influences had an important effect on the art and religion of India, and through India on
            all eastern Asia. About the same period (250 B.C.-A.D. 227) <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arsacid_Empire">the Parthian
              empire</name> arose under the Arsacids in Khorasan and the adjacent districts. <name type="people">The Parthians</name> appear to have been a
            Turanian tribe who had adopted many Persian customs. They successfully withstood the Romans, and at one time their power extended from India to
            Syria. They succumbed to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sassanid_Empire">the Persian dynasty of the Sassanids</name>, who
            ruled successfully for about four centuries, established the Zoroastrian faith as their state religion, and maintained a creditable conflict with
              <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">the East Roman empire</name>. But in the 7th century they were
            defeated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heraclius">Heraclius</name>, and shortly afterwards were annihilated before the
            first impetus of the Mahommedan conquest, which established Islam in Persia and the neighbouring lands, sweeping away old civilizations and
            boundaries. During the greater part of the Mahommedan period Persia has been ruled by troubled and short-lived dynasties. It attained a certain
            dignity and unity under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbas_I_of_Persia">Abbas Shah</name> (1585-1628), but in later times
            was distracted and disorganized by Afghan invasions. The present dynasty, which is of Turkoman origin, dates from 1789.</p>
          <p>The achievements of the Persians in art, literature and religion are by no means contemptible, but somewhat mixed and cosmopolitan. Owing to its
            position, the Persian state, when it from time to time became a conquering empire, overlapped Asia Minor, Babylon and India, and hence acted as an
            intermediary for transmitting art and ideas, sending for instance Greek sculpture to India and the cult of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mithra">Mithra</name> to western Europe. It is perhaps on account of this intermediate flavour that the
            literature of Persia—for instance the adaptations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omar_Khayyám">Omar Khayyam</name>— is more
            appreciated in Europe than that of other Oriental nations. On the other hand, the wars between Persia and Greece were recognized both at the time
            and afterwards as a struggle between Europe and Asia; the fact that both combatants were Aryans was not felt, and has no importance compared to the
            difference of continent.</p>

            without becoming either socially merged or politically distinct. Their traditional history represents them as migrating to the borders of Egypt and
            living there for some centuries. After the exodus, which perhaps took place about 1300 B.C., they moved northwards again and founded a state of

            so much of Israel as of western Asia generally. In 588 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nebuchadnezzar_II">Nebuchadrezzar</name>

            succeeding years. But long before this period the Jews of the Dispersion had become as important as the inhabitants of Palestine. From choice or
            compulsion large numbers settled in Egypt in the time of the Ptolemies, and added an appreciable element to Alexandrine culture, while gradual
            voluntary emigration established Jewish communities in Syria, Asia Minor, Greece and Italy, who facilitated the first spread of Christianity. In
            spite of chronic unpopularity and recurring persecutions they have spread over nearly all Europe. At the end of the 15th century they were expelled
            from Spain and many of the exiles moved eastwards. At present the largest numbers are to be found in the eastern parts of Europe. It is remarkable
            that though <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">the Jews</name> live in relative peace with Asiatics, the great majority of

          <p>—This widely - scattered race has no political union and its distribution is a puzzle for ethnography. At present it occupies the extremity of the
            Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines and other islands of the Malay Archipelago as well as Madagascar, while the inhabitants of
            most islands in the South Seas, including New Zealand and Hawaii, speak languages which if not Malay have at least undergone a strong Malay
            influence. It would seem from this distribution that <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">the Malays</name>
            are not continental, but a seafaring race with exceptional powers of dispersal, who have spread over the ocean from some island centre—perhaps Java.
            The latest theory, however, is that there is a great linguistic group (which may or may not prove to correspond to an ethnic unity) comprising the
            Mundā, Mōnkhmer, Malay, Polynesian and Micronesian languages, and that the stream of immigration which distributed them started from the extreme
            west. Three periods can be traced in the history of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malays_(ethnic_group)">the Asiatic
              Malays</name>. In the first (in which such tribes as <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dayak_people">the Dyaks</name> have
            remained) they were semi-barbarous. In the second, Hindu civilization reached the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and other islands. The presence of
            Hindu ruins, as well as of numerous Indian words and customs, testifies to the strength of this influence. It was, however, superseded by Islam,
            which spread to the Malay Archipelago and Peninsula before the 16th century. At the present time the Arabic alphabet is used on the mainland, but
            Indian alphabets in Java, Sumatra, etc.</p>

          <p>—This remote and mountainous country has a peculiar civilization. It has entirely escaped Islam, and though it is a nominal vassal of China, direct
            Chinese influence has not been strong. The most striking feature is the religion, a corrupt form of late Indian Buddhism, known as Lamaism, which,
            largely in consequence of the favour shown by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genghis_Khan">Jenghiz Khan</name> and his
            successors, has attained temporal power and developed into an ecclesiastical state curiously like the papacy.</p>

          <p>18. Almost all Asiatic countries have a literature, but it is often not indigenous and consists of foreign works, chiefly religious, read either in
            translations or the original. Thus with the exception of a little folklore the literature of Indo-China, Tibet, Mongolia, Korea and Manchuria is
            mainly Indian or Chinese. The chief original literatures are Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic and Persian. <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japanese_people">The Japanese</name> have produced few books of importance, and their compositions are chiefly
            remarkable as being lighter and more secular than is usual in Asia, but the older Chinese works take high rank both for their merits and the effect
            they have had. The extensive Sanskrit literature, which has reached in translations China, Japan and Java, is chiefly theological and poetical,
            history being conspicuously absent. India has also a considerable medieval and modern literature in various languages. Pali, though only a form of
            Hindu literature, has a separate history, for it died in India and was preserved in Ceylon, whence it was imported to Burma and Siam as the language
            of religion. The Pali versions of Buddha's discourses are among the most remarkable products of Asia. The literatures of all Moslem peoples are
            largely inspired by Arabic, which has produced a voluminous collection of works in prose and poetry. Persian, after being itself transformed by
            Arabic, has in its turn largely influenced all west Asiatic Moslem literature from Hindustani to Turkish.</p>
          <p>If one excepts <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Testament">the Old Testament</title>, which is a product of the extreme west of Asia, it
            is remarkable how small has been the influence of Asiatic literature on Europe. Though Greek and Slavonic almost ceased to be written languages
            under Turkishrule, Europeans showed no disposition to replace them by Ottoman or Arabic literature.</p>
          <p>Without counting subdivisions, there would seem to be three main schools of art in Asia at present—Chinese, Indian and Moslem. The first contains
            many original elements. It is feeblest in architecture and strongest in the branches demanding skill and care in a limited compass, such as
            painting, porcelain and enamel. It is the main inspiration of Japanese art, which, however, shows great originality in its treatment of borrowed
            themes. Both China and Japan have felt through Buddhism the influence of Indian art, which contains at least two elements— one indigenous and the
            other Greco-Persian. Unlike Chinese art it has a genius for architecture and sculpture rather than painting. Mahommedan art is also largely
            architectural and has affected <pb n="755"/> nearly all Moslem countries. Except that the use of Arabic inscriptions is one of its principal methods
            of decoration, it owes little to Arabia and much to Byzantium. The Persian variety of this art is more ornate, and less averse to representations of
            living beings. Both Moslem and Chinese art are closely connected with calligraphy, but Hindus rarely use writing for ornament.</p>
          <p>In both art and literature modern Asia is inferior to the past more conspicuously than Europe.</p>
          <p>As for science, astronomy was cultivated by the Babylonians at an early period, and it is probably from them that a knowledge of the heavenly
            bodies and their movements spread over Asia. Grammar and prosody were studied in India with a marvellous accuracy and minuteness several centuries
            before <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus">Christ</name>. Mathematics were cultivated by <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chinese_people">the Chinese</name>, <name type="people">Indians</name> and <name type="people">Arabs</name>, but
            nearly all the sciences based on the observation of nature, including medicine, have remained in a very backward condition. Much the same, however,
            might have been said of Europe until two centuries ago, and the scientific knowledge of <name type="people">the Arabs</name> under the earlier <name
              type="institution">Caliphates</name> was equal or superior to that of any of their contemporaries. Histories and accounts of travels have been
            composed both in Arabic and Chinese.</p>

          <p>19. It is only natural that Europe should have chiefly felt the influence of western Asia. Though Europeans may be indebted to China for some
            mechanical inventions, she was too distant to produce much direct effect, and the influence of India has been mainly directed towards the East. The
            resemblances between primitive Christianity and Buddhism appear to be coincidences, and though both early Greek philosophy and later Alexandrine
            ideas suggest Indian affinities, there is no clear connexion such as there is between certain aspects of Chinese thought and India.</p>
          <p>Any general statement as to the debt owed by early European civilizations to western Asia would at present be premature, for though important
            discoveries have been made in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name> the best authorities are chary of positive conclusions as to the relations of <name

            the alphabet is more complex than was supposed.</p>
          <p>In historic times Asia has attempted to assert her influence over Europe by a series of invasions, most of which have been repulsed. Such were the
            Persian wars of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, and perhaps one may add <name type="person"

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Huns">Huns</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">Bulgarians</name>, and later
            by <name type="people">Mongols</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">Turks</name>. Islam has twice

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople"
              >Constantinople</name>. The earlier Asiatic invasions were conducted by armies operating at a distance from their bases, and had little result,
            for the soldiery retired after a time (like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name> from India),
            or more rarely (e.g. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">the Bulgarians</name>) settled down without keeping up any
            connexion with Asia. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">The Turks</name>, and to some extent <name type="people"
              >the Arabs</name> in Spain, were successful because they first conquered the parts of Asia and Africa adjoining Europe, so that the final invaders
            were in touch with Asiatic settlements. Though <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkic_peoples">the Turks</name> have profoundly
            affected the whole of eastern Europe, the result of their conquests has been not so much to plant Asiatic culture in Europe as to arrest development
            entirely, the countries under their rule remaining in much the same condition as under the moribund <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine empire</name>.</p>
          <p>In general, Europe has in historic times shown itself decidedly hostile to Asiatic institutions and modes of thought. It is only of recent years
            that the writings of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_Schopenhauer">Schopenhauer</name> and the researches of many
            distinguished orientalists have awakened some interest in Asiatic philosophy.</p>
          <p>The influence of Asia on Africa has been considerable, and until the middle of the 19th century greater than that of Europe. Some authorities hold
            that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egyptian</name> civilization came from <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylonia">Babylonia</name>, and that the so-called Hamitic languages are older and less specialized members of
            the Semitic family. The connexion between <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carthage">Carthage</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia">Phoenicia</name> is more certain, and the ancient <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethiopian_Empire">Abyssinian kingdom</name> was founded by <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semitic">Semites</name> from south Arabia. The traditions of <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somali_people">the Somalis</name> derive them from the same region. The theory that the ruins in <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mashonaland">Mashonaland</name> were built by immigrants from south Arabia is now discredited, but
            there was certainly a continuous stream of <name type="people">Arab</name> migration to East Africa which probably began in pre-Moslem times and
            founded a series of cities on the coast. The whole of the north of Africa from Egypt to Morocco has been mahommedanized, and Mahommedan influence is
            general and fairly strong from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timbuktu">Timbuktu</name> to <name type="place"

          <p>The relation to Asia of the pre-European civilizations of America is another of those questions which admit of no definite answer at present,

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Influence of Europe on Asia.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>20. European influence on Asia has been specially strong at two epochs, firstly after the conquests of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander the Great</name>, and secondly from the 16th century onwards. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</name>'s conquests resulted in the foundation of Perso-Greek kingdoms in Asia,
            which not only hellenized their own area but influenced the art and religion of India and to some extent of China. Then follows a long period in
            which eastern Europe was mainly occupied in combating Asiatic invasions, and had little opportunity of Europeanizing the East. Somewhat later the
            Crusades kept up communication with the Levant, and established there the power of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Church</name>, somewhat to the detriment of oriental Christianity, but
            intercourse with farther Asia was limited to the voyages of a few travellers. Looking at eastern Europe and western Asia only, one must say that
            Asiatic influences have on the whole prevailed hitherto (though perhaps the tide is turning), for Islam is paramount in this region and European
            culture at a low ebb. But the case is quite different if one looks at the two continents as a whole, for improvement in means of communication has
            brought about strange vicissitudes, and western Europe has asserted her power in middle and eastern Asia.</p>
          <p>In the 16th century a new era began with the discovery by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_people">the
              Portuguese</name> of the route to India round <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cape_of_Good_Hope">the Cape</name>, and the
            naval powers of Europe started one after another on careers of oriental conquest. The movement was maritime and affected the nations in the extreme
            west of Europe rather than those nearer Asia, who were under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Turkish
              yoke</name>. Also the parts of Asia affected were chiefly India and the extreme East. The countries west of India, being less exposed to naval
            invasion, remained comparatively untouched. It will thus be seen that European (excluding Russian) power in Asia is based almost entirely on
            improved navigation. There was no attempt to overwhelm whole empires by pouring into them masses of troops, but commerce was combined with
            territorial acquisition, and a continuity of European interest secured by the presence of merchants and settlers. The course of oriental conquest
            followed the events of European politics, and the possessions of European powers in the East generally changed hands according to the fortunes of
            their masters at home. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name> was first on the scene, and in the 16th century
            established a considerable littoral empire on the coasts of East Africa, India and China, fragments of which still remain, especially <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Goa">Goa</name>, where Portuguese influence on the natives was considerable. Before the century was
            out <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name> appeared as the successful rivals of <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portuguese_people">the Portuguese</name>, but the real struggle for supremacy in southern Asia took place between
            France and England about 1740-1783. Both entered India as commercial companies, but the disorganized condition of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mughal_Empire">the Mogul empire</name> necessitated the use <pb n="756"/> of military force to protect their
            interests, and allured them to conquest. The companies gradually undertook the financial control of the districts where they traded and were
            recognized by the natives as political powers. The ultimate victory of England seems due less to any particular aptitude for dealing with oriental
            problems than to a better command of the seas and to considerations of European politics. At the end of the Napoleonic wars Portugal had Macao and
            Goa, Holland Java, Sumatra and other islands, France some odds and ends in India, while England emerged with Hong Kong, Singapore, Ceylon and a free
            hand in India. Guided by such administrators as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warren_Hastings">Warren Hastings</name>, <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_India_Company">the East India Company</name> had assumed more and more definitely the
            functions of government for a great part of India. In 1809 its exclusive trading rights were taken away by <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom">Parliament</name>, but its administrative status was thus made clearer, and
            when after the mutiny of 1857 it was desirable to define British authority in India there seemed nothing unnatural in declaring it to be a
            possession of the crown.</p>
          <p>Another category of European possessions in Asia comprises those acquired towards the end of the 19th century, such as Indo-China (France), Burma
            and Wei-Hai-Wei (Britain), and Kiao-Chow (Germany). Whereas the earlier conquests were mostly the results of large half-conscious national movements
            working out their destinies in the East, these later ones were annexations deliberately planned by European cabinets. It seemed to be assumed that
            Asia was to be divided among the powers of Europe, and each was anxious to get its share or more.</p>
          <p>The advance of Russia in Asia is entirely different from that of the other powers, since it has taken place by land and not by sea. Though the
            geographical extent of Russian territory and influence is enormous, she has always moved along the line of least resistance. She is a moderately
            strong empire lying to the north of the great Moslem states, and having for neighbours a series of very weak principalities or semi-civilized
            tribes. The conquest of Siberia and central Asia presented no real difficulties: Persia and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constantinople">Constantinople</name> were left on one side, and Russia was defeated as soon as she was opposed
            by a vigorous power in the Far East. As the Russian possessions in Asia are continuous with European Russia, it is only natural that they should
            have been russified far more thoroughly than the British possessions have been anglicized.</p>
          <p>There has been great difference of opinion as to the extent to which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_the_Great"
              >Alexander</name>'s conquests influenced Asia, and it is equally hard to say what is the effect now being produced by Europe. Clearly such
            alterations as the construction of railways in nearly all parts of the continent, and the establishment of peace over formerly disturbed areas like
            India, are of enormous importance, and must change the life of the people. But the mental constitution of Asiatics is less easily modified than
            their institutions, and even Japan has assimilated European methods rather than European ideas.</p>

        <div type="article">
          <p>(through Fr. <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">cité</hi></foreign>, from Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >civitas</hi></foreign>). In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name>, strictly speaking,
              <q>"city"</q> is an honorary title, officially applied to those towns which, in virtue of some pre-eminence (e.g. as episcopal sees, or great
            industrial centres), have by traditional usage or royal charter acquired the right to the designation. In <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name> the official style of <q>"city"</q> does not necessarily involve the
            possession of municipal power greater than those of the ordinary boroughs, nor indeed the possession of a corporation at all (e.g. <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ely,_Cambridgeshire">Ely</name>). In <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name> and the British colonies, on the other hand, the official application of
            the term <q>"city"</q> depends on the kind and extent of the municipal privileges possessed by the corporations, and charters are given raising
            towns to the rank of cities. Both in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> the word is used to distinguish the older and central nucleus of some of the large towns,
            e.g. the <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">Cité</hi></foreign> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>,
            and the <q>"square mile"</q> under the jurisdiction of the lord mayor which is <q><name type="place"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London">"the City of London."</name></q></p>
          <p>In common usage, however, the word implies no more than a somewhat vague idea of size and dignity, and is loosely applied to any large centre of
            population. Thus while, technically, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London">"the City of London"</name>. is quite
            small, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> is yet properly described as the largest city in the world. In
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name> this use of the word is still more loose, and any
            town, whether technically a city or not, is usually so designated, with little regard to its actual size or importance.</p>
          <p>It is clear from the above that the word <q>"city"</q> is incapable of any very clear and inclusive definition, and the attempt to show that
            historically it possesses a meaning that clearly differentiates it from <q>"town"</q> or <q>"borough"</q> has led to some controversy. As the
            translation of the Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">πόλις</hi></foreign> or Latin <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >civitas</hi></foreign> it involves the ancient conception of the state or <q>"city-state,"</q> i.e. of the state as not too large to prevent
            its government through the body of the citizens assembled in the <foreign xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">agora</hi></foreign>, and is applied not
            to the place but to the whole body politic. From this conception both the word and its dignified connotation are without doubt historically derived.
            On the occupation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name> the Gallic states and tribes were called <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">civitates</hi></foreign> by the Romans, <pb n="401"/> and subsequently the name was confined to the chief towns of
            the various administrative districts. These were also the seats of the bishops. It is thus affirmed that in <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> from the 5th to the 15th century the name <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >civitas</hi></foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">cité</hi></foreign> was confined to such towns as were episcopal sees, and
                <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_du_Fresne,_sieur_du_Cange">du Cange</name> (<title>Gloss</title>, s.v.
                <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">civitas</hi></foreign>)</ref> defines that word as <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">urbs
                episcopalis</hi></foreign>, and states that other towns were termed <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">castra</hi></foreign> or <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">oppida</hi></foreign>. How far any such distinction can be sharply drawn may be doubted. With regard to <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> no definite line can be drawn between those towns to which the name <foreign
              xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">civitas</hi></foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">cité</hi></foreign> is given in medieval
            documents and those called <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">burgi</hi></foreign> or boroughs (<ref>see <bibl><author><name type="person"

              >Blackstone</name> that a city is a town incorporate which is or has been the see of a bishop. It is true, indeed, that the actual sees in <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> all have a formal right to the title; the boroughs erected into episcopal
            sees by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII</name> thereby became <q>"cities"</q>; but towns such
            as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thetford">Thetford</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sherborne"
              >Sherborne</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dorchester,_Dorset">Dorchester</name> are never so designated, though
            they are regularly incorporated and were once episcopal sees. On the other hand, it has only been since the latter part of the 19th century that the
            official style of <q>"city"</q> has, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name>, been
            conferred by royal authority on certain important towns which were not episcopal sees, <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Birmingham">Birmingham</name> in 1889 being the first to be so distinguished. It is interesting to note that
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name>, besides 27 boroughs, now contains two cities, one (<name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London">"the City of London"</name>) outside, the other (<name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_Westminster">the City of Westminster</name>) included in the administrative county. For the history of

            particular owners or races is easy; this gives the common use of the word for the land inhabited by a particular nation or race. Another meaning is

        <head><hi rend="bold">EDUCATION.</hi></head>
        <div type="article">
          <p>In the following treatment of this subject, the theory and early history of education is first dealt with, and secondly the modern organization of
            education as a national concern. Many definitions have been given of the word <q>"education,"</q> but underlying them all is the conception that it
            denotes an attempt on the part of the adult members of a human society to shape the development of the coming generation in accordance with its own
            ideals of life. It is true that the word has not infrequently been used in wider senses than this. For example, <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Stuart_Mill">J.S. Mill</name> included under it everything which <quote>"helps to shape the human
                being"</quote></ref>; and, with some poetic licence, we speak of the education of a people or even of the whole human race. But all such usages
            are rhetorical extensions of the commonly accepted sense of the term, which includes, as an essential element, the idea of deliberate direction and
            training (Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">educare</hi></foreign>, to bring up; <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >educere</hi></foreign>, to draw out, lead forth). No doubt, all education is effected through the experiences of the educated, and much of it is
            indirect, consisting mainly in the determination of the form of experiences other than those of direct precept, compulsion and instruction. But it
            does not follow that all experiences are educative. Whether an experience is part of an individual's education or not is determined by its origin.
            Whatever be its effect, it is educative in so far as its form has been arranged with greater or less deliberation by those who are concerned with
            the training of him whose experience it is. It follows that an education may be good or bad, and that its goodness or badness will be relative to
            the virtue, wisdom and intelligence of the educator. It is good only when it aims at the right kind of product, and when the means it adopts are
            well adapted to secure the intended result and are applied intelligently, consistently and persistently.</p>
          <p>Education is, thus, a definitely personal work, and will vary between wide extremes of effectiveness and worth in any given society. For in all
            times and places there are wide differences in virtue, wisdom and capacity among those who have in their hands the care and nurture of the young.
            But the inference that, therefore, no comparative estimate of the education of different times and places can be made would be fallacious. For,
            despite all differences in conception and efficiency among individual educators, each expresses, more or less perfectly and clearly, the common
            conception and energy of his age and country. As these rise or fall the general level of the actual educative practice rises or sinks with them. The
            first essential for successful educative effort is, then, that the community as a whole should have a true estimate of the nature and value of
            education.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt">I. EDUCATIONAL THEORY</head>
          <p>In any comparative estimate of different places and times, as tested by the standard just given, it must be borne in mind that, except in the most
            general and abstract form, we cannot speak of an ideally best education. Looking at the individual to be educated, we may say with <ref><name
                type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> that the aim of education is <quote>"to develop in the body and in the soul
                all the beauty and all the perfection of which they are capable,"</quote></ref> but this leaves quite undecided the nature and form of that
            beauty and perfection, and on such points there has never been universal agreement at any one time, while successive ages have shown marked
            differences of estimate. We get nearer to the point when we reflect that individual beauty and perfection are shown, and only shown, in actual life,
            and that such life has to be lived under definite conditions of time, place, culture, religion, national aspirations and mastery over material
            conditions. Perfection of life, then, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">the Athens</name> of the age of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> would show a very different form from that which it would take in the <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> of
            to-day. So an individualistic statement of the purpose of education leads on analysis to considerations that are not, in themselves,
            individualistic. The personal life is throughout a relation between individual promptings to activity and the environment in which alone such
            promptings can, by being actualized, become part of life. And the perfection of the life is to be sought in the perfection of the relations thus
            established. So far, then, as any conception of education can give guidance to the actual process it must be relative in every way to the state of
            development of the society in which it is given. Indeed, looked at in the mass, education may be said to be the efforts made by the community to
            impose its culture upon the growing generation. Here again is room for difference. The culture in question may be accepted as absolute at least in
            its essentials, and then the ideal of education will be to secure its stability and perpetuation, or it may be regarded as a stage in a process of
            development, and then the ideal will be to facilitate the advance of the next generation beyond the point reached by the present. So some ages will
            show a relatively fixed conception of the educative process, others will be times of unrest and change in this as in other modes of social and
            intellectual life.</p>
          <p>It is in these latter times that the actual work of education is apt to lose touch with the culture of the community. For schools (q.v.) and
            universities (q.v.), which are the ordinary channels through which adult culture reaches the young, are naturally conservative and bound by
            tradition. They are slow to leave the old paths which have hitherto led to the desired goal, and to enter on new and untried ways. If the opposition
            to change is absolute, there must come a time when the instruments of education are out of true relation to the desired end. For change in culture
            ideals means change in the specific form of the goal of education, and consequently the paths of educative effort need readjustment. When the goal
            of the past is no longer the goal of the present, to follow the ways which led to <pb n="952"/> the former is to fail to reach the latter.
            Continuous readjustment, by small and almost imperceptible degrees, is the ideal at which the educator should aim. When this is not secured, the
            educational domain is liable to sudden and violent revolutions which are destructive of successful educative effort at the time they occur, however
            beneficial their results may be in the future.</p>
          <p>But the relation of adjustment is not entirely one-sided. The tone of thought and feeling and the direction of will induced by education
            necessarily affect, the common ideals of the next generation, and may make them better or worse than those of the present. Hence, the educator must
            not blindly accept all current views of life, but rather select the highest. For the average thought of every community is obviously below its best
            thought; and may, in some points at any rate, be lower than the best thought of a past age. While, then, all true education must be in direct
            relation with the culture of its age and country, yet, especially on the ethical side, it should aim at transcending the average thought and
            tone.</p>
          <p>Still more does this imply that education strives to transcend the present condition of the educated by making their life more rational, more
            volitional, and more attracted by goodness and beauty than it would otherwise be. It can never be a passive watching of the child's development. No
            more fundamental error can be made than the assumption that education can be determined wholly, or even mainly, by the tendencies and impulses with
            which a child is endowed. Its real guiding principle must be a conception of the nature to which the child may attain, not a knowledge of that with
            which it starts. The educator studies the original endowment of the child and the early stages in the development of that innate nature in order
            that he may, wisely and successfully, employ appropriate means to direct further development and to accelerate its progress towards a more rational,
            complete and worthy life; not that he may the more skilfully give facilities to the child to drift about on the unregulated currents of caprice.</p>
          <p>Such considerations show the importance of an insight into the theory of education on the part of all who are practically concerned with its
            direction. But the theory required is no system of abstract ideas ignoring the real concrete conditions of the life for which the actual education
            it is to guide is a preparation. To approach the subject only from the standpoint of the mental sciences which underlie it is to run the risk of
            setting up such a body of abstractions, whose relation to real life is neither very close nor very direct. The most profitable way of developing an
            educational theory for the present is to trace how in the past education has consciously adapted itself, more or less truly and fully, to the
            conditions of culture and social life; and by analysis to discover the reasons for comparative success or failure in the degree of clearness with
            which the end to be sought was apprehended and the nature of the children to be trained was understood.</p>
          <p>In all ages the claims of the individual and those of the community have struggled for the mastery as the ultimate principles of life. As one or
            the other has prevailed the conception of education has emphasized social service or individual success as the primary end. The true harmony of
            human life will only be attained when these two impulses, contradictory on their own level, are united in a higher synthesis which sees each as the
            complement of the other in a life whose purpose is neither simple egoism nor pure altruism. Until that conception of life is attained and held
            generally there can be no sure and universally accepted conception of the aim and function of education. Much of the interest of the history of
            education <note>For the evolution of the school as such from early times see SCHOOLS.</note> turns on the relation of these two principles as
            determinants of its aim.</p>

          <p>In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">ancient Greece</name> the supremacy of the state was generally unquestioned,
            and, especially in the earlier times, the good man was identified with the good citizen. No doubt, in later days phflosophers, such as <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle"
              >Aristotle</name>, saw clearly that the round of the duties of citizenship did not exhaust the life of the individual. With them the highest life
            was one of cultured leisure in which the energies were mainly concentrated on the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. But this <q>"diagogic"</q>
            life was only for the select few; for the undistinguished many the fulfilment by each of the duties of his station remained the measure of worthy
            life, though such duties were regarded as affecting the individual and private relations of the citizens in a much more intimate way than in former
            and ruder ages. And for those who devoted their lives to the highest culture, the essential preliminary condition was the existence of such a state
            as would form the most favourable environment for their pursuits and the most stable foundation for their leisured life. Thus Greek thought was
            saturated with the conception of life as essentially a set of relations between the individual and the city-state of which he formed an integral
            part. The first aim of education was therefore to train the young as citizens.</p>
          <p>This training must, of necessity, be of a specific kind; for, like other small communities, the Greek city-states showed a life fundamentally one
            in conception, under various specific forms. Each state had its special character, and to this character the education given in it must conform if
            it were to be an effective instrument for training the citizens. From these fundamental conceptions flowed the demands of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> that
            education should be regulated in all its details by the state authority, should be compulsory on all free citizens, and should be uniform—at any
            rate in its earlier stages—for all. In <bibl><title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Republic_(Plato)"><hi rend="italic">the
                Republic</hi></title> and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laws_(dialogue)"><hi rend="italic">the Laws</hi></title>, <author><name
                  type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name></author></bibl> shows to what extreme lengths theory may go when it
            neglects to take account of some of the most pertinent facts of life. For the guardian-citizens of the ideal state family life and family ties are
            abolished; no lower community is to be allowed to enter into competition with the state. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, indeed, did not go to these extreme lengths; he allowed the family to remain, but he
            seems to have regarded it as likely to affect children more for evil than for good.</p>
          <p>In the essential principles laid down by both philosophers as to the relation of the state to education, and in the corollaries they drew from that
            relation, they were not at variance with the accepted Greek theory on the subject. It is true that the actual practice of Greek states departed,-and
            often widely, from this ideal, for, especially in later centuries, the Greek always tended to live his own life. The nearest approach to the theory
            was found in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta">Sparta</name>, where the end of the state as a military organization was
            kept steadily in view, and where, after early childhood, the young citizens were trained directly by the state in a kind of barrack life—the boys to
            become warriors, the girls the mothers of warriors. It was this feature of Spartan education, together with the rude simplicity of life it enforced,
            which attracted <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name>, and, to a less extent, <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> there
            had of old been state laws insisting on the attendance of the children of the free citizens at school, and, in some degree, regulating the schools
            themselves. But at the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> these had fallen into desuetude, and the
            state directly concerned itself only with the training of the ephebi, for which, we learn from <bibl><author><name type="person"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name></author><title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitution_of_the_Athenians"
                  ><hi rend="italic">Constitution of Athens</hi></title></bibl>, somewhat elaborate provisions were made by the appointment of officers, and the
            regulation of both intellectual and physical pursuits. For children and youths under the ephebic age there was no practical regulation of schools or
            palaestra by the state. Yet there is no doubt that the education really given was in conformity with Athenian ideals of culture and life, and that
            it was generally received by the children of free citizens, though of course the sons of the wealthy, then as now, could and did continue their
            attendance at school to a later age than their poorer brethren. The education of girls was essentially a domestic training. What <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, with
            the theorist's love of official systematic regulation, regarded as the greatest defect of Athenian education was in reality its strongest point. In
            practice, the harmony between individual liberty and social claims was much more nearly attained under a system of free working out of common
            thoughts and ideals than would have been the case under one of the irresistible imposition from without of a rigid mould.</p>
          <p>The instruments of education everywhere found to be in <pb n="953"/> harmony with the Greek conception of life and culture were essentially
              twofold,—<q>"music"</q> (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">μουσική</hi></foreign>), or literary and artistic culture, for the mind, and
            systematic gymnastic (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><hi rend="italic">γυμναστική</hi></foreign>) for the body. <bibl><author><name type="person"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name></author>, in the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Republic_(Plato)"><hi
                  rend="italic">Republic</hi></title></bibl>, shows that -the latter, as well as the former, affects the character, and doubtless, though not
            formulated, this was generally more or less vaguely felt. But Greek gymnastic was really an individual training, and therefore made only indirectly
            for the aim of cultivating the social bonds of citizenship. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Ancient
              Greece</name> had nothing corresponding in value in this respect to the organized games which form so important a feature in the school life of
            modern England. The <q>"musical"</q> training was essentially in the national literature and music of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, and this could obviously be carried to very different lengths. The elements of
            mathematical science were also commonly taught. The essential purpose throughout was the development of the character of a loyal citizen of <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name>. As Athenian culture advanced, increasing attention was paid to diagogic
            studies, especially in the ephebic age, with a corresponding decrease of attention to merely physical pursuits; hence the complaints of such
            satirists as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</name> of a growing luxury, effeminacy and corruption
            of youths: complaints apparently based on a comparison of the worst features of the actual present with an idealized and imaginative picture of the
            virtues of the past. Such comparison is, indeed, implicit in much of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> as well as in <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</name>.</p>
          <p>But a disintegrating force was already at work in the educational system of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece"
              >Greece</name> which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> vainly opposed. This was the rhetorical training of the Sophists, the narrowly
            practical and individualistic aim of which was entirely out of harmony with the older Greek ideals of life and culture. In a democratic city-state
            the orator easily became a demagogue, and generally oratory was the readiest path to influence and power. Thus oratory opened the way to personal
            ambition, and young men who were moved by that passion eagerly attended the Sophist schools where their dominant motive was strengthened.</p>
          <p>Further, the closer relations between the Greek states, both in nearer and farther <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Hellas</name>, led naturally to the diminution of differences between civic ideals, and, as a
            consequence, to a more cosmopolitan conception of higher education. This process was completed by the loss of political independence of the
            city-states under the Macedonian domination. Henceforth, higher education became purely intellectual, and its relation to political and social life
            increasingly remote. This, combined with the growing rhetorical tendency already noticed, accounts for the sterility of Greek thought during the
            succeeding centuries. The means of higher education were, indeed, more fully organized. The university of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> was the outcome of a fusion of the private philosophical schools with the state
            organization for the training of the ephebi, and there were other such centres of higher culture, especially in after years at <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, where the contact of Greek thought with the religions and philosophies of <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</name> and the East gave birth in time to the more or less mystical
            philosophies which culminated in Neo-platonism. But at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> itself thought
            became more and more sterile, and education more and more a mere training in unreal rhetoric, till the dissolution of the university by <name

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>, Greek education had lost that reality which is drawn from intimate relation to
            civic life, and the fashionable individualistic schools of philosophy could do nothing to replace the loss. It was, then, an education which had
            largely lost its life-springs that was transferred to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>. In the earlier
            centuries of the republic, Roman education was given entirely in family and public life. The father had unlimited power over his son's life, and was
            open to public censure if he failed to train him in the ordinary moral, civic and religious duties. But it is doubtful if there were any schools
            (q.v.), and it is certain there was no national literature to furnish an instrument of culture. A Roman boy learnt to reverence the gods, to read,
            to bear himself well in manly exercises, and to know enough of the laws of his country to regulate his conduct. This last he acquired directly by
            hearing his father decide the cases of his clients every morning in his hall. The rules of courtesy he learnt similarly by accompanying his father
            to the social gatherings to which he was invited. Thus early Roman education was essentially practical, civic and moral, but its intellectual
            outlook was extremely narrow.</p>

        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Hellenized Roman education</hi></hi></head>
          <p>When a wider culture was imported from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name> it was, however, the form
            rather than the spirit of true Hellenic education that was transferred. This was, indeed, to some extent inevitable from the decadent state of Greek
            education at the time, but it was accentuated by the essentially practical character of the Roman mind. The instrument of education first introduced
            was Greek literature, much of which was soon translated into Latin. In time the schools of the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
                >grammatici</hi></foreign>, teaching grammar and literature, were supplemented by schools of rhetoric and philosophy, though the philosophy
            taught in them was itself little more than rhetorical declamation. These furnished the means of higher culture for those youths who did not study at
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name> or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens"
              >Athens</name>, and were also preparatory to studies at those universities. Under <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Empire</name> the rhetorical schools were gradually organized into a state system, the general
            principles of administration being laid down by imperial decree, and even such details as the appointment and rate of payment of the professors, at
            first left to the municipalities, being in time assumed by the central government. There is no evidence of any state regulation or support of the
            lower schools. This widening of culture affected both boys and girls, the domestic education of the latter being supplemented by a study of
            literature. But it is the higher training in rhetoric which is especially characteristic of Hellenized Roman education.</p>
          <p>The conception of a rhetorical culture is seen at its best in <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian"
                  >Quintilian</name></author>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Institutio oratoria</hi></title></bibl>, the most systematic treatise on education
            produced by the ancient world. With <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> the ideal of an orator was a
            widely cultured, wise and honourable man. And at first the teaching of rhetoric undoubtedly made for higher and true culture. But with the
            autocracy, soon passing into tyranny, of the empire, rhetoric ceased to be a preparation for real life. The true function of oratory is to persuade
            a free people. When it cannot be applied to this purpose it becomes little more than a means of intellectual frivolity, or, at the best, an
            exhibition of cultured ingenuity. Under the empire a rhetorical training was, indeed, turned in not a few instances to practical but most unworthy
            uses by the delators ; a result made possible by the legal system which rewarded delation with a considerable portion of the estate of the
            condemned. Even apart from this, the education in rhetoric had an increasingly evil effect both on the culture and on the character of the higher
            classes in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman empire</name>. Out of real connexion with life as it
            was, it sought its subjects in the realms of the fanciful and the trivial, and with unreality of topic went of necessity deterioration of style. The
            vivid presentment of living thought gave way to that inflated and bombastic abuse of meretricious ornament and far-fetched metaphor in which human
            speech is always involved when it sets forth ideas, or shadows of ideas, which grow out of no conviction in the speaker and are expected to carry no
            conviction to the hearer. Imitation of the form of great models, without the substance of thought which underlay them, led to a general unreality
            and essential falseness of mental life. Further, the continual gazing with admiration on the productions of the past, and the conception of
            excellence as consisting in closeness of imitation, induced a servile attitude of mind towards authority in all too close agreement with the
            political servility which marked the Roman court. Such an attitude was essentially hostile to mental initiative, and thus rhetoric became not merely
            an art of expression but a type of character.</p>
          <p>Nor was there anything in the general conditions of society to counterbalance the ill effects of school and university education. <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> lamented that, even in his time, the old Roman family education by
            example was corrupted; and the moral degradation of later times, though it has doubtless been exaggerated, was certainly real and widespread. Nor
            does the <pb n="954"/> religious revival of Paganism which synchronized with the early centuries of Christianity appear to have effected any reform
            in life. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, the birthplace of Neo-platonism and the intellectual
            centre of the later empire, was also a very sink of moral obliquity.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Christianity and Pagan education</hi></hi></head>
          <p>It was into such a decaying civilization, which by its want of vitality sterilized education, oppressing it under the weight of a dead tradition,
            that Christianity brought new life. Of course, careful instruction in the Faith was given in catechetical schools, of which that at <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexandria">Alexandria</name> was the most famous. But the question as to the attitude of Christians
            towards the ordinary classical culture was important. On the one hand, literature was saturated with Paganism, and the Pagan festivals formed a
            regular part of school life. On the other hand, the Pagan education offered the only means of higher culture, and thus furnished the only weapon
            with which Christians could successfully meet their controversial antagonists. Quite at first, no doubt, when the converts to the new faith were few
            and obscure, the question scarcely arose; but as men of culture and position were attracted to the Church it became urgent. The answers given by the
            Christian leaders were various, and largely the outcome of temperament and previous training. The Greek Fathers, especially <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clement_of_Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</name> (150-217) and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Origen">Origen</name> (185-253), regarded Christianity as essentially the culmination of philosophy, to which the
            way must be found through liberal culture. Without a liberal education the Christian could live a life of faith and obedience but could not attain
            an intellectual understanding of the mysteries of the Faith. On the other hand, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian"
              >Tertullian</name> (160-240) was very suspicious of Pagan culture; though he granted the necessity of employing it as a means of education, yet he
            did so with regret, and would forbid Christians to teach it in the public schools, where some recognition of Paganism would be implied. The general
            practice of the Christians, however, did not conform to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian">Tertullian</name>'s
            exhortations. Indeed, many of the cultivated Christians of the 3rd and 4th centuries were little more than nominal adherents to the Faith, and the
            intercourse between Christian and Pagan was often close and friendly. The general attitude of Christians towards the traditional education is
            evidenced by the protest raised against the edict of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Julian_the_Apostate">Julian</name>, which
            forbade them to teach in the public schools. The ultimate outcome seems to be fairly expressed in the writings of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">St Augustine</name> (354-430) and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome">St Jerome</name> (346-420), who held that literary and rhetorical culture is good so long as it is kept
            subservient to the Christian life.</p>
          <p>In another way Greek philosophy exercised an abiding influence over the culture of future ages. The early centuries of Christianity felt the need
            of formulating the Faith to preserve it from disintegration into a mass of fluid opinions, and such formulation was of necessity made under the
            influence of the philosophy in which the early Fathers had been trained—that Neo-platonism which was the last effort of Paganism to attain a
            conception of life and of God. In the West, this formulation had to be translated into Latin, for Greek was no longer generally understood in Italy,
            and thus the juristic trend of Roman thought also became a factor in the exposition of Christian doctrine. This formulation of the Faith was one of
            the chief legacies the transition centuries passed on to <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle
            ages</name>.</p>
          <p>Had classical culture been less formal than it was during the early centuries of Christianity, the innate antagonism of the Pagan and Christian
            views of life and character must have been so apparent that the education which prepared for the one could not have been accepted by the other. It
            was only because rhetorical culture was so emphatically intellectual, and so little, if at all, moral in its aims, that its inherent opposition to
            the Christian conception of character was not obvious. That its antagonistic influence was not inoperative is shown by the not infrequent
            perversions of cultured Christians to Paganism. But generally the opposition was so obscured that the ethical writings of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ambrose">St Ambrose</name> (340-397) are largely Stoic in conception and reasoning. Yet the Pagan ideal of life,
            especially as it had been developed in the individualistic ethics which had prevailed for more than six centuries, was antithetical in essence to
            that of the Christian Church. The former was essentially an ethics of self-reliance and self-control showing itself in moderation and proportion in
            all expressions of life. An essential feature in such a character was high-mindedness and a self-respect which was of the nature of pride. On the
            contrary, Christian teaching exalted humility as one of the highest virtues, and regarded pride and self-confidence as the deadliest of sins. It
            recognized no doctrine of limitation; what was to be condemned could not be abhorred too violently, nor could what was good be too strongly desired
            or too ardently sought. The highest state attainable by man was absorption in loving ecstasy in the mystic contemplation of God. The practical
            attempt to realize this gave rise to monasticism, with its minutely regulated life expressing unlimited obedience and the renunciation of private
            will at every moment. The monastic life was regarded as the nearest approach to the ideal which a Christian could make on earth. Naturally, as this
            conception gathered strength in generations nurtured in it, the value of classical culture became less and less apparent, and by the time of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Gregory_I">St Gregory the Great</name> (d. 604) the use of classical literature except as
            means of an education having quite another end than classical culture was discouraged.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Modification of Latin</hi></hi></head>
          <p>During these same centuries another process had been advancing with accelerating steps. This was the modification of the Latin language. In the
            early centuries of Christianity literary Latin was already very different from colloquial Latin, especially in the provinces; and, as has been said,
            the literary output of the last age of Paganism was marked by sterility of thought and meretricious redundancy of expression. On the other hand, the
            writings of Christianity show a real living force seeking to find appropriate expression in new forms. Thus, with Christian writers, slavish
            imitation of the past gradually gave way to the evolution of a new and living Latin, which showed itself more and more regardless of classical
            models. To express the new ideas to which Christianity gave birth fresh words were coined, or borrowed from colloquial speech or from the Hebrew and
            Greek Scriptures. This Christian Latin was a real living instrument of expression, which conformed itself in its structure much more closely to the
            mode of thought and expression of actual life than did the artificial imitation of antiquity in which the literary productions of Paganism were
            clothed. It is the Latin in which <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jerome">St Jerome</name></author> wrote <title
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vulgate">the Vulgate</title></bibl>. But with the obscuring of culture during the barbarian invasions this
            current Latin became more and more oblivious of even such elements of form as grammatical inflexions and concords.</p>

          <p>It was to the reformation of this corrupt Latin by a return to classical models, and to the more general spread of culture, especially among clergy
            and nobles, that <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carolingian_Renaissance">the Carolingian revival</name> addressed itself. The
            movement was essentially practical and conservative. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcuin">Alcuin</name> (735-804), who was
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>'s educational adviser and chief executive officer in
            scholastic matters, was probably the best scholar of his time, and himself loved the classical writings with which he was acquainted , but the
            text-books he wrote were but imperfect summaries of existing compendia, and the intellectual condition of his pupils forbade a very generous
            literary diet even had he thought it desirable, of which there is some doubt. The most valuable outcome of the movement was the establishment <pb
              n="955"/> of the palace school, and of bishops' schools and monastic schools throughout the empire. Of these the latter were the most important,
            and each of the chief monasteries had from the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name> an
            external school for pupils not proposing to enter the order as well as an internal school for novices. Thus, the educational system north of the
            Alps was pre-eminently ecclesiastical in its organization and profoundly religious in its aims. For two centuries the new intellectual life was
            obscured by the troubled times which followed the death of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name>, but
            the learning which <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carolingian_Renaissance">the Carolingian revival</name> had restored was
            preserved here and there in cathedral and monastic schools, and the sequence of well-educated ecclesiastics was never altogether interrupted.</p>

            in the doctrines of the Church, the early fathers, and the Scriptures. Theology was as yet not organized into a philosophical system : that was the
            great work <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> had to perform. The seven liberal arts (divided
            into the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Trivium</hi></foreign>—grammar, dialectic, rhetoric; and the more advanced <foreign xml:lang="la"
                ><hi rend="italic">Quadririum</hi></foreign>— geometry, arithmetic, music, astronomy) were a legacy from old Roman education through the

          <p>The scope of the arts was wider than their names would suggest in modern times. Under grammar was included the study of the content and form of
            literature; and in practice the teaching varied from a liberal literary culture to a dry and perfunctory study of just enough grammar to give some
            facility in the use of Latin. Dialectic was mainly formal logic. Rhetoric covered the study of law, as well as composition in prose and verse.
            Geometry was rather what is now understood by geography and natural history, together with the medicinal properties of plants. Arithmetic, with the
            cumbrous Roman notation, included little more than the simplest practical calculations required in ordinary life and the computation of the
            calendar. Music embraced the rules of the plain-song of the Church, some theory of sound, and the connexion of harmony and numbers. Astronomy dealt
            with the courses of the heavenly bodies, and was seldom kept free from astrology. In philosophy the current text-books were <bibl>the <title

          <p>It is evident that though such a scheme of studies might in practice, during ages of intellectual stagnation and general ignorance, be arid in the
            extreme, it was capable in time of revival of giving scope to the widest extension of culture. It was, indeed, at once comprehensive and unified in
            conception, and well adapted to educate for the perfectly definite and clear view of life which the Church set before men.</p>

          <p>In the 11th century Europe had settled down, after centuries of war and invasion, into a condition of comparative political stability,

            towns of Italy, raised as defences against the pressure of Saracen and Hungarian invasions. Soon, communication with the East by trade and in the
            Crusades, and with the highly cultivated <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moors">Moors</name> in Spain, further stimulated the
            new burst of intellectual life. Arabic renderings of some of the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle"
              >Aristotle</name> and commentaries on them were translated into Latin and exercised a profound influence on the trend of culture. A new

            real <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> was known that it was found possible to bring the Peripatetic
            philosophy into the service of theology.</p>
          <p>There were thus two broad stages in the educational revival commonly known as scholasticism. In the first the controversies were essentially
            metaphysical, and centred round the question of the nature of universals; the orthodox theological party generally supporting realism, or the
            doctrine that the universal is the true reality, of which particulars and individuals are only appearances ; while the opposite doctrine of
            nominalism—that universals are <q>" mere sounds "</q> and particulars the only true existences—showed a continual disposition to lapse into heresies
            on the most fundamental doctrines of the Church. The second stage was essentially constructive; the opposition of philosophy to theology was
            negated, and philosophy gave a systematic form to theology itself. The most characteristic figure of the former period was <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Abelard">Abelard</name> (1079-1142), of the latter <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St Thomas Aquinas</name> (1225-1274). The former knew little of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> beyond the translations and adaptations of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anicius_Manlius_Severinus_Boethius">Boethius</name>, but he was essentially a dialectician who applied his logic
            to investigating the fundamental doctrines of the Church and bringing everything to the bar of reason. This innate rationalism appeared to bring
            theology under the sway of philosophy, and led to frequent condemnations of his doctrines as heretical. With <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">St Thomas</name>, on the other hand, the essential dogmas of Christianity must be unquestioned.

            the Church systematized in a mould derived from the Aristotelian philosophy.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Scholastic education</hi></hi></head>
          <p>It is evident, then, that during the period of the scholastic revival, men's interests were specially occupied with questions concerning the
            spiritual and the unseen, and that the great instrument of thought was syllogistic logic, by which consequences were deduced from premises received
            as unquestionably true. There was a general acceptance of the authority of the Church in matters of belief and conduct, and of that of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, as approved by the Church, in all that related to knowledge of this
            world.</p>
          <p>Before the rediscovery of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> exerted such a general influence on the
            form of education, there was a real revival of classical literary culture at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chartres"

                  Salisbury</name></author> (d. 1182) in his <title><hi rend="italic">Metalogicus</hi></title></bibl> advocated literature as an instrument of
            education and lamented the barrenness of a training confined to the subtleties of formal logic. But the recrudescence of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> accelerated the movement in favour of dialectic, though at the same time it furnished
            topics on which logic could be exercised which only a bare materialism can esteem unimportant. The weaknesses of the general educational system
            which grew up within scholasticism were that haste to begin dialectic led to an undue curtailment of previous liberal culture, and that exclusive
            attention to philosophical and theological questions caused a neglect of the study of the physical world and a disregard of the critical functions
            of the intellect. Doubtless there were exceptions, of which perhaps the most striking is the work in physical science done at <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name> (1214-1294). But <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albertus_Magnus">Albertus Magnus</name> (1193-1280), the master of <name type="person"

            liberal literary <pb n="956"/> culture was by no means unknown. Always there were such examples. But too often boys hastened to enter upon dialectic
            and philosophy as soon as they had acquired sufficient smattering of colloquial Latin to engage in the disputes of the schools. A deterioration of
            Latin was the unavoidable consequence of such premature specialization. The seven liberal arts were often not pursued in their entirety, and
            students remained satisfied with desiccated compendia of accepted opinions. Thus the encyclopaedias of general information which were in general use
            during <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> show little or no advance in positive knowledge upon

          <p>The services of scholasticism to the cause of education, however, cannot well be overestimated, and the content of scholastic studies was in
            fundamental harmony with the intellectual interests of the time. Above all other benefits owed by future ages to scholasticism is the foundation of
            the universities of western Europe. The intellectual activity of the 11th century led everywhere to a great increase in the number of scholars
            attending the monastic and cathedral schools. Round famous teachers, such as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Abelard"
              >Abelard</name>, gathered crowds of students from every country. In the 12th century the need for organizing such bodies of teachers and students
            was imperative, and thus the earlier universities arose in Italy, France and England, not by deliberate foundation of secular or ecclesiastical
            ruler, but as spontaneous manifestations of the characteristic medieval impulse to organize into institutions. Afterwards, charters conferring
            powers and privileges were sought from both Church and state, but these only confirmed the selfgoverning character the universities had borne from
            the first. Each of the early universities was a specialized school of higher study: <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Salerno">Salerno</name> was a school of medicine; <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Bologna">Bologna</name> was the centre of that revival of Roman law which wrought so profound an
            effect upon the legal systems of France and Germany towards the close of the medieval period. But the greatest of medieval universities was that of
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, emphatically the home of philosophy and theology, which was the model
            upon which many other universities, including <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and
              <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>, were organized.</p>
          <p>The German universities were of later origin, the earliest being <name type="institution"

            ; for nearly all were founded by the civic authority, and then obtained the recognition of the Church and charters from the emperor.</p>

          <p>The concentration of higher instruction in universities was not antagonistic to the medieval conception of the Church as the teacher of mankind.
            University life was modelled on that of the closter, though the monastic ideal could not be fully realized, and the scholars not infrequently
            exhibited considerable licence in life. This was inevitable with the very large numbers of the scholars and the great variations of age among them.
            Moreover students, and to a less extent teachers, passed from university to university, so that the universities of medieval Europe formed a free
            confederacy of learning in close relation to the Church but untrammelled by state control. Nevertheless, they were less definitely ecclesiastical
            than the cathedral seminaries which they largely supplanted, and the introduction of studies derived from <name type="people"

          <p>The scheme of instruction was arranged on the assumption that special studies should be based on a wide general culture. Thus of the four faculties
            into which university teaching was organized, that of arts, with its degrees of Baccalaureat and Magister, was regarded as propaedeutic to those of
            theology, law and medicine. It often included, indeed, quite young boys, for the distinction between grammar school and university was not clearly
            drawn. Attention was concentrated on those subjects which treat of man and his relations to his fellow-men and to God, and no attempt was made to
            extend the bounds of knowledge. The aim was to pass on a body of acquired knowledge regarded as embracing all that was possible of attainment, and
            the authority of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> in physics as well as in philosophy, and of <name

              >Hippocrates</name> in medicine was absolute. The methods of instruction—by lecture, or commentary on received texts; and by disputation, in which
            the scholars acquired dexterity in the use of the knowledge they had absorbed—were in harmony with this conception, and were undoubtedly thoroughly
            well suited to the requirements of an age in which the ideal of human thought was not discovery but order, and in which knowledge was regarded as a
            set of established propositions, the work of reason being to harmonize these propositions in subordination to the authoritative doctrines of the
            Church.</p>

          <p>Such an extension of the means of higher education as was given by the universities was naturally accompanied by a corresponding increase in
            schools of lower rank. Not only were there grammar schools at cathedral and collegiate churches, but many others were founded in connexion with
            chantries, and by some of the many gilds into which medieval middle-class life organized itself. The Dominican and Franciscan friars were
            enthusiastic promoters of learning both in universities and in schools, and in the Netherlands <name type="institution"

            promotion of learning by the multiplication of manuscripts as another. The curriculum was represented broadly by the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi
                rend="italic">Trivium</hi></foreign>. The greatest attention was paid to grammar, which included very various amounts of reading of classical
            and Christian authors, the most commonly included being <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virgil">Virgil</name>, parts of <name

            years. In rhetoric <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name></author>'s <title
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/De_Oratore"><hi rend="italic">De oratore</hi></title></bibl> was read, and dialectic was practised, as in the
            universities, by means of disputations.</p>
          <p>In addition to the grammar schools were writing and song schools of an elementary type, in which instruction was usually in the vernacular. Girls
            were taught in women's monasteries and in the home, and those of the upper classes at least very generally learned to read, write and keep accounts,
            as well as fine needlework, household duties and management, and such elementary surgery and medicine as served in cases of slight daily accidents
            and illnesses. Even those boys and girls who did not receive formal scholastic instruction were instructed orally by the parish priests in the
            doctrines and duties of the Faith ; while the pictures and statues with which the churches were adorned aided the direct teaching of sermons and
            catechizing in giving a general knowledge of <title>Bible</title> history and of the legends of the saints.</p>
          <p>No doubt, in times of spiritual and intellectual lethargy, the practice fell short of the theory ; but on the whole it may be concluded that in
            medieval times the provision for higher instruction was adequate to the demand, and that, relatively to the culture of the time, the mass of the
            people were by no means sunk in brutish ignorance. Indeed, especially when the paucity of books before the invention of printing is borne in mind,
            the number of people who could read the vernacular, as evidenced by the demand for books in the vulgar tongue as soon as printing made them
            available, is clear proof that the latter part of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> was by no

          <p>Feudalism, the other characteristic aspect of medieval society, had also its system of education, expressing its own view of life, and preparing
            for the adequate performance of its duties. This was the training in chivalry given to pages and squires in the halls and castles of the great.
                <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Hallam">Hallam</name> has well said : <quote>" There are, if I may so say, three

                energies of mankind. These are the spirits of liberty, of religion and of honour. It was the principal business of chivalry to animate and

            went on side by side <pb n="957"/> with it. Throughout chivalry was sanctified by the offices of the Church. The education of chivalry aimed at
            fitting the noble youth to be a worthy knight, a just and wise master, and a prudent manager of an estate. Much was acquired by daily experience of
            a knightly household, but in addition the page received direct instruction in reading and writing; courtly amusements, such as chess and playing the
            lute, singing and making verses; the rules and usages of courtesy; and the knightly conception of duty. As a squire he practised more assiduously
            the knightly exercises of war and peace, and in the management of large or small bodies of men he attained the capacity of command.</p>

          <p>With the unification of existing knowledge and the systematization of theology the constructive work of scholasticism was done. At the same time
            the growth of national feeling was slowly but surely undermining feudalism. Moreover, deep resentment was accumulating throughout western Europe
            against the practical abuses which had become prevalent in the Church, and especially in the court of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name> and in the prince-bishoprics of Germany. In short, Europe was out-growing medieval
            institutions, which appeared more and more as empty forms unable to satisfy the needs and longings of the human soul. In such conditions, the
            customary and traditional education of school and university tended to lose touch more and more completely with the new aspirations and views of
            life which were everywhere gathering adherents among the keenest and most active intellects. Had a new cultural movement not begun, the education of
            Europe threatened to become as arid as the rhetorical education of the last centuries of <name type="institution"

          <p>Italy, by its greater wealth and its more intimate commerce with the eastern empire, was the seed-plot of this new tree of knowledge. Ever since
            the 11th century the cities of northern Italy had been in advance of Europe beyond the Alps both in culture and in material progress. The old
            classical spirit and the feeling of Roman citizenship had never quite died out, and <bibl>the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Divine_Comedy"
                  ><hi rend="italic">Divina Commedia</hi></title> of <author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri"
                >Dante</name></author></bibl> (1265-1321) furnishes evidence that the poet of the scholastic philosophical theology was also a keen student and
            lover of the old Latin poets. But the greatest impulse to the revived study of the classics was given by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrarch">Petrarch</name> (1304-1374) and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giovanni_Boccaccio">Boccaccio</name> (1313-1375). Generally throughout western Europe the 14th century, though
            full of war and political unrest, was a time of considerable intellectual activity, shown in the increase of schools and universities, as well as in
            the literary and artistic revival in Italy, in the social and theological movement in England and Bohemia associated with the names of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Wycliffe">Wycliffe</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jan_Hus"
              >Huss</name>, and in the more or less perfect substitution of Roman law everywhere except in England for the law of custom which had hitherto
            prevailed.</p>
          <p>But it was the literary movement which most affected education, and indeed the whole life of Europe. A decisive step was taken when <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manuel_Chrysoloras">Manuel Chrysoloras</name> was invited to teach Greek in <name
              type="institution">the university of Florence</name> in 1397. The enthusiasm for classical culture, to which <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petrarch">Petrarch</name> had given so great an impetus, fathered force and extended over the whole of Italy,
            though, of course, felt only by a select few and leaving the mass of the people little, if at all, affected. From Italy it spread gradually to
            countries north of the Alps. In the old writers men found full expression of that new spirit of self-conscious freedom which was vaguely striving
            for expression throughout the whole of Christendom. In the free political atmosphere of the Italian communes, with their wealthy and leisured
            merchant class, that spirit could flourish much more readily than in the feudalized Europe across the Alps. Moreover, the antique spirit was in
            direct line of ancestry with that of medieval Italy. Thus, for a couple of centuries, Italy stood in the van of European culture.</p>
          <p>The stages of the movement cannot be traced here: suffice it to say it showed itself especially in an enthusiastic search for manuscripts, followed
            by their multiplication and wider distribution; in an intense devotion to literary form; in a revival of classic taste in architecture; in a
            wonderful development of painting and sculpture from symbolism of spiritual qualities towards naturalism and romanticism ; in a return to Platonism
            in philosophy; in a contempt, often unreasoning and wanting a foundation in knowledge, for the scholastic Aristotelian philosophy itself, and not
            simply for the trivialities into which its actual exercise had so commonly degenerated. The invention of printing necessarily gave the movement both
            a stronger and a wider influence than it could otherwise have attained. And in its search after knowledge it was in full harmony with the spirit of
            adventure which marked the age, and by the discovery of the New World wrought so profound a change in the relative importance and prosperity of the
            countries of western Europe.</p>

        <div type="article">

          <p>It is the spirit of the movement which is of interest to the student of education. And that spirit was essentially one of opposition to authority
            and of assertion of individual liberty, which worked itself out in various forms among peoples of different temperaments. In Italy the form was
            literary and artistic, and the full development of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the Renaissance</name> spirit
            was seen in a practical Paganism which substituted the attractions of art for the claims of religion and morality, and eventuated in deep and
            widespread immorality and a contemptuous tolerance of the outward observances of religion without faith in the doctrines they symbolized. The
            movement became an attempt to reconstitute the past intellectual life of Italy, and, as such, was foredoomed to sterility as soon as the work of
            re-discovery was completed; for the revived forms were not inspired with the vital spirit which had once made them realities, and consequently men's
            minds once again were occupied with mere verbal subtleties. The really valuable service of the Italian humanists to Europe was the restoration to
            man of the heritage of knowledge which he had allowed to slip from his grasp, and the leading the way to a freer intellectual atmosphere. In Germany
            the spirit manifested itself in a rebellion against the doctrinal system of the Church as the only effectual means of attaining reform of
            ecclesiastical abuses. The Protestant reformation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> was the real
            German outcome of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the Renaissance</name>. In no other country of Europe did the
            movement take so distinctive a form.</p>
          <p>It was, then, not merely the revival of interest in classical studies which so profoundly affected the life and education of western Europe. It was
            rather that in those literatures men found a response to intellectual and moral cravings which had been blindly gathering force for generations, and
            which found themselves formulated and objectified in the writings which set forth the Pagan view of life with its assumption of the essential worth
            and self-reliance of the individual and its frank delight in all the pleasures of existence. It was, in short, in proportion as men not only found
            delight in Pagan literature but returned in essence to the Pagan view of individual worth and the supremacy of the human intellect, that the Church
            realized the danger to herself which lurked in the new movement.</p>
          <p>At first the revival of interest in the classical literatures did not show any antagonism to Catholic faith and practice, and its warmest
            supporters were faithful sons of the Church. The view of the relation of classical literature to Christianity adopted by the great humanist
            schoolmaster <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vittorino_da_Feltre">Vittorino da Feltre</name> (1378-1446) was broadly that of
            the early Fathers, and in his school at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantua">Mantua</name> he showed that culture was not
            inconsistent with loyalty to the Church or with purity of life. With him classical literature was not the end and sum of education, but was a means
            of implanting ideas, of developing taste, and of acquiring knowledge, all as helps and ornaments of a Christian life. Though Pagan literature was
            the means of education, the Pagan spirit had not supplanted that of Christianity. The school at <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mantua">Mantua</name> may, indeed, be said to have exhibited in practice a Christianized application of the
            doctrines of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quintilian">Quintilian</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plutarch">Plutarch</name>.</p>
          <p>So was it in the other countries of Christendom. In the Netherlands <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brethren_of_the_Common_Life">the Brethren of the Common Life</name> introduced humanistic studies into their

            combined with devotion to the Church was seen in <name type="person">Selling</name>, prior of <name type="institution">Christ Church</name>, <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canterbury">Canterbury</name>, the first real English humanist, in <name type="person"

            loyalty to Catholicism. It seemed, then, at first as if the greatest educational effect of the classical revival would be the deepening of literary
            culture, and the substitution of real inquiry for dialectic subtleties in the courses of schools and universities, without any break with
            established religious teaching. It is true that the majority of schools were but little affected, and many of the universities had given but a
            half-hearted welcome to humanistic studies when the religious revolt in Germany under the leadership of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> threw the whole of Europe into two hostile camps. But even the conservative <name

          <p>The immediate effect of the religious controversies of the 16th century on education was emphatically, if unintentionally, disastrous. The
            secularization of ecclesiastical property too often absorbed the endowments of the schools, so that, both in Germany and in England, the majority of
            grammar schools either disappeared or continued a starved existence with diminished funds; the doctrine of salvation by faith alone and the futility
            of good works dried up the source from which such endowments had flowed; the violent fulminations of the German reformers against the universities
            as the homes of the hated scholastic theology and philosophy found an echo in minds fired with the renaissance enthusiasm for poetry and oratory,
            and correlative distaste for the more severe and abstract speculations of logic and philosophy, which expressed itself in abstention from those
            seats of learning ; the preoccupation of men's minds with theological speculations and quarrels led those few who did resort to the universities to
            neglect their appointed studies and to devote their energies to interminable wrangling over the points in dispute. This decadence in culture was
            attended by an outbreak of licence and immorality, especially among the young, which called forth violent denunciations from <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> and many of his followers in Germany, and from <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugh_Latimer">Latimer</name> and other reformers in England. In some respects these results were only transitory.
            Humanism and Protestantism, which had so far diverged that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name>
            (1467-1536) had declared that where Lutheranism flourished learning decayed, were brought together again by <name type="person"

          <p>Moreover, the schools established a tradition of curriculum and instruction which ignored the new directions of men's thoughts and the new view of
            knowledge as something to be enlarged, and not merely a deposit to be handed down from generation to generation. The later humanist theories of
            education, which the schools continued to follow generally for over two centuries, and in many cases for another hundred years after that, were
            drawn mainly from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiderius_Erasmus">Erasmus</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon">Melanchthon</name>, who found in the classical languages and literatures, and especially in
            Latin, the only essential instruments of education. General knowledge of natural facts might be desirable to the cultured man as ornaments to his
            rhetoric, but it was to be sought in the writings of antiquity. Even so revolutionary a thinker on education as <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Rabelais">Rabelais</name> (1495-1553) with all his demand for an encyclopaedic curriculum, held the

            which had degraded it, was restored, and continued to satisfy the longings of minds which felt the need of an authoritative harmonizing of faith and
            knowledge. Everywhere the society established schools, which, by their success in teaching and the mildness of their discipline, attracted thousands
            of pupils who came even from Protestant homes. Their curriculum was purely classical, but it was elaborated with much skill, and the methods of
            instruction and discipline were made the subject of much thought and of long-continued experiment. In the methods thus determined all Jesuit fathers
            were trained, so that the teachers in Jesuit schools attained a degree of skill in their art which was too generally wanting elsewhere.</p>

          <p>So long as Latin remained the language of learning, and new fields of knowledge were not appropriated, the schools remained in harmony with the
            culture of their time, though, as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Mulcaster">Mulcaster</name> (1530-1611) pointed out,
            such a training was not of value to the majority of boys. For them he urged an elementary education in the vernacular; but neither in this nor in
            his advocacy of the training of teachers was his advice followed.</p>
          <p>In the 17th century the dislocation between the Latin schools and the needs of life began to be accentuated as Latin gradually ceased to be the
            language of learning ; and, as a consequence, the numbers attending the schools decreased, and the mass of the people sunk continually lower in
            ignorance. In vain <name type="person">Hoole</name> urged the establishment of a universal system of elementary schools giving instruction in the
            vernacular, <name type="person">Petty</name> put forth his plan for elementary trade schools, and Cowley proposed the establishment of a college
            devoted to research. Ideas of reform were in the air, but the main current of scholastic practice flowed on unaffected by them. Some attention was,
            indeed, paid to the conservative reforms advocated by the Port Royalists, of which the most important was the inclusion of the vernacular as a
            branch of instruction, but the cry for more fundamental changes based on the philosophy of <name type="person"

            set forth his general principles, attracted little attention and won less adherence, though his school books, in which he attempted with very little
            success to apply his principles, were widely used in schools. But these were little more than bald summaries of real and supposed facts, stated in
            Latin and the vernacular in parallel columns. In content they differed from such medieval summaries of knowledge as the well-known work of <name

          <p>In the universities, too, the 16th and 17th centuries saw a continuous decadence. The 16th century was not ripe for real intellectual freedom; and
            Protestantism, having based its revolt on the right of private judgment, soon produced a number of conflicting theological systems, vying with each
            other in rigidity and narrowness, which, as <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Paulsen">Paulsen</name> says,
                <quote>" nearly stifled the intellectual life of the German people."</quote></ref> Further, the idea of national autonomy, which exercised so
            great an effect on the politics of the time, included the universal adherence of the citizens to the religion of the state. Hence, till the end of
            the 17th century the universities of Protestant Europe were regarded mainly as instruments for securing adhesion to the national theological system
            on the part of future clergy and officials, and the state interfered more and more with their organization and work. Theology occupied the most
            important place in the higher studies pursued, which for the rest differed little in content and less in spirit from those of preceding centuries,
            except that more attention was paid to the study of classical literature. Even that decayed into formal linguistics as the Renaissance enthusiasm
            for poetry and oratory died out, and interest in logical and philosophical questions, fostered by the dominance of dogmatic controversial theology,
            again became dominant. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, on the other hand, the faculty of theology had
            decayed through the withdrawal of those preparing for the priesthood into episcopal seminaries, and the higher studies pursued were mainly law and
            medicine. Thus, generally, the universities were less and less fulfilling the function of providing a general liberal education. Another change, due
            to the same causes and making for the same results, was the isolation of universities, often directly fostered by the state governments, which for
            the universal interchange of medieval thought substituted a narrow provincial culture and outlook. It is no wonder that numbers everywhere decayed
            and that complaints as to the habits of the students were loud and frequent.</p>

          <p>At the close of the 17th century, then, universities as well as schools had reached a very low level of efficiency and were held in little respect
            by the cultured. Indeed, from the middle of the century, the main current of intellectual life had drifted away from the orthodox centres of
            learning. The formation of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences">the Berlin Academy</name> in
            Germany and of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Society">the Royal Society</name> in England, and the refusal of
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gottfried_Leibniz">Leibnitz</name> to accept a chair in any German university, were signs of
            the times. In France, and later in Germany, the education of the noble youth was increasingly carried on apart from the schools, and was really an
            outgrowth from the education of chivalry. In the 16th century <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baldassare_Castiglione"
              >Castiglione</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michel_de_Montaigne">Montaigne</name> had advocated a training
            directly adapted to prepare for polite life, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Elyot">Elyot</name> wrote on similar
            lines. But the most important movement in this direction was the formation of the courtly academies which flourished in France in the 17th century,
            and were soon imitated in the <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Ritterakademien</hi></foreign> of Germany. In these schools of the nobility
            French was more honoured than classics, and the other subjects were chosen as directly adapted to prepare for the life of a noble at the court.

            England, though he proposed a curriculum far more extensive than had ever been found possible. More and more, too, foreign travel had, from the
            middle of the 16th century, been looked upon as a better mode of finishing the education of a gentleman than a course at a university.</p>

          <p>Rousseauism, however, was not merely a transitory revolt against a conventionality of life that had become unbearable ; it was emphatically the

            but in that he found the essence of life in the gratification of the desires and impulses of the moment, he enunciated a doctrine which banished
            high principle and strenuous effort from life and consequently from education. In the <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emile:_or,_On_Education"><hi rend="italic">Emile</hi></title> is presented a purely fantastic scheme of education
            based on a psychology of development so crude as to be absolutely false, and producing a young man utterly unable to guide his own life or to
            control his emotions and impulses. Rousseauism is, indeed, in its essence the application to education of the doctrines of naturalism—the philosophy
            which regards human life as a mere continuation of physical process, and consequently as determined wholly by environment. So <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> would abolish all moral training and leave the child to the reactions of

            Church and other voluntary agencies, though aided by the state. Finally a state system of schools has been more or less fully set up in every state
            of western Europe and in America, and subjected to more or less state regulation and control. Equally marked has been the growing care for the
            scholastic education of girls as well as boys, though only in America are the two regarded as practically identical in form and content.</p>
          <p>Thus the 19th century saw the final working out of the idea that the state should be substituted for the Church as the official agent of education,
            an idea which had its roots in the Renaissance conception of the right of man to direct his life apart from theological determinations. The more
            direct outcome of the same idea is apparent in the absolute liberty with which the presuppositions of knowledge are questioned, and the maxim of

          <p>The influence of the same spirit has wrought an equally momentous change in the methods of instruction. The impetus given by the exaggerated
            doctrine of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> to the view that the nature of the child
            should determine the means of education, led to more thorough-going attempts than had hitherto been made to base educational method on a knowledge
            of child psychology. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Fröbel">Froebel</name> (1782-1852), by their insistence on the need of educating a child through his
            own activity, and by their widespread influence, made the new view of method an actuality. The influence of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> has, thus, passed into modern educational practice in a form that, in its
            essence, is true, though in practice it has shown itself apt to run into the same excess of emphasis on impulse and feeling which vitiated the
            teaching of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Rousseau</name> himself. The influence of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Friedrich_Herbart">Herbart</name> (1776-1841) has tended to counteract this. The essence of
            Herbartianism is that mental life consists of presentations, or reactions of the mind on the environment, and that will springs from the circle of
            thought thus developed. The emphasis is therefore placed on intellect and instruction while in Froebelianism it is placed on spontaneous activity
            and on the arrangement of the environment. Each exaggerates the function of the one factor in concrete experience which it makes the centre of
            interest, and each is tinged with the individualistic conception of life which characterized the 18th and early 19th century.</p>

            of various branches of natural science. Conjointly with this has been much increase of specialization, and that not only in the university but in
            the school. There is no longer a universally recognized circle of knowledge constituting a liberal education preparatory to specialist studies, as
            there was in <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. Nor is there general agreement as to what
            such educational institutions as schools and universities should attempt to do, or even as to the end that should be sought by education as a whole.
            Nor can agreement on such points be expected while men differ widely as to the meaning and purpose of life. The work of the organization of the
            material means of education has largely been accomplished by the civilized world: that of determining the true theory and practice of the educative
            process itself is still incomplete. To that, both discussion of the philosophy of life and of the relative values in life, of various kinds of
            experience and experiment in the light of the conclusions reached, are needed. The problem will never be absolutely solved, for that would imply an
            absolutely best education irrespective of conditions, but its practical solution will be reached when a true adjustment is made between the process
            of education and the life for which that education is intended to be a preparation.</p>

          <head type="alt">II. NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION</head>
          <p>A statement of the principles commonly recognized by modern communities as governing the action of the state in relation to education may
            facilitate at the outset a clearer understanding of the problems which the organization of public education presents. The cardinal doctrine of state
            interference in the educational domain is universally accepted by all the great nations of the modern world; and in regard to its extent and limits
            a large measure of agreement has now been reached.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Principles of state interference.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>In the first place, it is recognized as the duty of the state to insist upon a certain minimum of education for every future citizen. This does not
            necessitate a monopoly of education on the part of the state, such as was claimed by the Napoleonic despotism under the traditional (it would seem)
            of the old authoritative Gallo-Roman tradition, transformed in its outward manifestation but not in its inward spirit by the French Revolution. Such
            a monopoly would be plainly repugnant to the spirit of Anglo- Saxon individualism, and it is interesting to note that attempts to reassert it have
            in recent times been repudiated in republican France by some of the best exponents of modern free thought, as an infringement of personal liberty
            not calculated to justify itself by any corresponding public gain. Nevertheless, the recognition of this primary duty of the state plainly implies a
            state system of at least elementary education. The masses of the industrial population cannot afford the necessary minimum of instruction which the
            public interest demands, and private and voluntary effort cannot efficiently supply the want resulting from the unequal distribution of wealth. But
            it is in the nature of things that, so far as private effort attempts anything in this direction, it should be motived in the main by religion and
            associated with the great historical religious organizations; thus it comes about that the moment the state steps in to make good the deficiency of
            voluntary effort a fruitful and embittering source of difficulty and friction is disclosed. Hence, in England, the history of public elementary
            education since the beginning of the 19th century has been very largely the history of what is called the religious difficulty. Here we find
            ourselves in the region of acute controversy in which it is useless to do more than note empirically the various solutions adopted by different
            states. Perhaps all that can safely be indicated as commanding universal acceptance is the principle that the state must not impose upon an
            individual citizen in the person of his child any form of religious instruction to which he conscientiously objects. Modern controversies show the
            difficulty of applying even this rudimentary principle to the complicated circumstances of a free community split up into a number of groups
            differing profoundly in religious sentiment, and zealous each for the recognition of its own ideal within the common system. So far, however, as
            secular instruction (i.e. the teaching of other subjects than religion) is concerned it is now generally accepted that the elementary minimum must
            be both compulsory and free for every individual child whose parents will not or cannot (as the case may be) provide such instruction for it
            efficiently elsewhere than in the state-supported schools.</p>
          <p>Next, the action of the modern state cannot stop short at elementary education. The principle of <q>" the career open to talent "</q> is no longer
            a matter of abstract humanitarian theory, a fantastical aspiration of revolutionary dreamers ; for the great industrial communities of the modern
            world it is a cogent practical necessity imposed by the fierce international competition which prevails in the arts and industries of life. The
            nation that is not to fail in the struggle for commercial success, with all that this implies for national life and civilization, must needs see
            that its industries are fed with a constant supply of workers adequately equipped in respect both of general intelligence and technical
            training.</p>
          <p>On political grounds too, the increasing democratization of <pb n="961"/> institutions renders a wide diffusion of knowledge and the cultivation of
            a high standard of intelligence among the people a necessary precaution of prudent statesmanship, especially for the great imperial states which
            confide the most-momentous issues of world policy to the arbitrament of the popular voice. The state then must satisfy itself that the means of
            education are placed within the reach of all, in grades adapted to the varying degrees of intelligence and educational opportunity to be found among
            a community upon the majority of whose members is imposed the necessity of entering upon the practical business of life at a more or less early age.
            The organization of the higher grades of education constitutes a task of less formidable magnitude than the organization of elementary education,
            for the reason that, at any rate in the prevailing social conditions, it is only a minority who can benefit by it, and that of this minority a large
            proportion can afford the whole or a considerable portion of the cost in each individual case. The class, however, whose education must needs be
            assisted by the state if it is not to remain inefficient must always be considerable ; and account must be taken also of the necessities of the
            further class whose exceptional mental development is such as to make it worth while for the state to bestow gratuitously an education higher than
            elementary at the public expense. University education is distinguished from education of the lower grades by the fact that, being necessarily
            restricted to an elite of intellect or birth, it cannot, save in very exceptional circumstances, usefully be organized locally. Although
            universities are the necessary complement of a public educational system they do not in strictness or necessity form part of such a system, and in
            so far as they are brought within the purview of public authority it must be as a matter of national, rather than municipal or provincial, concern.
            Accordingly university education is separately treated (see UNIVERSITIES), and will not be referred to, save incidentally, in the present
            article.</p>
          <p>Reserving to a final section the history of education in the United States of America, a brief description is given here of the educational systems
            of the leading European countries by way of introduction to a more detailed, but still summary, historical sketch of public education in England.
            The highly organized educational systems of France and Prussia (as representing Germany) are manifestly suitable for the purposes of a general study
            of the principles of educational polity as worked out upon logical and consistently thought-out plans by highly centralized states. As to other
            European countries, a brief mention must suffice of certain features of special interest presented by smaller progressive states of such different
            types as Switzerland, Belgium and Holland. Similarly, in the case of the United Kingdom, considerations of space forbid more than a brief notice of
            the educational systems of Scotland (q.v.) and Ireland (q.v.). For other countries see the sections in the articles under the headings of the
            respective states.</p>

          <p>France (q.v.) presents the most complete type of a state system of education organized under a strongly centralized administration in all grades.
            This centralized administration in education, as in other departments, represents the Napoleonic heritage of the Republic, and, although there has
            been an increasing tendency of recent years to study local conditions in the internal organization of schools, anything approaching to local
            autonomy is unknown in educational affairs: The necessary checks upon bureaucracy are supplied not by popularly elected municipal bodies but by a
            strong infusion of the pedagogic element in the administrative machinery. The pedagogic element in turn does but represent another side of the
            collective activities of the state. The teaching profession both in the primary and higher spheres— and the two are sharply marked off from one
            another—consists of a highly organized body of state functionaries, united by a strong <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">esprit de
              corps</hi></foreign> and actuated by ideals and aims which are inspired by the state. The importance of this condition of things lies in the fact
            that the Republic is something more than a form of government : it is the social and moral expression of the democratic ideal as conceived by a
            people profoundly imbued by tradition with the sense of social sohdarity, or collectivism; and nowhere has this expression been more characteristic
            or more complete than in the domain of public education. Yet the educational system of modern France is by no means exclusively the creation of
              <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Third Republic</name>, and the main stages in its development
            deserve to be traced historically.</p>

            they upheld the method of simultaneous teaching against the partisans of the mutual (or monitorial) method, successfully demonstrating the
            superiority of the trained teacher. The unfortunate effects of the monitorial system upon English education show the reality of the service which
            this religious congregation rendered to the national pedagogy in France.</p>

          <p>The Constitution of 1791 decreed that primary instruction should be compulsory and gratuitous. (It may be explained that the term <q>" free
              education,"</q><foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">instruction libre</hi></foreign>, does not bear the same meaning in France as in England.
            In France a free school means a school not under state control and not forming part of the state system.) In this as in much else the Revolution was
            powerless to do more than enunciate general principles which it left for later generations, in the present instance after the lapse of nearly a
            century, to carry into effect. True to its theories of individualistic liberty, the Revolution admitted liberty of teaching. <name type="person"

              University</name>, thus securing a monopoly of teaching to the state. The Napoleonic idea of the university, doubtless because a true expression
            of the national genius, has never ceased to exert a profound influence upon French education, an influence which of late years has been revivified
            and reinforced by the modern ideal of social solidarity.</p>

            £2,400,000 was set aside for this purpose by the state. In 1879 a law was passed compelling every department to maintain a training college for male

            and delicate topics of the relation of the state school to religion and the value of the substituted moral instruction have recently received
            illuminating and objective treatment from different points of view in the series of reports on <bibl><title><hi rend="italic">Moral Instruction and

                  Sadler</name></editor> (<date>1908</date>, vol. ii.)</bibl>; the barest reference to the questions at issue must here suffice. As regards the
            character of the moral instruction, it would appear to have shifted from a Kantian to a purely sociological basis. Roman Catholic opinion is at
            least not unanimous in regarding the <q>" lay "</q> or neutral school as essentially or necessarily anti-religious, and plainly there is no inherent
            reason why the neutrality should not be a real neutrality, but with the existing relations between the Catholic Church and modern thought in France
            the influence of the Normalist teachers is in fact apt to be anti-religious, and moreover no system of independent moral doctrine, whether based
            upon a priori or inductive reasoning, can be acceptable to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the
              Roman Catholic Church</name>. In whatever degree the blame may be rightly apportionable between church and state, the fact is that the two find
            themselves in acute conflict, and that from the conflict there has resulted a certain moral confusion which Christian and non- Christian moralists
            alike view with alarm. It may be that the mischief would have been mitigated had more moderate counsels prevailed at the time of the <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Ferry">Ferry</name> law, and had the church been willing to accept (as <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Republic</name> might then have been willing to concede) right of
            entry for the clergy into the schools. But the real causes of the trouble lie deep in the philosophical and religious problems of our time, and in
            the constant and selfsacrificing devotion of the French to logical ideals on either side. Perhaps it is not too sanguine to discern in the growing
            tendency to idealism in French philosophy, and to liberal ideas in French and Catholic religious thought, the promise of a happier state of things.
            In the meantime, the religious difficulty in the schools divides the nation into two hostile camps (<foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">les
                deux Frances</hi></foreign>, as a Swiss Protestant writer puts it) in the shape of the state secular schools on the one side and the private
            religious schools on the other.</p>
          <p>In the year 1903-1904 the total number of pupils in private primary schools was 1,298,591, as against 4,935,000 in the public primary schools, but

          <p>At this point it will be convenient to describe shortly the various central and local authorities that constitute the official machine. The

            fifty-seven members, of whom the majority are elected by the higher teaching profession, while a few are nominated by the president, including a
            small number to represent private schools, and a few are elected by the primary teachers. Practically the ordinary work of the council is carried on
            by a sub-committee consisting of the nine nominees of the president and six others designated for this purpose by the minister. The council has
            administrative, judicial and disciplinary, as well as advisory, powers which enable it to exert a direct influence upon the internal organization of
            schools. There is also a pedagogic <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">comité consultatif</hi></foreign> and a legal <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi

          <p>As already indicated, for the purpose of educational administration, the departments of France are grouped in seventeen divisions called academies.
            At the head of each academy is the rector. He is appointed directly by the president and must hold the doctor's degree. He is not only the head of
            the local teaching university, but is also charged in a general way with the oversight of all three departments of education, superior, secondary
            and primary; in regard to the last, however, his functions are confined to the pedagogic side. The direct share of the rector in administration is
            mainly confined to the normal schools and the higher primary schools. The rector is assisted by an academic council composed almost exclusively of
            pedagogic elements.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Conception of secondary education.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>In proceeding to sketch the French system of higher primary and secondary schools, it may be observed that European systems of higher education
            have generally been framed upon the view that the divisions of education are longitudinal, not latitudinal, and that secondary education is a
            training complete in itself from the preparatory stage to the university, with aims and ideals of general culture which differentiate it radically
            and at the very outset from education of the elementary type. On the other hand, in the United States the view has prevailed that the divisions of
            education must be latitudinal, that the secondary school must be complementary to the elementary school, in which even the elite must receive their
            preparatory or elementary training. At any rate down to the reform of 1902, which will presently be explained, the French system could be regarded
            as a typical and even extreme example of the European theory, little consistent as this might seem to be with the broader principles of democracy.
            This view of the matter is expressed by the French terminology, by which what in England is called <q>" elementary "</q> is in France termed
              <q>"primary"</q> education.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Higher primary schools.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The thoroughness with which the principle of the autonomous character of the two divisions of education was carried out undoubtedly favoured in a
            special degree the complete organization given to higher primary instruction in the <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">écoles primaires
                supérieures</hi></foreign> under <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Third Republic</name>. The
            aim of these schools is to fill the void which must otherwise exist for those who need a higher education than the primary school can give, but for
            whose subsequent careers secondary education would be ill-adapted and injudicious. Throughout the organization of primary education the French have
            kept steadily in view the danger of creating an intellectual proletariate. <quote><foreign xml:lang="fr">" Nous poursuivons la culture générale du
                caractère et de l'esprit, mais nous cherchons en même temps à orienter l'enfant vers la vie pràtique,"</foreign></quote> says an official
            report. The aim of the higher primary school is to continue education in this spirit up to the age of sixteen so as to prepare the scholar to take
            an honourable place in the higher ranks of skilled industry rather than to deflect him towards a professional career or intellectual pursuits for
            which he is unfitted, not so much by the accidents of birth and social circumstance as by his own natural aptitudes. Within the limits necessarily
            marked out for them the higher primary schools of France have aimed at imparting what may be termed a general culture as distinct from purely
            technical or trade teaching, and this development has been greatly furthered by the separate organization given to the latter teaching in the
              <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">écoles professionnelles</hi></foreign>. At the same time, prominence is given in the higher primary
            schools to practical training of an educational character with special reference to the industries and circumstances of the locality, and in the
            rural districts a special agricultural bias is imparted to the curriculum. It is interesting to note that the institution of the higher primary
            schools was due in large part to the spontaneous initiative of the municipalities, and that in the later phases of state organization special care
            has been taken to avoid anything in the nature of a rigid uniformity in these schools.</p>

          <p>A wider extension has been given to higher primary instruction by the establishment of <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">cours
                complémentaires</hi></foreign> in certain schools, at centres at which it would be impossible to organize separate higher primary schools. A
            similar solution of the continuation school problem has recently commended itself to the consultative committee of <name type="institution">the
              Board of Education</name> for England.</p>
          <p>Admission to the higher primary schools in France is only accorded to those who have obtained the elementary school leaving certificate, <foreign
              xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">certificat d'etudes primaires</hi></foreign>. A feature of importance for continuation work in rural districts is
            the provision made for boarding scholars in attendance at these schools. The boarding arrangements are generally, as in the case of the secondary
            schools, left to the head teacher, but in some instances municipal hostels have been provided. No fees may be charged for higher primary
            instruction, and scholarships (<foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">bourses</hi></foreign>) are provided to a certain extent in the form either
            of boarding scholarships or maintenance allowances to compensate the parent for the loss of the child's labour. The number of scholars in the public
            higher primary schools for the year 1903- 1904 was 34,084, and in <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">cours complémentaires</hi></foreign>
            21,777, making a total of 55,861. In addition there were 8891 scholars in receipt of higher primary instruction in private schools.</p>

          <p><name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">The Republic</name> has not reorganized secondary education by a

            schools which marks a notable <pb n="964"/> departure from the traditional view of secondary education as a self-contained whole. Article I of the
            decree of May 31, 1902, declares that secondary education is co-ordinated with primary education in such a way as to constitute a continuation of a
            course of primary studies of a normal education, duration of four years. The decree goes on to provide for a full course of secondary studies of
            seven years' duration, divided into two cycles of four and three years respectively. In the first cycle the scholar has two options. In section 1
            Latin is obligatory and Greek optional from the beginning of the third year <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">(classe IV.)</hi></foreign>. In
            section 2 there is no Latin. At the end of the first cycle the state grants a <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">certificat d'études
                secondaires du premier degré</hi></foreign>. In the second cycle one of four courses may be taken; section 1 with Latin and Greek continues the

                >Realgymnasium</hi></foreign> ; section 3 with Latin and science, and section 4 with modern languages and science, to the <foreign xml:lang="de"

            school-leaving examination, conducted by the university, is adapted to all the courses on the principle that courses of study of equal length,
            whether classical or modern, literary or scientific, are entitled to equal advantages. This system of alternative courses with leaving examinations
            of equal value is mainly German in origin, and may be said to represent the results of the best European thought upon the problem of the

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Private secondary schools.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>In addition to the state schools there have until lately been in France a large number of private secondary schools, the most important of which
            have been associated with the Catholic religious orders. The enforcement of the laws against these communities has resulted in the closure of a
            number of these schools, and in the reorganization of others under a lay teaching staff. It is conceivable that the action of <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Third_Republic">the Republic</name> may largely forward the movement, otherwise
            perceptible in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Catholic Church</name>, to transfer
            education, even when combined with specific religious teaching, from ecclesiastical to lay hands. Evidence of this tendency is to be found in the
            boarding-schools (some four in number) founded upon the plan of <bibl><author><name type="person">M. Demolins</name></author> (author of <title><hi

          <p>Apart from the position of the religious orders, the future of private education in France is far from secure at the present time. The liberty of
            teaching secured by the <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">Loi Falloux</hi></foreign> is regarded as a pseudo-liberty by the advanced
            republican educationists, and the principle that education is a function of the state and not a matter of supply and demand is deeply rooted in the
            public mind. Proposals have been mooted for making the <foreign xml:lang="fr">baccalauréat</foreign> strictly a school-leaving examination attached
            to the state schools. The adoption of any such measure would practically destroy liberty of teaching by reason of the power which the <foreign

            general legislative assertion of principle is attended in Germany as in England. The consequence is that the Prussian system in particular is the
            result of a long and complicated series of special laws, decrees and administrative regulations. In such circumstances it is inevitable that,
            especially in secondary education, some considerable local variations and anomalies should remain, but the centralized authority of the state has
            confined these to questions of patronage and external administration, and even within this sphere has successfully asserted its own ultimate
            supremacy as the guardian of the educational interests of its citizens. A detailed historical study would bring out clearly the intimate connexion

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saxony">Saxony</name>, which by a school ordinance of 1528 provided for the establishment in every town and
            village of Latin schools, for in Germany as in England the influence of the Protestant reformers was solidly on the side of classical education as
            the key to the study of the Scriptures and theological learning. All the more remarkable, therefore, was the initiative of the electorate of <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Württemberg">Württemberg</name>, whose school ordinance of 1559 represents the first systematic
            attempt to make provision for both elementary and higher education, directing that elementary schools should be set up throughout the country, and
              <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Particularschulen</hi></foreign> or Latin schools in every considerable centre of population. The
            educational efforts both of the early Reformers and of the remarkable Jesuit educationists, who contributed so largely to the partial reconquest of
            south Germany for the Catholic Church, were brought to naught amid the troublous times of the Thirty Years' War, and the desolation and national
            decadence which that calamity brought in its train. To this result the aridity of the Protestant scholastics who succeeded <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philipp_Melanchthon"
              >Melanchthon</name>, and the frivolity, incompetence and petty despotism of the small German courts, contributed in no slight measure. The
            permanent and positive value of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name>'s pronouncement of 1524 consists
            not so much in the direct effects which it produced as in the hallowed association which it established for Protestant Germany between the national
            religion and the educational duties of the individual and the state, and doubtless this association largely contributed to the creation of <pb

          <p>State interference in education is almost coincident with the rise of the Prussian state. Already in 1717 <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_William_I_of_Prussia">Frederick William I.</name> ordered all children to attend school where schools
            existed, and fixed the fee at 5 pf. (1/2 d.) a week. This was followed in 1736 by edicts for the establishment of schools in certain provinces and
            by a royal grant of 50,000 thalers for that purpose in the following year. In 1763 the <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">General
                Landschulreglement</hi></foreign> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_II_of_Prussia">Frederick the Great</name>
            laid down the broad lines upon which the Prussian state has since proceeded, asserting the principle of compulsory school attendance, fixing the
            fees, with provision for the assistance of very poor children, prescribing the course of instruction, and giving directions for the examination and
            supervision of teachers. Much progress was made, more especially in the organization of higher education, under <name type="person">Baron von
              Zedlitz</name>, who was appointed minister for Lutheran church and school affairs by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_II_of_Prussia">Frederick the Great</name> in 1771, and retired under <name type="person"

            element in the state organization of secondary education in Germany. As in England, the fear of the French Revolution produced a corresponding

            boldly proclaims that schools and educational institutions may be founded only with the knowledge and consent of the state, and must always be under

            observed that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name>'s policy in secondary education represents
            a compromise between the narrow philological pedantry of the old Latin schools and the large demands of the new humanism of the period; and the
            recent reform of the Prussian secondary schools may be said to represent a return to the spirit of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> in this respect. The measure introduced by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt">Humboldt</name> in 1810 for the state examination and certification of teachers checked the
            then common practice of permitting unqualified theological students to teach in the schools, and at once raised the teaching profession to a high
            level of dignity and efficiency which of itself sufficed to place <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in the
            forefront of educational progress. It was due also to the initiative of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt"
              >Humboldt</name> that the methods of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi">Pestalozzi</name> were
            introduced into the teachers' seminaries, through them to vitalize the elementary schools. To the period of the national struggle belong the revival

          <p>Though the period which succeeded the peace of 1815 was one of political reaction, the cabinet order of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_William_III_of_Prussia">Frederick William III.</name> in 1825 strengthened the law of compulsory

              >Provinzial-Schul-Kollegium</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="de">Regierung</foreign>. In 1834 an important development was given to secondary
            education by making it necessary for candidates for the learned professions as well as for the civil service, and for university studies, to have
            passed the leaving examination of the gymnasia. Thus through the leaving examination the state holds the key to the liberal careers, and has thereby
            been able to impose its own standard upon all secondary schools. Apart from the privileges relative to professional studies, the system of leaving
            examinations has exerted a wide influence upon popular education in connexion with the institution of compulsory military service, in virtue of a
            regulation which entitles those who pass the leaving examination of any of the recognized kinds of secondary schools to the much-coveted privilege
            of service for one year as a <q>" volunteer "</q> instead of two years as an ordinary conscript.</p>
          <p>The revolutionary and national movement of 1848 was followed by a period of further educational activity. <title>The Act of Constitution</title> of
            1850 declared teachers civil servants and elementary education free. In practice, the abolition of school fees did not become general until 1888.
            Since then the view has more and more prevailed that elementary education must be free <note>See especially <bibl><title><hi rend="italic">Das

            but the severity of this law as a measure against Roman Catholic clerical education was considerably modified as a result of the subsequent
            reconciliation with the papacy under <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pope_Leo_III">Leo XIII.</name>, and the Prussian system
            remains to-day both for Catholics and Protestants essentially denominational. All schools, whether elementary or secondary, are Evangelical,
            Catholic, Jewish or mixed. In the elementary sphere, in particular, recourse is only had to the mixed school (<foreign xml:lang="de"><hi
                rend="italic">Simultanschule</hi></foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">paritätische Schule</hi></foreign>), where the creeds
            are so intermingled that a confessional school is impracticable. In all cases the teachers are appointed with reference to religious faith;
            religious instruction is given compulsorily in school hours and is inspected by the clergy. The general purport of <title>the Prussian school law of
              1906</title> is to strengthen the system of separate confessional schools, which it extends to certain provinces where it had not previously been
            in operation.</p>
          <p>In financial respects the last-mentioned law effected some readjustment of burdens by charging a proportion of the expenditure upon landed
            property. Other recent changes relate to the reform of secondary education referred to below. The system of educational administration as it stood
            in 1909 may shortly be described as follows.</p>

          <p>In the Protestant districts the inspectors <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">(Kreisschulinspektoren)</hi></foreign> are usually Evangelical
            clergymen holding the position of superintendent in the Lutheran Church. In the Catholic and certain other exceptional districts inspectors with
            pedagogical qualifications and the status of full government inspectors are appointed. Every candidate for Lutheran ordination is required to spend
            six months at a training college, but pedagogical opinion is hostile to the system, which must be regarded as a survival of the traditional union of
            church and state in educational affairs, retained at the present day from motives of economy and a desire to conciliate the church.</p>
          <p>For every school there is an <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Ortsschulinspektor</hi></foreign>, usually the clergyman of the parish, who
            discharges the duties of local manager and correspondent. This local inspector is also chairman of the <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic"

          <p>Thus the administrative system of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in education as in other matters may
            be described in general as a decentralized bureaucracy. This bureaucracy is somewhat checked by the rights of patronage attaching to the local
            boards in certain cases, but the exercise of such rights is in all cases subject to government approval. As regards higher-grade elementary and
            secondary schools, the local boards in the towns <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">(Schuldeputationen)</hi></foreign> are able to exert a
            considerable influence in the way of selection of the type of school, and even of suggestion for the modification of recognized types, as is shown

          <p><hi rend="italic">Elementary Schools.</hi> — The single-class school <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">(Einklassige Schule)</hi></foreign>
            and the half-day school <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">(Halbtagsschule)</hi></foreign> are features of the Prussian elementary system
            which require notice. The <foreign xml:lang="de">Einklassige Schule</foreign> is a school taught by a single teacher, who may teach a maximum number
            of eighty children. The <foreign xml:lang="de">Halbtagsschule</foreign> is a single-class school of which half the children are taught in the
            morning and half in the afternoon. During the summer months, owing to the exigencies of agricultural labour, many single-class schools are taught as
            half-day schools. The system of course is regarded as a makeshift, but in this, as in the matter of buildings for rural elementary schools, the
            Prussian administration attaches great weight to the consideration of financial economy. As regards staff, a large measure of economy is rendered
            possible by the high average standard of merit reached by German elementary teachers, whose powers of oral exposition have struck English observers
            as specially remarkable, and again by the national readiness to be content with a moderate salary in return for official status. A survival of the
            old close connexion between church and school is to be found in the <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Kirchendienste</hi></foreign>, the
            duties of training the choir, playing the organ, etc., which are attached in many cases to the post of schoolmaster, and afford an additional source
            of emolument, rendered feasible by the practical absence of religious dissent.</p>
          <p>For the preliminary training of elementary teachers there are special schools called <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic"
                >Präparanden-Anstalten</hi></foreign>, of which most are state institutions, some are municipal, and a few are private. The training colleges
            themselves are provided by the state and have a three years' course.</p>

          <p><hi rend="italic">Continuation Schools</hi><foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">(Fortbildungsschulen)</hi></foreign>.—Germans have been
            foremost to realize the truth which is gradually being brought home to English educationists, that adequate value for the heavy expenditure of
            public funds upon education can only be obtained by providing for the continued education for two or three years of the children of the working
            classes who leave school at fourteen years of age. One of the educational results of the war of 1870, with its great lesson of the importance of
            national education, was the <title>Saxon law</title> of 1873 making attendance at continuation schools compulsory for three years (i.e. up to
            seventeen) in that kingdom. The Saxon law appears to have been justified by the experience of nearly a generation. It must suffice here to note the
            following features of its working. (1) The schools are taught by the primary teachers, supplemented in the towns by some technical instructors. (2)
            The school session may be either for the whole year or for only half the year, and may also be held on Sunday, like the old English secular Sunday
            schools. (3) The schools are brought into close relation with trades, not only for purposes of curriculum, but also with a view to considering the
            exigencies and meeting the convenience of employers with respect to hours of attendance. (4) The discipline of the continuation school is extended
            to supervision out of school hours. <quote>" Visits to dancing-halls and all such exhibitions as are dangerous to uprightness and purity are
              forbidden to scholars of continuation schools."</quote> Further, useful institutions such as savings banks, and also associations for social
            intercourse and the promotion of <foreign xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi></foreign>, are organized in connexion with
            continuation schools. There is no doubt that in this matter of continuation schools, as in so many other fields of social organization, the adoption
            of compulsion has been facilitated by the habituation of the working classes to compulsory military service, which has made the German workman more

          <p><hi rend="italic">First-grade Schools.</hi>—One of the most striking features of German secondary education is the careful differentiation of
            schools according to the type of curriculum adopted. Thus, every German school is a homogeneous unit with a definite educational aim and
            organization, conforming to a common standard approved by public authority for the particular type to which it belongs. Hence the importance
            attached by the Germans to nomenclature; so that in selecting a <foreign xml:lang="de">Gymnasium</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="de"
              >Realgymnasium</foreign> or an <foreign xml:lang="de">Oberrealschule</foreign>, the parent knows exactly the type of education he is going to
            secure for his son. In England, on the other hand, as has often been observed, a great school tends to multiply within itself different types of
            curricula in a haphazard way according to the demand of parents, whose original choice of school is based rather on social than on educational
            grounds. Modern sides, army classes and engineering classes grow up as excrescences upon an originally classical type, with the waste of power that
            results from loss of consistency and concentration of purpose. The difference between the English and German systems is due ultimately to the
            adoption in Germany of the day-school system and the absence, very remarkable in an otherwise aristocratically governed country, of the caste spirit
            in education above the elementary level, thanks to which the nobly born are not ashamed to sit on the school bench side by side with the children of
            the trading classes. On the other hand, the English boarding-school system, despite all the want of social solidarity, and all the class jealousy
            and exclusiveness with which it is inevitably associated, has admittedly favoured those ideals of the cultivation of character as distinct from
            book-learning which give a special value to what is in England called a public school education.</p>

          <p>The present differentiation of first-grade schools in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> is the result of
            a natural educational development corresponding with the economic changes which have transformed <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> and the empire from an agricultural to an industrial state. It was in 1855 that

              >Realschule I. Ordnung</foreign>, and in 1871 pupils possessing their leaving certificates were admitted to mathematical studies in the
            universities. The Latinless <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule II. Ordnung</foreign> is the direct product of the great industrial development of the
            modern empire. In 1882 the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule I. Ordnung</foreign> received the title of <foreign xml:lang="de"
              >Realgymnasium</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realschule II. Ordnung</foreign> that of <foreign xml:lang="de">Oberrealschule</foreign>,

              Gorobiy</note>. These two types differ from each other in detail, but the feature which distinguishes both from the older types is the
            postponement of Latin to Untertertia. The design is to secure for all types of secondary education a common non-classical base coextensive with the
            first three years of school life, followed by a bifurcation or threefold choice between the classical, semiclassical and non-classical types. The
            principle of the <q>" reform-school "</q> has been adopted in a considerable number of German (chiefly Prussian) schools, but it would be premature
            to see in it at present more than a new variety of <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> or semiclassical school ; it can hardly be said as
            yet to have affected the course of classical studies in the full sense. The widespread sentiment of discontent with the old philological type of
            classical school was vigorously expressed in a private letter written by the emperor <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor">William II.</name> as crown prince of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> in 1885, but not published until some years later. In December 1890 the Prussian ministry
            convoked a conference at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> of secondary school experts, and the emperor
            presided in person at the opening session. His Majesty delivered a speech criticizing the Gymnasia as wanting a national basis. <quote>" It is our
              duty to educate young men to become young Germans and not young Greeks or Romans"</quote> was the keynote of the imperial discourse. The outcome
            of the conference was a shortening of the hours allowed to Latin in the Gymnasia, a reduction of the hours of study in view of over-pressure, and an
            expression of official opinion adverse to the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>. These changes, introduced in 1892, did not go far
            enough to satisfy the reformers, whilst the reduction of the hours allowed for Latin caused misgivings among the upholders of the traditional
            Gymnasium. Moreover, the <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign> showed greater vitality among the large towns than its official critics
            anticipated. The ensuing decade witnessed a certain reaction in favour of the classical humanities as a barrier against the materialistic influences
            of the new industrialism. At the same time the protagonists of the classics came to recognize that side by side with the old humanities there must
            be accorded to modern and scientific subjects that place in the high-grade schools which the practical exigencies of industrial life demanded. Thus,
            the opinion grew that the best line of defence for the classical schools lay in the concession of equal privileges to the non-classical types ; in
            this way only could the classical schools be kept safe from demands upon their time that could not be conceded without endangering their proper
            work. It was upon this basis that an agreement was reached between the contending parties at a second school conference that met in <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> in June 1900. As the result of this conference there was issued a royal decree
            laying down certain general principles, of which the following are the most important. <list>
              <item>(1) There must be equality of privileges as between classical, semiclassical and non-classical first-grade schools. The decree recognizes,
                however, that this principle must be applied with a certain elasticity and with due regard to the necessity for training in particular branches
                of knowledge as a preliminary to certain lines of university study and certain professional pursuits. Consequently the Prussian system of
                privileges has become extremely complicated, and it is truer to speak, as the decree goes on to do, of an extension of the privileges of the
                nonclassical schools, rather than of absolute equality.</item>
              <item>(2) <quote>" In thus acknowledging the equality of the three types of higher institutions, it will be possible more thoroughly to strengthen
                  the special characteristics of each type. In this connexion," the royal decree proceeds, " I shall offer no objection to an increase in the
                  number of hours devoted to Latin in the Gymnasium and <foreign xml:lang="de">Realgymnasium</foreign>."</quote> Thus, both as to the place of
                Latin in the curriculum of classical schools and as to the status of semi-classical schools, the decree of 1900 involves a reversal of the
                policy of 1890.</item>
              <item>(3) The decree expresses approval of the reformed curricula of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Altona,_Hamburg"

          <p>Notwithstanding the growing official encouragement of education upon semi-classical or non-classical lines, the upper and professional classes of
            Germany continue to show a marked preference for the fully classical Gymnasium; hence, in Germany as in England, the tendency for a widening gulf to
            disclose itself between the education of the directing classes in politics and administration and the bulk of the industrial population, which
            suggests that the problem of combining in just proportions the liberal and practical elements in a thoroughly national system of education has not
            yet reached the solution that the needs of the age require.</p>

          <p>Switzerland affords perhaps the best type of a democratic system of local authorities. The central authority is the canton, not the federation. The

              <item>(1) states that primary instruction must be under <pb n="968"/> the control of the canton (an important point in view of the strength of

              <item>(3) forbids the employment of child labour before completion of the fourteenth year, with a provision that in the fifteenth and sixteenth
                years factory work, together with the time given to school and religious instruction, must not exceed eleven hours a day.</item>
              <item>(4) All recruits for the federal army (in which service is compulsory on a militia basis) are examined in their twentieth year, and the
                results are published.</item>

          <p>The cantonal organization of education presents the variety which the extraordinary diversity of race, language, religion and physical conditions
            of the component states of the federation would lead one to expect. The large <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canton_of_Berne"
              >canton of Bern</name> may be instanced as the type of a strong central authority. The commune or parish is the unit for elementary education. The
            communal council nominates a school board of at least five members, whose function is to spend the money voted for school purposes by the general
            communal council. Several communes in combination form a district authority for the support of what are in reality higher primary schools, though
            called in Switzerland <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Sekundarschulen</hi></foreign>, maintained by the district. The maintenance both of
            the primary and higher primary schools is aided by grants from the central authority. The true secondary schools, called middle or higher schools,
            are maintained and controlled by the central or cantonal authority. The existence of separate local authorities for each grade of education is
            characteristic of Switzerland generally, this system being the opposite to that adopted in England in 1902.</p>
          <p>The central grants in Switzerland always take the form of payments to the local authorities of a proportion of the teachers' salaries ; they are
            never, as in England, assessed upon the number of children in attendance, nor are they dependent, as was formerly the case in England, upon the
            results of examination, nor again are grants made in respect of particular subjects as is the case with the grants for special, i.e. practical,
            instruction in England.</p>
          <p>Religious instruction in the Swiss communal schools generally follows the faith of the majority; in a few cantons separate schools being provided
            for minorities if sufficiently numerous. In the town of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucerne">Lucerne</name>, Catholic
            instruction is given in school hours, and Protestant instruction is provided out of school and out of hours for the Protestant minority.</p>
          <p>In 19 out of the 25 cantons attendance at continuation schools is compulsory (at least in some districts) for boys up to 17, and in 3 cantons it is
            compulsory also wholly or in part for girls.</p>

          <p>The interesting feature in Belgian education is the treatment of the religious question in successive laws.</p>
          <list>
            <item>I. The law of 1842 obliged the communes to provide primary instruction, which was to be free in the case of poor children. The state made
              grants in aid, subject to inspection. Subject to a conscience clause, religious instruction was obligatory, and was placed under ecclesiastical
              inspection.</item>
            <item>2. The law of 1879 removed religious instruction from the curriculum, and provided for facilities to the clergy to give such instruction
              outside school hours. This law furnishes a striking instance of the futility of a parliamentary majority legislating in a sense opposed to the
              convictions of a considerable section of the community. The law evoked a storm of opposition in the country, still profoundly Catholic and
              attached to ecclesiastical traditions, and within eighteen months the Catholics founded private elementary schools with 455,000 scholars. In 1883
              the Catholic private schools numbered 622,000 scholars, whilst the attendance at the communal schools had sunk to 324,000. Their doctrinaire
              treatment of the education question resulted in the political annihilation of the Belgian Liberals, and was responsible for the strongest and most
              persistent Roman Catholic reaction that has been witnessed in western Europe since the beginning of the 19th century.</item>
            <item>3. The law of 1884 was the work of the moderate Catholic party. It did not make religious instruction obligatory, but it gave liberty to the
              communes to provide for the giving of religious and moral instruction at the beginning or end of school hours, subject to a conscience clause.
              Power was given to the communes to <q>" adopt "</q> private confessional schools and maintain them. Provision was further made entitling any
              twenty parents of children of school age to demand a school of the normal communal type, as against a proposal to adopt a confessional school.
              Power was also given to a like number of parents to compel the adoption of a confessional school in the case of the commune refusing to provide
              religious instruction of the type demanded by them, or putting obstacles in the way of its being given by the clergy or their
              representatives.</item>
            <item>4. The law of 1895 is the work of the more authoritarian Catholics, and makes religious instruction obligatory, placing it directly under the
              control of the clergy. It also increased the subsidies to private schools. This law was passed in face of opposition from the moderate section,
              who saw in it an exaltation of state authority which might be turned by opponents to the disadvantage of the religious interest.- It is by no
              means clear that Belgium has yet attained a final solution of the religious difficulty ; the life of the present law is probably to be measured by
              that of the Catholic political majority.</item>

          <p>The outstanding feature of public education in Holland is the strength of the private primary schools. Under the law of 1857 secular teaching alone
            was provided in the primary schools at the public cost. The law of 1878 allowed communes to make grants to private schools on condition of their
            becoming neutral in the matter of religion. The law of 1889 allowed private denominational schools to receive government grants while retaining
            their denominational character, but forbade further grants to such schools by the communes.</p>

            obtaining in Wales have received partial recognition at the hands both of the legislature and the executive. In Scotland the conditions have been
            less complex than in England. The practical unanimity of the people in religious faith, which has remained undisturbed by the institutional
            divisions of recent times, the wider diffusion of a sense of the value of education, the greater simplicity of life which has rendered all classes
            largely content to avail themselves of the preparatory education afforded by the common school and favoured the development in the secondary sphere
            of day rather than boarding schools, are among the causes which have contributed to the early building up of a national system which in some

            school and to keep them there until they had perfect Latin. The Reformation, asserting itself by common consent under one ecclesiastical form, and
            free from the divisions of religious organization which tended to neutralize it as an educational force in England, put fresh life into the
            educational aspirations of the people. As early as 1560 <name type="institution">the Church Assembly</name>, largely under the influence of <name

                "</quote> town was to have <quote>" a college for logic, rhetoric and the tongues."</quote></ref> Practical effect was later given to this
            scheme by an act of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament">the Scottish parliament</name> in 1696, under
            which parish schools were set up in connexion with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_Scotland">the Established
              Church of Scotland</name>. This system was extended by an act of 1803, which made better provision for teachers' salaries and also confirmed the
            position of the parish school as an adjunct of the parish church. The system of inspection and state aid introduced in England in 1839 was made
            applicable to Scotland, thus grafting upon Scotland the English system of voluntary state-aided schools. At the same period another new factor was
            imported into Scottish education by the ecclesiastical disruption of 1843. As a result of these changes in 1861 a new act was passed which relaxed,
            though it did not sever, the ties which bound the parish school to the church.</p>

          <p>The Education (Scotland) Act of 1872 set up elective school boards for parishes and boroughs, and vested in them the existing parish and burgh
            schools. Long prior to the act it had been the practice of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_Scotland">the Church
              of Scotland</name> to allow exemption in the schools from religious instruction ; consequently in imposing a compulsory conscience clause the act
            did little more than confirm existing usage. The school boards were left full liberty as to the religious instruction to be given in their schools,
            and in practice school boards universally adopt <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Shorter_Catechism">Westminster Shorter
              Catechism</title>, which is acceptable to all denominations of Presbyterians. The act made the school boards responsible for the supply of school
            accommodation, and introduced compulsory attendance, for which opinion in England was not at that time ripe. By the act of 1901, the age of
            compulsory attendance was raised to fourteen, with provision for exemption after twelve.</p>

          <p>The experience of <name type="institution">the Scottish Education Department</name>, like that of the English, has led to the gradual abandonment
            of individual examination as the basis for the payment of grants. The institution of the merit certificate is one of the features in which the
            Scottish system differs from the English. Prior to the code of 1903 the merit certificate, awarded on examination after the age of twelve, was
            properly described as the leaving certificate of the elementary school. Under the more recent codes merit certificates are awarded under a system
            designed to encourage the transference of promising pupils at an early age to supplementary courses or higher-grade departments. Under this system
            the fitness of the pupil to enter upon a course of higher studies is determined not solely by the results of a single examination, but by the whole
            character of his work during the preceding school course.</p>

              "</quote></ref> or secondary schools. The act of 1908 deals in some detail with secondary education, modifying and strengthening the framework in
            various ways, but without introducing organic changes, <q>" Secondary "</q> schools are distinguished from <q>"intermediate,"</q> the former being
            defined as providing at least a five years' course ; the latter as providing at least a three years' course in languages, mathematics, science and
            such other subjects as may from time to time be deemed suitable for the instruction of pupils who have reached a certain standard of attainment in
            elementary subjects under the code. Intermediate and secondary schools may be provided and maintained either by school boards or otherwise, and
            provision is contained in the act for the transfer of endowed schools to the school board. Thus secondary (as well as elementary and continuative)
            education is organized upon the basis of the parish or burgh ; it receives, however, grants in aid through the agency of county (or large urban)
            authorities (called district committees) constituted under schemes of <name type="institution">the Scottish Education Department</name>. For the

            allocated to the district committees according to a scheme laid before parliament and approved by the king in council. Out of the <q>" district

            district of the school board as the committee may determine, not being more than a rate of twopence in the pound. Important powers are also
            conferred upon the district committee for organizing and aiding within their district the provision by the school boards of medical examination and
            supervision of school children, the supply of bursaries for purposes of all forms of higher education, and the provision of instruction in special
            subjects, such as agriculture, etc.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Special difficulties of Irish education.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The full development of a system of public education in Ireland has been hampered and retarded by the general difficulties inherent in the problem
            of Irish government. In consequence of the fundamentally different social, religious and political conditions in the two countries, the English and
            Irish systems have developed down to the present time upon divergent lines. In England, popular education was founded in the first instance upon
            individual initiative combining in organized voluntary effort, and, though the voluntary agencies have been first supplemented and latterly to a
            large extent supplanted by public action, the tendency has been in the direction of municipalization rather than in that of central state control.
            In Ireland, on the other hand, education has suffered in the past from the general absence of individual initiative and local interest almost as
            seriously as from the mistakes of the English government. These causes, more directly perhaps than the prevailing poverty of the country, made it
            necessary to throw the burden of supporting the schools to an increasing extent upon the state, while the want of local self-government precluded
            any devolution of powers and duties upon municipal authorities.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Historical retrospect.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>State intervention is actually of earlier date in Ireland than in England. From the reign of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth</name> onwards, English Protestant schools were founded by the government in a
            sporadic and intermittent fashion in pursuance of its Anglicizing policy. To mention briefly one or two historical features, the great religious
            educational enterprise of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Ignatius_Rice">Edmond Rice</name> in founding the well-known
              <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers">Irish Catholic order of the Christian
              Brothers</name> in 1802 forms an exception to the general lack of initiative among the people themselves. About the same period <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kildare_Place_National_School">the Kildare Place Society</name> (founded in 1811 while the
            first commission of inquiry into Irish education was sitting) attempted to grapple with the peculiar difficulties of the religious situation upon
            lines somewhat similar to those just laid down by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> and his
            followers in England. This organization comprised both Roman Catholic and Protestant schools upon a common religious basis of <title>Bible</title>
            reading without note or comment, and received government grants which rose to £30,000 a year before they were discontinued in 1833. The religious
            compromise which the system embodied broke down in consequence of Catholic dissatisfaction, and that it was at first fairly successful may seem
            extraordinary in view of the later attitude of the Catholic Church towards the question of common schools and combined religious instruction.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The national system.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>In 1833, as the result of a second commission of inquiry (1824) and a select committee of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name> (1828), <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Smith-Stanley,_14th_Earl_of_Derby">Mr Stanley</name> inaugurated the national system of elementary schools
            under a board of commissioners nominated from the different religious denominations. The government appears from the outset to have aimed at
            combined secular and separate religious instruction for Roman Catholics and Protestants. At the same time, an attempt was inconsistently made to
            provide an ethical basis for the secular instruction by means of <title>Bible</title> extracts. The story of the preparation of these extracts by an
            ingenious compound of the Protestant Authorized and <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douay-Rheims_Bible">Douai</title> versions of Scripture
            is in its way one of the curiosities of religious history. The extracts were designed to meet the recognized Catholic objection to the
            indiscriminate reading of <title>the Bible</title> without note or comment. In practice they were chiefly used in the Protestant schools (in which
            their use is now practically extinct), and the growing Catholic objection to the policy of <name type="institution">the National Board</name> in
            this respect found authoritative, though somewhat cautiously worded, expression in a decree of the Roman Congregation <ref><title>De Propaganda
                Fide</title> of January 11, 1846, declaring that non-sectarian religious instruction was dangerous to youth. <quote><foreign xml:lang="la">"

            process of time by the conversion of the national system in practice, though not in theory, into a system strongly denominational and therefore
            widely different from the design of its founders, combined Biblical instruction being discarded, and separate schools for the most part taking the
            place of common schools for the two creeds. In the latter respect the like tendency has been noted in the case of Germany.</p>
          <p>The following are the chief specific points upon which the Irish system of elementary education differs from the English.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Irish elementary education.</hi></hi></head>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Finance.</hi>—The state still makes building grants to the extent of two-thirds of the cost. Such grants are only made to what
            are called vested schools, that is to say, schools of which the premises are vested in trustees or in the commissioners themselves. The state
            further pays in the case of all national schools the entire cost of maintenance except only the upkeep of the building, and the provision of books
            after the exhaustion of a first free grant.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Appointment and Payment of Teachers.</hi>—For the purpose of promotion the state through its inspectors undertakes the duty of
            classifying the individual teachers in four grades, passage from one grade to another being secured by examination. Appointments of teachers to
            schools are made by the school managers subject to the approval of the commissioners. Rights of dismissal are reserved to the local managers and
            also to the commissioners independently. Lastly, the teachers' salaries are now paid directly by the state. The old system of payment by results was
            abandoned in 1900, and the teacher is paid <list>
              <item>(a) a fixed salary according to grade,</item>
              <item>(b) a continued good service salary which may be increased triennially,</item>
              <item>(c) a capitation payment</item>
            </list>.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Convent Schools.</hi>—In addition to the national schools supported as above, there are a considerable number of convent or
            monastery schools which receive capitation grants after the English plan, but not direct salaries. There were 308 such schools in 1908, with an
            average attendance of 70,003. There were also 83 other convent or monastery schools paid by personal salaries, with an average attendance of
            11,075.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">School Attendance and Free Education.</hi>— <title>The Irish Education Act 1892</title> provided for compulsory attendance in
            towns and for the adoption of compulsion in other districts. In virtue of the financial sections of this act, which provided an increased grant for
            salaries, most national schools have become free.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">General Elementary-School Statistics.</hi>—In 1908 the average number of scholars on the rolls of all the schools was 708,992,
            and the average daily attendance was 494,662, or 69-8 % as compared with the number on the rolls. As regards religious denomination, 74-42 % of the
            scholars on the rolls were Roman Catholics; 28-6 % were in schools attended by both Roman Catholic and Protestant children and 71-4 % in schools
            attended solely by Roman Catholics or solely by Protestants. The total expenditure on the schools and teaching staffs was £1,591,214, of which
            £1,451,139, equivalent to £2, 19s. 3d. per scholar, was contributed from state grants, and £140,074, equivalent to 5s. 9d. per scholar, from local
            (i.e. voluntary) sources, the rate per scholar from all sources being £3, 5s.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Training of Teachers.</hi>—Salaried monitors are employed in the Irish schools, but, unlike the English pupil teachers, are not
            explicitly recognized as forming part of the school staff. There are now seven training colleges, viz. one undenominational college maintained by
            the commissioners, five Roman Catholic colleges, and one college in connexion with <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_Ireland">the Protestant Episcopal Church of Ireland</name>. Of the scholars in the undenominational
            college, 73 out of 312 were Roman Catholics. The total number of students in training was 1189, viz. 514 men and 675 women. The percentage of
            trained teachers to the total number of teachers was 64-7. A special training college for the instruction of teachers in Irish has been
            recognized.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Secondary education.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>One of the chief desiderata in Irish education is a single central authority for all branches of education, elementary, secondary (or <q>"
              intermediate "</q>) and technical. There are two <pb n="971"/> central authorities dealing with secondary education, viz. <name type="institution"
              >the Intermediate Education Board</name> and <name type="institution">the Department for Agriculture and Technical Instruction</name>. The
            Intermediate Board administers sums available under <title>the Intermediate Education Act of 1878</title> from the Irish Church Surplus, and also
            the sum allocated under <title>the Local Taxation Act 1890</title>. The vice of the system in the opinion of educational experts lies in the
            statutory obligation to award grants on the result of an individual examination of the scholars. As a result of the vice-regal commission of 1898,
            power was taken to introduce a system of school inspection, though not to dispense with the individual examination as the basis for the award of the
            grants; this measure of reform was ultimately carried out in 1909. The sum distributed in result grants is about £50,000 per annum.</p>
          <p>Prior to <title>the Agriculture and Technical Instruction (Ireland) Act 1899</title>, science and art grants were administered by <name
              type="institution">the Science and Art Department</name> in England ; by this act they were transferred to the new <name type="institution">Irish
              Department for Agriculture and Technical Instruction</name>. This department makes block grants to secondary schools in respect of science and art
            teaching, and manual instruction or domestic economy. Measures have been taken for the co-ordination of the duties of <name type="institution">the
              Technical Department</name> and <name type="institution">the Intermediate Board</name>, and the impetus given to the teaching of experimental
            science by grants for the erection of laboratories represents a reform of undoubted value for higher education in Ireland, especially when
            considered in connexion with the enlistment of the local interest of the technical education committees in the intermediate schools. Nevertheless,
            in the absence of a reform of the results system of intermediate grants, the special subsidizing of science teaching has tended to put an undue
            premium upon this subject to the detriment of the rest of the curriculum.</p>
          <p>Ireland possesses no such system of scholarships for assisting the passage of scholars from the elementary to the secondary school as England
            enjoys as a result of the municipalization of the educational system. Nevertheless, Irish children as a fact pass much more freely from the
            elementary to the secondary school than is the case in England where social prejudices are stronger. The schools of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_Christian_Brothers">the Christian Brothers</name> are usually organized in two departments,
            primary and intermediate, and thus supply for the Roman Catholic population the demand for the cheap type of secondary day school represented by the
            municipal schools in England. It must be added that the Irish intermediate schools are purely denominational. The widespread demand for secondary
            education among the people, to which the report of Messrs <name type="person">Dale</name> and <name type="person">Stephens</name> bears witness, is
            a gratifying feature of Irish life, while the recent establishment (1908) of the long-deferred national university, and the perceptible quickening
            of intellectual interests throughout the country in connexion with the Celtic revival, point to better conditions for higher education and to the
            development of a wider, deeper and truer, because more national, culture.</p>

                beforehand by statesmen or philosophers; it has come into existence through a long course of experiments, compromises, traditions, successes,
                failures and religious controversies. What has been done in this department of public policy is the resultant of many diverse forces and of slow
                evolution and growth rather than of pure purpose and well-defined national aims. It has been effected in different degrees by philanthropy, by
                private enterprise, by religious zeal, by ancient universities and endowed foundations, by municipal and local effort, and only to a small
                extent by legislation. The genius—or rather characteristic habit—of the English people is averse from the philosophical system, and is disposed
                to regard education, not as a science, but as a body of expedients to be discovered empirically and amended from time to time as occasion may
                require."</quote></ref> Clearly, then, the English system of public education, as it results from successive acts of the administration and the
            legislature, is one which can only adequately be appreciated in the light of an historical survey of the various stages which have led up to it and
            the social conditions by which they were determined. The history of state education in England begins tardily in 1832, when after a generation of
            hesitation and controversy a beginning was made upon an exceedingly modest scale with the system of treasury grants in aid of elementary schools.
            The diverse forces which were at that date at work in the education of the nation as a whole, retarding state interference and marking out the
            limits within which it was long to be confined, derive their origin from a much remoter period.</p>

          <p>The apprenticeship laws of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII.</name> contain the earliest germ
            of state interference. These laws obliged children between five and thirteen years of age who were found begging or idle to be bound apprentices to
            some handicraft. If the immediate object was the prevention of crime rather than education as such, this early legislation is at least significant
            of the primary and intimate connexion that exists between popular education and industrial and economic needs. Yet in the shaping of the educational
            system the original influences were religious rather than economic ; hence the importance of the canons of 1604, which secured the control of
            education to <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established Church</name>. This of course was no novel
            doctrine, but merely the reaffirmation by the Reformed Church of the Catholic tradition of religious exclusiveness, presenting itself to the mind of
            contemporaries rather as the recognition of a national, that was also a religious, duty than as the assumption of an ecclesiastical privilege.
            Whatever mischief the Tudor statesmen wrought by indiscriminate destruction of chantries and other foundations which combined educational work with
            observances that the new religion branded as superstitious, however far the English Reformation fell short of the organized enthusiasm for popular
            education and culture that marked the first most vigorous and constructive period of Lutheranism in Germany, the Protestant, and especially the
            Puritan, spirit unquestionably inspired a considerable volume of individual educational effort during the latter half of the 16th and the first half
            of the 17th centuries. Here, as in Germany, the influence of the Reformation was wholly on the side of classicism, the dead languages being the key
            to the theological learning which was of primary concern to the men of that theological age. The conception of elementary education as a system
            complete in itself and adapted to the needs of the masses of the people was unfamiliar at this date. The earliest elementary schools were <foreign
              xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">petits</hi></foreign> schools, which (as the name implies) were really preparatory departments of the
            grammar-schools. Education in fact was still regarded as the privilege of an elite, but, as in the middle ages, the elite for whom it was sought to
            provide a ladder to the university by means of the endowed schools so numerously founded about this time was an elite of intellect and not of mere
            wealth; the class feeling which became so marked a feature of English higher education was of much later growth.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rise of elementary education.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Towards the end of the 17th century elementary education began to differentiate itself, partly by way of reaction against the unnatural classicism
            of the preceding age, but more especially as the result of the growth of towns and the creation of a considerable industrial population. At the
            close of the century the moral evils attendant upon industrialism alarmed the religious conscience and prompted one of the great educational
            movements that stand to the credit of the national church. In 1699 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Bray">Dr Bray</name>
            founded <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Society_for_Promoting_Christian_Knowledge">the Society for the Promotion of
              Christian Knowledge</name>, and the movement thereby initiated may be traced in the numerous <q>" charity "</q> or <q>" Blue Coat"</q> schools
            scattered plentifully throughout the country and especially in the great centres of population. The foundation of these schools, which was pushed
            forward with vigour during the early years of the 18th century, represents an energetic and wellplanned attempt to cope with the social evil of
            poverty by educational means. The instruction was elementary, the scholars were clothed as well as taught free, and the schools in the first
            instance were supported not so much by permanent endowment <pb n="972"/> as by voluntary effort, so that with this movement the voluntary system may
            be said to make its appearance. Lastly, all these philanthropic efforts were inspired by a solid but sober piety nurtured by a church which came
            nearer than at any other period of its history to enjoying the undivided allegiance of the people. Another notable movement in connexion with the
            church was one confined to Wales, that of the Welsh <q>" circulating schools "</q> established by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Griffith_Jones_(Llanddowror)">Griffith Jones</name> about 1730, consisting of an organized staff of schoolmasters
            who went round teaching adults to read <title>the Bible</title> in Welsh. In the English rural parishes the comparative religious unanimity favoured
            the quiet development of elementary education in a small way upon less specifically religious lines. Numerous small endowments for the elementary
            education of poor children were provided by well-to-do parishioners ; indeed to such an extent did the practice of making charitable (and largely
            educational) bequests increase that the legislature intervened in the interest of private inheritance by reviving the law of mortmain in an act of
            1736. The village schoolmaster became a feature of rural life, frequently enjoying a schoolhouse provided sometimes by endowment and sometimes even
            directly by the parishioners at the cost of the rate levied by the vestry, but more often aided only by a little stipend from an endowment for
            teaching poor children, and eking out an always scanty subsistence by the fees of such paying scholars as he could succeed in getting together.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of the 18th century the emergency of the industrial revolution evoked a fresh religious effort upon a more highly organized scale

              >Raikes</name> is rightly regarded as the founder of the English Sunday school. The peculiar value of the Sunday-school system in its early days
            lay in the combination of secular with religious instruction ; in many cases the school was held on Saturday as well as Sunday, and its restriction
            to the one day or two days was due to the prevalence of child labour under stress of the great industrial expansion. With better economic conditions
            and with the development of day schools the Sunday schools gradually became restricted in function to purely religious instruction. Even with this
            limitation there is no doubt that the great Sunday-school organizations of the various churches still deserve to be reckoned among the educational
            assets of the nation, and as agencies both of religious instruction and of general culture they may tend, under modern educational and religious
            developments, to play an increasingly important part.</p>

          <p>At the end of the 18th century the development of industry and the social unrest which followed the French Revolution combined to bring home to the
            public mind the need of a national system of day schools. Unfortunately, just at this moment the revival of Nonconformity as the result of the
            religious vitality of the Evangelical movement shattered the religious peace of the early Hanoverian period and divided the nation once more into
            hostile camps, to which class distinctions lent additional bitterness. The famous controversy between <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrew_Bell_(educationalist)">Andrew Bell</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Joseph Lancaster</name> and their respective followers in the opening years of the 19th centuiy
            served to define the religious difficulty substantially in the form in which it exists after the lapse of a century for the present generation. Both
            these remarkable men conceived independently the idea of a national system of popular education upon a voluntary basis; both concurred in extolling
            the merits of the monitorial system, which each claimed to have originated. The controversy between them, begun upon personal grounds, resolved
            itself into a national contest of rival principles of religious teaching. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster"
              >Lancaster</name> as a young Quaker schoolmaster, confronted with pupils drawn from various religious bodies, planned his religious instruction
            upon the lines of doctrine common to all the orthodox Christian denominations. Thus he is the father of the undenominational religious teaching
            which later formed the basis of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple"
              >Cowper-Temple</name> compromise. But whereas <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> is purely negative in form and so seems to point to an

            not merely upon the question of the exclusion of dogmatic formularies, but also upon the question of the control of whatever religious teaching

            permanent appropriation of the site to purposes of education, and the permanent right of government inspection; it must, however, be noted that this
            latter right was generally limited in terms to the inspection provided for by the minute of August 10, 1840. A conscience clause was not obligatory,
            and indeed was only offered in the limited form of exemption from instruction in formularies and attendance at Sunday school or public worship. A
            more systematic attempt to promote public control by means of trust deeds in 1846 led <name type="institution">the Committee of Council</name> into
            a controversy with <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Society_for_Promoting_Religious_Education">the National
              Society</name> which extended over a period of three years, turning chiefly upon the management clauses and the question of appeals, and resulting
            in compromises which constituted a fresh concordat with the church. In point of fact, the management clauses proved to be of little practical
            consequence, save in a few controversial cases, until <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>, which had
            the effect of bringing them once more into prominence in connexion with the constitution of statutory bodies of foundation managers. <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act of 1902</title> also dealt specifically with two other points arising upon the old
            trust deeds, viz. the control of religious instruction and the appeal to the bishop in religious questions. Special facilities for the conveyance of
            land for school purposes were afforded to limited owners by <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School_Sites_Act_1841">the School Sites Acts of
              1841</title> and subsequent years. The landed gentry responded with great public spirit to the call thus made upon their generosity by the state,
            with the result that the vast majority of rural, and many urban, parishes were freely endowed with sites for elementary schools.</p>

            Scholarships to assist pupil teachers to proceed to a training college ; they also established capitation grants for the support of such colleges,
            and annual grants to elementary schools under government inspection of from £15 to £30 in aid of the salary of every trained teacher employed.

          <p>During the middle years of the century various unsuccessful legislative attempts were made to establish a national system of elementary schools
            upon the basis of rate-aid. These attempts began with the education clauses of <ref><name type="person"

            of bills from 1853 to 1857, of which one set was introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell"
              >Lord John Russell</name> on behalf of the Whig government, whilst a second was promoted by an organization called <name type="institution">the

              type="institution">the Lancashire (afterwards the National) Public Schools Association</name>, in the secular interest. The only one of these
            attempts which calls for notice here is the bill introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Russell,_1st_Earl_Russell"
              >Lord John Russell</name> (called <title>the Borough Bill</title>, on account of its being restricted to municipal boroughs) in 1853, and forming
            part of a comprehensive scheme of legislative and administrative reform of which a portion was actually carried into effect. The bill as a measure
            for elementary education was supplemented by an administrative system of capitation grants for rural areas. The government scheme also comprised a
            measure dealing with the administration of charitable trusts (which took shape as <title>the Charitable Trusts Act 1853</title>), the constitution
            of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_and_Art_Department">the Department of Science and Art</name>, and university

            municipalities to adopt the act. It provided for the appointment of a school committee, one half of whose members might be non-members of the
            council. The school committee was merely given power to assist existing voluntary schools out of the rates. No provision was made for public control
            beyond the requirement of audit; the sole condition as to religious instruction was the acceptance of a conscience clause.</p>

          <p>The failure of <title>the Borough Bill</title> did not affect the new system of capitation grants which was introduced by minute of <name
              type="institution">the Committee of Council</name> dated April 2, 1853. These grants were fixed at a scale varying from 3s. to 6s. per head,
            payable upon certain conditions, of which the most important were that the school must be under a certificated teacher, and that three-fourths of
            the children must pass a prescribed examination. In consequence of the failure of the several fresh bills introduced in 1855 by the government, the
            church party and the secular party respectively amplifying the proposals previously brought forward, the capitation grant was, by minute of January
            26, 1856, extended to urban areas. As in the case of all the early grants, the regulations governing the distribution of the capitation grants were
            framed upon the principle that subventions of public money must be met by local funds derived from voluntary contributions, endowments and school
            fees; thus the basis of the denominational system as fostered by the state at this stage was one of financial partnership.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="article"><hi rend="bold">Newcastle commission.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The progress of state-aided education during this period may be measured by the increase of the annual parliamentary grant, which rose from £30,000
            in 1839 to £100,000 in 1846, £I50,000 in 1851, £396,000 in 1855, and £663,400 in l858. This expansion was viewed with misgiving by the friends of
            the denominational system, and by the strong individualist school of that day, who upon wider grounds clung to the old ideal of voluntary
            initiative. These sections combined with the advocates of further state intervention to press for a commission of inquiry, and at the instance of
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John Pakington</name> (the eminent Conservative
            educationist who was responsible for the denominational bills of the fifties) a royal commission was appointed in 1858, under the chairmanship of
            the duke of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">Newcastle</name>, to inquire into the state of popular
            education in England, and to consider and report what measures, if any, were required for the extension of sound and cheap elementary instruction to
            all classes of the people. <title>The Report of the Newcastle Commission</title>, issued in 1861, contains an exhaustive account of the existing
            condition of elementary education, and, with due allowance for the grave defects revealed, and in particular the glaring inefficiency of the
            numerous little private-venture schools kept by <q>" dames"</q> and others, the graphic picture drawn by the commissioners constitutes a striking
            tribute to the sterling qualities of self-help and religious earnestness which were so characteristic of the early Victorian period. It was found
            that in round numbers about 2,500,000 children were attending day schools, the proportion to population being 1 in 7, as compared with 1 in 9 in
            France, 1 in 8 in Holland, and 1 in 6 in Prussia, where education was compulsory. On the other hand, of this number only 1,675,000 were in public
            schools of all kinds, only 1,100,000 in schools liable to inspection, and 917,000 in schools receiving annual grant. The result was that only one
            child in every twenty was attending a school whose efficiency could be in any way guaranteed by the state. In the constructive portion of their work
            the comments and recommendations of the commissioners reflected the prevailing perplexity of the public mind. A consistent individualistic minority
            considered that the annual grant should be withdrawn altogether, and that any further state aid should be confined to building grants, which they
            would concede not as desirable in themselves but as necessitated out of considerations of fairness to the parishes that had not yet received such
            aid. The commissioners as a body rejected free and compulsory education in view of the religious difficulty and upon general grounds of
            individualistic principle. Of the religious difficulty itself the commissioners had some wise words to say which hold good in substance at the
            present time. In their judgment the considerable evidence they had amassed conclusively proved that the religious difficulty originated with the
            managers, promoters and organizers of the schools, and not with the parents themselves ; yet the indifferent or comparatively passive attitude of
            the people nowise materially diminished the practical difficulty of introducing a comprehensive system, since it was not with the body of the people
            but with the founders and supporters of schools that legislators would always have to deal. In view of the solution adopted in 1902 it is of
            interest to note that the Newcastle Commissioners deliberately rejected the parish as unfit to be taken as the unit of elementary education upon the
            ground that management by parochial ratepayers must tend to be illiberal and niggardly, bent upon economy of the rates to the detriment of
            educational interests; accordingly they recommended the constitution of county boards (which in the absence of elective councils must needs
            originate with quarter sessions) clothed with power to levy a rate for the aid of existing voluntary schools.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Payment by results.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The one definite achievement of <name type="institution">the Newcastle Commission</name> was the famous system of payment by results, which may be
            said to have excited a keener and more prolonged controversy than any other measure of a purely educational character. Impressed by the defects of
            the existing teaching, the commissioners reported that there was only one way of securing efficiency, and that was to institute a searching
            examination by competent authority of every child in every school to which grants were to be paid, with the view of ascertaining whether the
            indispensable elements of knowledge were thoroughly acquired, and to make the prospects and position of the teacher dependent to a considerable
            extent upon the results of this examination. Thus the commissioners hoped to counteract what appeared to them to be the crying defect of the
            existing training college system, viz. that it tended mainly to adapt the young schoolmaster to advance his higher, rather than to thoroughly ground
            his junior, pupils. They recognized that to raise the character of the children, both morally and intellectually, was and must always be the highest
            aim of education, and they were far from desiring to supersede this by any plan of a mere examination into the more mechanical <pb n="975"/> work of
            elementary education, the reading, writing and arithmetic of young children; but they thought that the importance of this training, which must be
            the foundation of all other teaching, had been lost sight of, and that there was justice in the common complaint that while a fourth of the scholars
            were really taught, three-fourths after leaving school forgot everything they had learnt there.</p>

            the voluntary managers, and even as a breach of faith with the great religious denominations. On purely educational grounds, which need not be here

          <p>The years immediately preceding 1870 were occupied with discussion and preparation for the great legislative measure for which the time was now

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John Pakington</name> presided. For reasons connected with the political
            situation of the moment this committee never reported, but the minutes of evidence and the draft report prepared by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Pakington,_1st_Baron_Hampton">Sir John Pakington</name> contained much valuable material in the way of
            criticism of the existing system and suggestion for the coming settlement; in particular the draft report insisted upon the inevitableness of an
            education rate. In 1868 the Conservative government brought in, but did not proceed with, an education bill deliberately discarding the principle of
            rate-aid on the ground that it would destroy voluntary contributions and gradually starve out the denominational schools. In 1867 and again in 1868
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Bruce,_1st_Baron_Aberdare">Mr Bruce (afterwards Lord Aberdare)</name>, <name

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algernon_Egerton">Mr Algernon Egerton</name> introduced a bill which formed the basis of the measure of 1870. As

            coadjutors proposed a universal system of municipal and parochial rating with liberty for voluntary schools to unite themselves to the rate-aided
            system under their existing management, subject to the acceptance of a conscience clause. The bill also proposed to empower town councils to co-opt
            outsiders upon their education committees. Thus both in the principle of co-optation and in the extension of rate-aid to schools not under public

          <p><title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elementary_Education_Act_1870">The Elementary Education Act of 1870</title> bore in every respect the marks
            of compromise. As <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Edward_Forster">Mr Forster</name> explained in introducing the
              bill, the object of the government was <quote>" to complete the voluntary system and to fill up gaps,"</quote></ref> not to supplant it. To this
            end <name type="institution">the Education Department</name> was charged with the duty of ascertaining whether or not there was in every parish a
            deficiency of public school accommodation, and provision made for the formation of school boards in every school district (i.e. parish or municipal
            borough) requiring further public school accommodation. Such accommodation might consist either of public elementary schools as defined by the act,
            or other schools giving efficient and suitable elementary education. The definition of public elementary school contained in section 7 of the act is
            still in force. Shortly, a public elementary school is a school subject to a conscience clause entitling scholars to complete exemption from all
            religious instruction and observance whatsoever. Any religious instruction or observance in the school must be either at the beginning or the end of
            the school meeting. The school must also be open at all times to the government inspectors and must be conducted in accordance with the conditions
            required to be fulfilled in order to obtain an annual parliamentary grant. In the same connexion an important change was made in the conditions of
            inspection by declaring that it should be no part of the duties of the inspector to inquire into religious instruction, whilst a later section of
            the act provided that no parliamentary grant should be made in respect of any religious instruction.</p>
          <p>Three important changes were made in the measure during its passage through parliament. As at first proposed, <list>
              <item>(1) the school boards were not to be directly elected by the ratepayers, but were to be appointed by the town council or the vestry.</item>
              <item>(2) These nominated boards were empowered either to provide schools themselves or to assist existing public elementary schools, provided
                that such assistance was granted on equal terms to all such schools, upon conditions to be approved by <name type="institution">the Education
                  Department</name>. Thus the school board, if it exercised the option of assisting denominational schools, would have been obliged to assist
                all or none.</item>
              <item>(3) With regard to its own schools, the school board was to settle the form of religious instruction.</item>
            </list> These proposals raised serious opposition in the country, and when the committee stage of the bill was reached two fundamental changes were
            made in the policy of the bill. In the first place, as <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Gladstone">Mr
                Gladstone</name> put it, the government had decided <quote>" to sever altogether the tie between the local board and the voluntary
                schools."</quote></ref> In lieu of the suggested rate-aid they proposed an increased grant from <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HM_Treasury">the treasury</name>, that is to say, the voluntary schools were left standing as state-aided schools
            under private management, side by side with the new rate-supported schools.</p>

        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Cowper-Temple clause.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Next, the character of the religious instruction in the board schools was determined upon an undenominational basis by a provision which has become
            known to history after the name of its author, then <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Mr Cowper-Temple</name>, as <title>the Cowper-Temple
                clause</title> (section 14 of the act), directing that <quote>"no religious catechism or religious formulary which is distinctive of any
                particular denomination shall be taught in the school."</quote></ref> The clause was not intended to exclude doctrinal exposition, and was in
            fact a compromise not merely between absolute secularism and denominationalism, but between denominationalism and the view of those who would have
              <title>the Bible</title> read without note or comment. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apostles'_Creed">The Apostles' Creed</title> as a

            establishment in the schools, upon the lines laid down by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Joseph

              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Mr Disraeli</name> urged that a religion without formularies was in fact a new
            religion, and that in leaving its exposition to the teachers we were creating a new sacerdotal class, the <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise, notwithstanding its inherent want
            of logic, stood the test of experience for more than a generation against the consistent denominationalists on the one hand and the party of secular
            education on the other. It is important to observe that the act of 1870 left the giving of <pb n="976"/> religious instruction, whether in voluntary
            schools (in which its inclusion might be assumed as of course) or in board schools, purely permissive. In practice it was only in Wales that school
            boards availed themselves to any extent of the liberty to abstain from giving religious instruction, and this comparative secularism of Wales
            certainly argued no lack of religious life among the people.</p>
          <p>The third change in the bill was the substitution of the ad hoc school board for the municipally appointed board originally proposed, a change
            which commended itself in view of the special difficulty presented by the case of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London"
              >London</name>. These boards were elected by the system of cumulative voting under which each elector had as many votes as there were candidates
            to be elected, with liberty to give all his votes to one candidate or to distribute them amongst the candidates as he thought fit. This system was
            much criticized as being unduly favourable to minorities, whose representation it was devised to secure ; it continued, however, until the
            supersession of the <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi></foreign> authorities by committees of the county and urban councils under
              <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>.</p>
          <p>School boards were empowered not only to acquire sites for schools under powers of compulsory purchase, but also to take transfers of existing
            voluntary schools from their managers. The section which enables managers to transfer schools to the school board or local education authority for
            the purpose of board or council schools freed from religious trusts unquestionably marks an important inroad by the state upon the sanctity of
            trusts. Thus though the act of 1870 did not itself introduce the principle of compulsory transfer, it formed the point of departure for the
            proposals in this direction which were the basis of the unsuccessful bills of 1906 and 1908. The act of 1870 did not introduce either direct
            compulsory attendance or free education, but it took a distinct step forward in each direction by enabling school boards to frame by-laws rendering
            attendance compulsory, and also to pay the school fees in the case of poverty of the parent.</p>
          <p>The policy of compromise between the two systems of voluntary and rate-established schools was carried out in the provisions relating to the future
            supply of schools. On the one hand, building grants were continued temporarily for the benefit of those who applied (as voluntary managers alone
            could apply) before the 31st of December 1870. On the other hand, <name type="institution">the Education Department</name> was authorized to refuse
            parliamentary grants to schools established in school board districts after the passing of the act if they thought such schools unnecessary.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Progress under the act of 1870.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The following figures are of interest as showing the progress made under the act of 1870. In the year 1870 there was accommodation in inspected day
            schools for about 2,000,000 children ; the average attendance was 1,168,000, and the number on the books about 1,500,000. It was computed, however,
            that there were, exclusive of the well-to-do classes, at least 1,500,000 children who attended no school at all or schools not under inspection. In
            1876 accommodation had been provided for nearly 3,500,000, and of the 1,500,000 new places nearly two-thirds were provided by voluntary agencies.
                <ref><quote>" These voluntary agencies," says <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sir_Henry_Craik,_1st_Baronet">Sir H.
                  Craik</name>, " had received grants in aid for about one-third of the schools they had built, the grants defraying about one-fifth of the cost
                of the aided schools."</quote></ref> On the other hand, the growth of school boards was rapid and continuous, notwithstanding the permissive
            character of the act and the strenuous efforts of the voluntaryists to keep pace with the new demands. In 1872, 9,700,000 of the population were
            under school boards, and of these 8,142,000 were under by-laws; in 1876 the numbers were respectively 12,500,000 and 10,400,000. In the same period
            the annual grants increased from £894,000 in 1870 to £1,600,000 in 1876.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Act of 1876.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The development evidenced by the above figures, and in particular the fact that 52 % of the population were subject to by-laws, enabled <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benjamin_Disraeli">Mr Disraeli</name>'s government in 1876 to take a notable step forward in the
            direction of universal direct compulsion. The act of 1876 embodied the declaration that <quote>" it shall be the duty of the parent of every child
              to cause such child to receive efficient elementary instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic, and if such parent fail to perform such duty
              he shall be liable to such orders and penalties as are provided by the Act "</quote> ; next, it rendered an employer liable to a penalty who took
            into his employment a child under the age of ten years, or a child between the ages of ten and fourteen years who had not obtained the required
            certificate of proficiency in reading, writing and arithmetic, or of previous attendance at a certified efficient school. In order to complete the
            machinery for compulsion, the act directed that, in every district where there was no school board, a school attendance committee should be
            appointed by the local authority. The law as to school attendance, resting upon this and subsequent enactments, is complicated and in some details
            obscure. The subject was dealt with in the report of an inter-departmental committee in 1900, who recommended the abolition of the partial
            exemptions permitted, and the raising of the age of exemption to 13.</p>

            of 1876 and 1880 the average attendance increased from 2,000,000 in 1876 to 3,500,000 in 1878 and 4,000,000 in 1881 ; in terms of percentage to
            population, 8-06 in 1876, 9-60 in 1878, and 10-69 in 1881. In the last-mentioned year the annual grant rose to £2,200,000, having more than doubled

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Development of public opinion.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>With the passing of <title>the Elementary Education Act 1880</title> the education question entered upon a new phase. The country was now possessed
            of a national system of elementary education, in the sense that provision was made for the supply of efficient schools and for compulsory
            attendance. The question of free education was brought within the range of practical politics by the adoption of universal compulsion, but as yet it
            was advocated only by a small political group of pronounced collectivist tendencies. Whilst opinion was maturing on this topic, there began to force
            itself upon the public mind the vastly more difficult problem of combining the two systems of voluntary, denominational, state-aided schools on the
            one hand, and public, undenominational, rate-supported schools on the other. From the denominational point of view the problem presented itself as
            that of a burden imposed and a danger threatened in ever-increasing degree by the competition of the board schools, a competition that was felt not
            so much by direct rivalry of school with school as indirectly by the steady raising of the standard of efficiency with respect to buildings,
            equipment, salaries of teachers and educational attainment which inevitably resulted from the establishment of authorities with power to draw upon
            the rates. On the other hand, from the purely educational point of view, it was seen that the dual system tended in practice to an illicit but
            almost inevitable recognition of two standards of efficiency, the lower being conceded to voluntary schools in consideration of their comparative
            poverty. Experience, too, of the shortcomings of small country school boards was beginning to confirm the misgivings entertained long before by the
            Newcastle Commissioners as to the wisdom of entrusting autonomous powers to the parish, when the reform of local government by the creation of
            popularly elected county authorities turned attention once more to the question of organizing education upon a county basis.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Cross Commission, 1887.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>In 1887 a royal commission under the presidency of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._A._Cross,_1st_Viscount_Cross">Viscount
              Cross</name> was appointed to inquire into the working of the education acts. The labours of this commission produced a thorough discussion of the
            educational problem in all its aspects, political, administrative, scholastic and religious. For any clear recommendations with regard to the
            reorganization of education generally the moment was not opportune, inasmuch as the commission just preceded the establishment of the new county
            authorities and the powers with respect to instruction other than elementary which parliament was shortly to confide to them under <title>the
              Technical Instruction Acts</title>. Nevertheless the report of the majority of the <pb n="977"/> commissioners pointed unmistakably towards the
            solution adopted in <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>, and their definite recommendation that
            voluntary schools should be accorded rate-aid without the imposition of <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title>, served as the basis of that
            legislation. The commission brought into strong relief the opposing currents of thought in educational politics, the majority report, representing
            the principles of denominationalism, being balanced by a strong minority report embodying the views of those who looked for progress along the lines
            of the school-board system. Taken together, the two reports form a comprehensive survey of the difficulties which still in the main beset public
            education in this country.</p>

            report, it is convenient to mention in the first place, out of chronological sequence, the practical establishment of free education by the act of
            l891 not by the absolute prohibition of school fees but by the device of a special grant payable by parliament in lieu of fees, called the fee
            grant. The result of this legislation and of subsequent administrative action was to place free education within the reach of every child, fees
            being retained (with few exceptions) only where some instruction of a higher elementary type was given.</p>

            introduced a new factor which was destined to exert a determining influence upon subsequent developments of public education. In the first place, it
            at once rendered possible the partial and experimental provision for higher education attempted by <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>,
            which affected secondary education as well as technical education in the proper sense of the term. In order to understand the state of secondary
            education at this period, it is necessary to refer back to the first attempts made to deal with secondary education a generation earlier.</p>

              Commission of 1894)</ref> remains the best introduction to the problem of public secondary education in England. The existence of numerous and
            frequently very wealthy endowments arising from private benefactions and bequests has at all times been a feature in education as in other
            departments of English social life. In the organization of secondary education in particular, private endowments have played and continue still to
            play a part which cannot be paralleled in any other country. This circumstance has undoubtedly resulted in a great economy of resources, though in
            numerous instances the difficulties occasioned by the haphazard distribution of endowments and the local jealousies invariably aroused by any
            attempt to readjust their areas to modern conditions have obstructed useful reform and proved a source of misdirected and wasted effort. At the date
            of <name type="institution">the Schools Inquiry Commission</name> the state of the ancient endowments was largely one of abuse. Very many endowments
            intended for advanced education were applied for instruction of a purely elementary character, and that of an inferior kind ; indeed the possession
            of an endowment in a rural locality not infrequently operated to prevent the establishment of an efficient state-aided school. The evidence showed
            that the proportion of scholars in the country grammar-schools who were receiving some tincture of the classical education intended by the founders
            was steadily decreasing, and nothing had been done to bring the curriculum into harmony with the actual needs of the time. No doubt a small elite of
            classical scholars were sent to the older universities by these schools, but in the main they were in a feeble and decadent state, giving, more or
            less inefficiently, an education wholly unsuited to the wants of the class to whom they ministered. In addition to the general inelasticity of the
            curriculum, the special evils from which the grammar-schools suffered were the want of effective governing bodies and the freehold tenure of the
            headmasterships.</p>

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools Acts</title> the presumption is reversed, and ancient trusts are
            treated as free from denominational restrictions, save in virtue of express conditions imposed by or under the authority of the founder. The result
            was that in framing schemes for the reorganization of ancient endowed schools the commissioners found themselves able to treat the majority of cases
            as undenominational. In such cases the general practice was to direct that instruction should, subject to a strict conscience clause, be given in
            the principles of the Christian faith; this provision corresponded in a way to <title>the Cowper-Temple clause</title> in elementary education, with
            the important distinction that it was positive, not negative, and did not exclude special doctrinal instruction.</p>

          <p>Besides the recommendations for the reform of endowed schools, to which substantial effect was given directly or indirectly by means of <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools Acts</title>, <name type="institution">the Schools Inquiry
              Commission</name> also submitted proposals for the general administrative organization of a system of secondary education. They recommended the
            establishment of three authorities— <list>
              <item>(1) a central authority;</item>
              <item>(2) a local or provincial authority, representing the county or a group of counties, with a certain jurisdiction both in proposing schemes
                for the reform of endowed schools in their area (such as that afterwards conferred upon the joint education committees under <name
                  type="institution">the Welsh Intermediate Education Act</name>), and in administering these schools;</item>
              <item>and (3) a central council of education charged with examination duties</item>
            </list>. Further, it was proposed to raise the level of proprietary and private schools by offering them inspection and examination and by
            establishing a system of school registration. Lastly, in order that the supply of public secondary schools might not be dependent upon endowments,
            it was proposed to confer upon towns and parishes powers of rating for the establishment of new schools. For these proposals as a whole the time was
            not ripe. The bill of 1869 as originally introduced in <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of
              Commons</name> attempted to give effect, with some variations, <pb n="978"/> to one of these suggestions, namely, that for the creation of a
            central council, but exigencies of parliamentary time made it necessary to drop this part of the measure ; the result was that the plan of the
            commissioners was only half carried out. Nevertheless, owing to the multiplicity and wealth of endowments, the work accomplished was sufficient to
            exert a considerable influence upon the secondary education of the country. Thus in 1895 <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bryce,_1st_Viscount_Bryce">Mr Bryce</name>'s Commission was able to report that schemes under <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools Acts</title> had been made for 902 endowments in England, excluding
            Wales and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monmouth">Monmouth</name>, leaving only 546 endowments out of the total of 1448
            endowments in England known to be subject to the Endowed Schools Acts, which had not felt the reforming hand of the commissioners. The total income
            of the endowments known to be subject to <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endowed_Schools_Act_1869">the Endowed Schools Acts</title>, and
            therefore available for purposes of secondary education, according to the estimate of <name type="institution">the Secondary Education
              Commission</name> (still in 1909 the latest available source of complete information), was in 1895 about £735,000 gross.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after <name type="institution">the Schools Inquiry Commission</name> the creation by <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_Government_Act_1888">the Local Government Act 1888</title> of the representative and popular county
            authorities of which the need had been felt by reformers alike in secondary and elementary education, rendered the first step in the direction of
            the municipalization of secondary instruction at last possible. In 1889 <title>the Technical Instruction Act</title> (extended in some particulars
            by an act of 1891) empowered the councils of counties, boroughs and urban districts to levy a rate (not exceeding a penny in the pound) for the
            support or aid of technical or manual instruction. Comparatively few councils were prepared to resort to their rating powers, but progress under
            these acts was greatly facilitated by <title>the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act of 1890</title>, which mentioned technical instruction as
            one of the purposes to which the imperial contribution paid to local authorities in respect of the beer and spirit duties might be applied. By
            virtue of the very liberal interpretation given to technical instruction by these acts the financial assistance afforded under them was extended to
            cover the whole field of mathematical and physical science, as well as modern languages.</p>

            in the development of secondary education upon the same lines as <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>, administering a parliamentary grant
            which was gradually extended with a view to encouraging literary studies as well as the scientific and mathematical subjects to the promotion of
            which it was primarily directed. Thus the combined effect of the local resources available under <title>the Technical Instruction Act</title> and
            the imperial grant administered by the department was gradually to develop a national system of secondary education with a marked bias on the side
            of physical science.</p>

          <p>An undoubted stimulus was given to secondary education in the great centres of industry during the last quarter of the 19tn century by the rise of
            the new university colleges, among which must be reckoned those established expressly for women. In the main the influence of these new institutions
            made for a non-classical and scientific type of curriculum in the popular secondary schools.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Influence of school boards.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>At the same time, the pressure of the school boards influenced secondary education in two ways. In the first place, the elementary schools were
            found to act as feeders for schools of a higher type, and the idea of the <q>" educational ladder "</q> began to play a leading part in plans for
            the organization of national education. It was seen that there must be schools to which the more advanced scholars could pass from the public
            elementary schools, and scholarships to assist such scholars to continue their education in this way. In the next place, it was recognized that to
            provide adequately for the further education of public elementary scholars a new type of school was required. Thus there came into being through the
            initiative of the great school boards what were known as higher-grade elementary schools. These were really secondary schools of the third grade,
            and, as <name type="institution">the Commission on Secondary Education</name> observed, the school boards simply stepped in to fill the educational
            void which the Schools Inquiry Commissioners had proposed to fill by schools of that name. The happy obscurity of the legal definition of elementary
            education left these schools free to develop during the long years of the neglect of secondary education by the state, and when in 1901 the famous
            judgment in the test case of <title><hi rend="italic">Rex v. Cockerton</hi></title> pronounced them to be illegal, it was at once recognized that
            the legislature must without delay step in to secure the educational work which the undoubtedly correct principles of judicial interpretation had
            placed in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>Such were the agencies at work in the domain of secondary education when in 1894 a royal commission was appointed under the presidency of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bryce,_1st_Viscount_Bryce">Mr Bryce</name> to inquire into this branch of education. The
            terms of reference excluded elementary education, and the report may be taken as embodying the views of that school of educational statesmen who
            held that progress would best be attained by keeping elementary and secondary education entirely separate for purposes of local administration, the
            parish being regarded as the natural unit for elementary and the county for secondary education, a topic to which it will be necessary to revert in
            connexion with <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title>. The principal recommendations of the commission
            were: <list>
              <item>(1) the unification of the existing central authorities, viz. <name type="institution"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_and_Art_Department">the Department of Science and Art</name>, <name type="institution">the Charity
                  Commission</name> (so far as it dealt with educational endowments), and <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>, in one
                central office, and the establishment of an educational council to advise the minister of education in certain professional matters;</item>
              <item>(2) the establishment of local authorities, to consist of committees of the county councils with co-opted elements ;</item>
              <item>(3) the formation of a register of teachers with a view to the encouragement of professional training, and a system of school registration
                upon the basis of inspection and examination</item>
            </list>. The first of these recommendations was carried out by <name type="institution">the Board of Education Act 1899</name>, as mentioned below,
            and under the same act an attempt was made to give some effect to the third-named object, which, though it unfortunately fell short of success, may
            serve as a point of departure for further efforts. The realization of the second, and the most important, of the recommendations was deferred till
            1902, when it was brought about as a part of a wider reorganization of the educational system.</p>

          <p>The religious difficulty in elementary education during the period immediately succeeding the report of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bryce,_1st_Viscount_Bryce">Mr Bryce</name>'s Commission in 1895 once more reached an acute stage, and this
            circumstance was immediately unfavourable to a resolute handling of educational problems as such, public attention being largely concentrated upon
            the voluntary demand of the supporters of voluntary schools for relief from the growing financial burden which was laid upon them by that steady
            raising of the standard to which reference has been made above. In 1896 an endeavour was made to meet the demands of the voluntary managers by means
            of a bill introduced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Eldon_Gorst">Sir John Gorst</name> on behalf of the Conservative
            government. This bill with its provision for a special aid grant to be administered by county education authorities, which were to exist side by
            side with the school boards, represented a kind of compromise between the systems of 1870 and 1902. It encountered opposition in all quarters and
            was withdrawn. In 1897, however, the position of the denominational schools was strengthened by <title>the Voluntary Schools Act</title>, which
            provided for a special aid grant of five shillings per head of the scholars in average attendance in these schools.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Act of 1902, general principles.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>No law of recent years has excited an acuter or more prolonged controversy than <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the
              Education Act of 1902</title>, and amid the dust of religious and political strife it is not easy for contemporaries to view it objectively and in
            its true proportions. Nevertheless, considered historically, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> becomes
            intelligible as the product of the forces, partly religious and partly educational, which have been already described. The immediate impulse for
            this measure must be sought in the agitation that during the preceding decade had been gathering force among the adherents of <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Established</name> and <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</name> churches for equality of financial treatment as between voluntary
            and board schools. It must be placed to the credit of the constructive statesmanship of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_(UK)">the Conservative party</name> that it availed itself of an ecclesiastical agitation to
            take an important step forward in the organization of national education. The difficulty inherent in such a measure was the admitted difficulty of
            securing public control, as a necessary concomitant of public maintenance, without jeopardizing or destroying the special religious character of the
            voluntary schools. <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act of 1902</title> sought to solve this problem, so difficult of
            solution under democratic conditions, upon the principle of a division of financial responsibility justifying a corresponding division of control
            between the voluntary managers and the local authority. The constitution of the local authority to be charged not only with the delicate duty of
            participating in the dual control of the voluntary public elementary schools, but also with the responsible task of co-ordinating public higher with
            public elementary education, presented features of controversy only less formidable than the purely religious question itself. Boldly reversing the
            settlement of 1870, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title> abolished the parochial school boards, and
            with them the system of <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi></foreign> election, and made the county councils, already seised of
            technical and secondary education under <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>, the local authorities for all forms of education, thus
            reverting to the solution propounded by Conservative statesmanship in the middle period of the 19th century and endorsed by an important memorandum
            contributed by <name type="person">Lord Sandford</name> (formerly permanent secretary of <name type="institution">the Education Department</name>)
            to the report of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/R._A._Cross,_1st_Viscount_Cross">Cross</name> Commission. The
            unquestionable niggardliness and inefficiency of many small country school boards, which had been foretold by the prescience of the <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">Newcastle</name> Commissioners, constituted the chief educational argument for
            the selection of the wider area so far as the interests of elementary education alone were concerned. On the other hand, experience has shown that
            in the rural districts against the undoubted gain in general efficiency there must be set a certain loss on account of the decay of local and
            personal interest consequent upon the centralization of authority in the hands of the county councils. Account, too, must be taken of the
            comparative heaviness with which a uniform county rate is apt to press upon sparsely populated agricultural parishes, especially in counties which
            include considerable industrial districts. Notwithstanding these minor drawbacks, it may be said that upon the whole the best opinion has endorsed
            the policy of 1902 with respect to the area of administration. At any rate it has been necessary to recognize the impracticability of
            disestablishing the strongly organized provincial authorities which <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title>
            brought into being, and proposals for amendment in this particular have been confined to schemes, favoured in principle by all parties, for securing
            some measure of decentralization and delegation of powers calculated to restore and stimulate local interest without derogating from the financial
            and administrative responsibility of the county council.</p>

          <p>The principal provisions of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title> may be summarized as follows:— <list>
              <item>Part I. Local Education Authority. The council of every county and of every county borough is the local education authority for the purposes
                of the act, i.e. for both higher and elementary education, but for the purpose of elementary education autonomous powers are conferred upon
                boroughs with a population of over 10,000, and urban districts with a population of over 20,000 (§ 1).</item>
              <item>Part II. Higher Education. <quote>" The L.E.A. (local education authority) shall consider the educational needs of their area and take such
                  steps as seem to them desirable, after consultation with <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, to supply or aid the supply
                  of education other than elementary, and to promote the general co-ordination of all forms of education."</quote> For this purpose the
                application of the money received by the local authority under <title>the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act 1890</title>, heretofore
                optional, is made compulsory, and power is given to levy a rate which in the case of a county is not to exceed two pence in the pound, or such
                higher rate as the county council with the consent of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Local_Government_Board">the
                  Local Government Board</name> may fix (§ 2). Concurrent powers are given to the councils of non-county boroughs and urban districts, with the
                limit of a penny rate (§3). A council must not require any particular form of religious instruction or observance, but the usual conscience
                clause in schools, colleges, or hostels provided by the council is modified by a provision for facilities for any particular religious
                instruction to be given at the request of parents of scholars at such times and under such conditions as the council think desirable, otherwise
                than at the cost of the council (§ 4).</item>
              <item>Part III. Elementary Education. <list>
                  <item>(1) Powers and duties. School boards and school attendance committees are abolished and their powers and duties are transferred to the
                    L.E.A., who are also to be responsible for and have the control of all secular instruction in public elementary schools not provided by them
                    (§ 5).</item>
                  <item>(2) Management of schools, <list>
                      <item>(a) For public elementary schools provided by the L.E.A. (now officially styled <q>" council schools "</q> ) : <list>
                          <item>(1) in counties, there is to be a body of six managers, viz. four appointed by the county council and two by the borough or
                            urban district council, or parish council or parish meeting as the case may be, called in the act the minor local authority ;</item>
                          <item>(2) in non-county areas, the L.E.A. (being the borough or urban district council) may, if they think fit, appoint a body of
                            managers consisting of such number as they may determine (§ 6 [1]).</item>
                        </list></item>
                      <item>(b) For schools not provided by the L.E.A, (voluntary schools) <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the
                          act</title> directs that there shall he a body of six managers, of whom four are to be <q>" foundation managers,"</q> and two are to

                        districts both by the borough or urban district council (§ 6 [2]). Directions for the appointment of foundation managers are given by §
                        11 , which in effect declares that, unless the trust deed of the school provides for the appointment of the required number, the
                        foundation managers must be appointed under an order of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, in making which the
                        board are to have regard to the ownership of the school building and to the principles on which the education given in the school had
                        been conducted in the past. It was found necessary for the board to make over 11,000 of these orders, a heavy task which was rendered
                        the more formidable by the controversial character of the questions arising upon trust deeds as to the mode of appointment and the
                        qualifications of managers.</item>

                      <item>(a) Powers. The L.E.A. are required to maintain and keep efficient all public elementary schools which were necessary (i.e. which,
                        as defined by § 9, have an average attendance of not less than thirty), under certain specified conditions, of which the most material
                        are as follows. The managers must carry out the directions of the L.E.A. as to the secular instruction to be given in the school,
                        including any directions with respect to the number and educational qualifications of the teachers, and for the dismissal of any teacher
                        on educational grounds (§ 7 [1] [a]). The consent of the L.E.A. is required to the appointment of teachers, but that consent may not be
                        withheld except on educational grounds; and the consent of the authority is also required to the dismissal of a teacher unless the
                        dismissal in on grounds connected with the giving of religious instruction (§ 7 [1] [c]).</item>
                      <item>(b) Liabilities. The managers are required to provide the school premises to the L.E.A, for use as a public elementary school free
                        of charge, except that a rent is payable for the teacher's residence where one exists; and the managers are further required out of
                        funds provided by them to keep the school premises in good repair and to make such alterations and improvements in the buildings as
                        might reasonably be required by the L.E.A. On the other hand, the L.E.A, are required to make good such damage as they consider to be
                        due to fair wear and tear of rooms used by them (§ 7 [1] [d]).</item>
                    </list><pb n="980"/> Thus, by virtue of the teacher's house rent and the wear-and-tear allowance the voluntary managers secured a valuable
                    set-off against the cost of ordinary repairs.</item>
                </list></item>
            </list></p>
          <p>Any question arising under this section (§ 7) between the L.E.A. and the managers of a voluntary school is to be determined by <name
              type="institution">the Board of Education</name> (§ 7 [3]).</p>
          <p>It is further provided with respect to teachers in voluntary schools that assistant teachers and pupil teachers may be appointed <quote>"if it is
              thought fit "</quote> without reference to religious creed and denomination. and in any case in which there are more candidates for the post of
            pupil teacher than there are places to be filled, the appointment is to be made by the L.E.A. (§ 7 [5]).</p>
          <p>A provision, § 7 (6), known from the name of its author (d. 1908), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney"
              >Colonel Kenyon Slaney, M.P.</name>, as the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name>
            clause, attracted considerable attention and formed the subject of much ecclesiastical controversy during the passage of the bill through
            parliament. The <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name> clause requires the religious
            instruction in voluntary schools to be in accordance with the provisions (if any) of the trust deed, but also to be under the control of the
            managers as a whole, whereas the common form of trust deed of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Society_for_Promoting_Religious_Education">the National Society</name> reserves the control of religious
            instruction to the clergyman, whilst the clause was equally in conflict with the well-known sacerdotal principles of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">the Roman Catholic Church</name>. Thus the clause represented a revival, as did the
            questions with respect to foundation managers, of the early controversy over the management clauses of <name type="institution">the Committee of
              Council on Education</name>. Its special interest lies, not so much in its intrinsic importance, as in the precedent it affords, specially notable
            as emanating from a Conservative source, for the overruling of trust deeds upon grounds of public policy. By way of saving another familiar
            provision of the trust deeds, a proviso to the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Kenyon-Slaney">Kenyon-Slaney</name>
            clause reserves the existing trust-deed rights of appeal to the bishop or other denominational authority as to the character of the religious
            instruction.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Provision of New Schools.</hi>—New schools may be provided either by the L.E.A. or any other persons, subject to the issue of
            three months' public notice, and to a right of appeal on the part of the managers of any existing school, the L.E.A. (in the case of proposed
            voluntary schools) or any ten ratepayers of the district, to <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> on the ground that the proposed
            school is not required, or that a school provided by the L.E.A., or not so provided, as the case might be, is better suited to meet the wants of the
            district than the proposed school. Any enlargement of a public elementary school which in the opinion of <name type="institution">the Board of
              Education</name> is such as to amount to the provision of a new school is to be so treated for the purposes of the section, and any transfer of a
            school to or from the L.E.A. must be treated as the provision of a new school. In deciding appeals as to new schools and in determining a case of
            dispute whether a school was necessary or not, <name type="institution">the board</name> are directed to have regard to the interest of secular
            instruction, the wishes of parents as to the education of children, and the economy of the rates, but existing schools are not to be considered
            unnecessary if the average attendance is not less than thirty (§§ 8-9). The last-mentioned canons have played a prominent part in subsequent
            discussions. Experience of these sections has shown that though it is extremely difficult to set up new voluntary schools in face of opposition from
            the L.E.A., such opposition is rarely offered or pressed where any really strong local demand is shown to exist.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Aid Grant.</hi>—Section 10 provides a new aid grant payable to the L.E.A. in respect of the number of scholars in average
            attendance in schools maintained by them. This new grant, calculated by an elaborate method which need not here be set out, took the place of the
            grants under <title>the Voluntary Schools Act</title> 1897, and § 97 of <title>the act of 1870</title> as amended by <title>the Elementary Education
              Act</title> 1897.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Education Committees.</hi>—The constitution of education committees is dealt with by § 17. All councils having powers under
              <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title>, except those having concurrent powers as to higher education only,
            must establish education committees in accordance with schemes made by the councils and approved by <name type="institution">the Board of
              Education</name> (§ 17 [1])- A scheme may provide for more than one education committee under a single council, but before approving such a scheme
              <name type="institution">the board</name> must satisfy themselves that due regard is paid to the importance of the general co-ordination of all
            forms of education (§ 17 [6])- All matters relating to the exercise by a council of their powers under <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title>, except the power of raising a rate or borrowing money, stand referred to the
            education committee ; the council may also delegate to the education committee any of their powers other than financial powers as above (§ 17 [2]).
            Every scheme must provide <list>
              <item>(a) for the appointment of a majority of the committee by the council, the persons so appointed to be persons who are members of the council
                unless in the case of a county the council otherwise determine ;</item>
              <item>(b) for the appointment by the council, on the nomination or recommendation, where it appears desirable, of other bodies (including
                associations of voluntary schools) of persons of experience in education, and of persons acquainted with the needs of the various kinds of
                schools in the area of the council;</item>
              <item>(c) for the inclusion of women.</item>
              <item>Provision was also made (d) for the representation in the first instance of members of existing school boards (§ 17 [3]).</item>
            </list></p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Expenses.</hi>—All parliamentary grants are made payable to the L.E.A. instead of as previously to the managers (§ 18 [2]). The
            county council must charge a proportion of all capital expenditure and liabilities, including rent, on account of the provision or improvement of
            any public elementary school on the parish or parishes which in the opinion of the council are served by the school, such proportion to be not less
            than one-half or more than three-fourths as the council think fit (§ 18 [1] [c] [d]). The county council may also if they think fit charge on the
            parishes benefited any expenses incurred with respect to education other than elementary (§ 18 [1] [a]).</p>
          <p><hi rend="italic">Endowments.</hi>— <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act</title> introduced a new principle into the
            administration of endowments by directing that their income so far as necessarily applicable in any case for those purposes of a public elementary
            school for which the local authority are liable must be paid to that authority for the relief of the parochial rate (§ 13). As the result of
            technicalities of legal interpretation the section has been found to have in practice a narrower scope than had been generally anticipated.</p>
          <p><title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">The act of 1902</title> was extended to London by a separate act in 1903, containing

          <p>The hostility of Nonconformists to the extension of rate-aid to denominational schools led to the organization upon a considerable scale of what
            became known as the <q>" Passive Resistance "</q> movement, a number of Nonconformist rate-payers refusing to pay the education rate on the ground
            that their consciences forbade their supporting the religious teaching in denominational schools; and their willingness to become subject to
            distraint and consequent inconveniences rather than pay the rates became the foundation of a widespread political campaign. In Wales, where in the
            rural districts the schools were commonly Anglican whilst the population was Nonconformist, particular difficulties arose in administering <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act</title> in consequence of the hostile attitude of the county authorities. Friction
            likewise manifested itself in one or two English areas, which reflected militant Nonconformist views. Accordingly the government passed <title>the
              Local Education (Local Authority Default) Act 1904</title>, empowering <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, in the case of
            default by the local authority, to make payments direct to the managers of the school and to deduct the amount from the sums payable to the

            administration introduced a bill to amend <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the Education Acts 1902-1903</title>, with the
            object of securing full public control of all rate-aided schools and the appointment of teachers without reference to religious belief. The bill was
            of a highly complex character; its principal features were,—compulsory transfer of existing voluntary schools to the local authority, facilities for
            the giving of denominational instruction in transferred schools out of school hours by persons other than the regular teachers, and the recognition
            in populous districts, upon the demand of parents, of special publicly maintained schools in which denominational teaching could be included in the
            curriculum ; the latter schools might (according to the bill as finally amended) in the last resort, i.e. if the local authority refused to maintain
            them, be recognized as state-aided schools. The bill encountered strong opposition from Anglicans and Catholics (though the Catholic Irish members
            finally voted for it as amended); it passed <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name>

            successor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_McKenna">Mr McKenna</name> introduced a bill based on what was known as <q>"
              contracting out."</q> In single-school parishes the existing schools were to be compulsorily transferred, subject to the grant of denominational
            facilities out of school hours; elsewhere a sufficiency of places in schools with <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> teaching, which the bill proposed to make
            compulsory in all provided schools, must be supplied by the local authority, while existing voluntary schools might become state-aided schools upon
            terms of receiving a grant of 47s. per head. The bill was accompanied by a financial scheme for a new system of allocating the parliamentary grant.
            In view of the improbability of its passing into law the bill was <pb n="981"/> not pressed beyond the stage of second reading. Meanwhile, when
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/H._H._Asquith">Mr Asquith</name> reorganized the cabinet, <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name> succeeded <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_McKenna">Mr McKenna</name> at the education office, and in the autumn he introduced a fresh measure

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walter_Runciman,_1st_Viscount_Runciman_of_Doxford">Mr Runciman</name>'s bill, like his predecessor's, was based
            upon the principle of compulsory transfer in single-school parishes and contracting out elsewhere, but it gave a right of entry for denominational
            teaching on two days a week during school hours in all council schools whether transferred voluntary schools or otherwise, with liberty to employ
            for this purpose assistant teachers, but not (save temporarily at first in transferred schools) head teachers. Provision was also made for the
            payment of a small rent which would be applicable for or towards the cost of the denominational instruction. Unfortunately, the compromise failed at
            the last moment for want of agreement as to the financial terms cf <q>" contracting out,"</q> the government offering 50s. per head and <name
              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_of_England">the Church</name> demanding 7s. more. It is obvious that <q>" contracting
              out "</q> is open to serious objection upon educational and economic grounds, and that if resorted to upon any very considerable scale it would
            involve a disruption of the public elementary system, and a duplication of schools which would constitute a wasteful drain upon the national
            exchequer. Upon such a system, therefore, some check is necessary, and, once decided that the check should take the form of financial pressure,
            rather than request of parents as in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_Birrell">Mr Birrell</name>'s bill, or some form
            of administrative control, the question of pecuniary terms became one of principle and not merely of financial detail. Moreover, the difficulty of
            adjusting differences was intensified by the opposition of the extremists on either side, which daily gathered force, and the bill was withdrawn by
            the government when in committee of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">the House of Commons</name>. The

            existence of a considerable body of influential opinion among all schools of thought in favour of a national compromise, and the proposals embodied

              the same time expressed some misgiving as to the effect of <quote>" so large a relaxation of the conditions by which it had hitherto been sought

            said to have largely removed such dangers as were to be apprehended from the relaxation in question. Thus it was possible for <name
              type="institution">the Board of Education</name> in the code of 1904 to abolish the last traces of the system of payment by results, by setting
            forth (in the language of their report for 1903-1904) <quote>" a properly co-ordinated curriculum suitable to the needs of the children, with an
              indication of the relation which the various subjects of instruction should bear to each other, in place of the relatively haphazard list of
              possible branches of knowledge which were formerly presented to the choice of individual schools or authorities."</quote> In the new code also the
            board for the first time endeavoured to state for the guidance of teachers and parents the proper aim of the public elementary school, laying stress
            upon that element of the training of character which the system of payment by results had so unfortunately obscured. The new spirit was strikingly
            manifested in the volume of <title><hi rend="italic">Suggestions for the Considerations of Teachers</hi></title>, issued by <name type="institution"
              >the Board of Education</name> in 1905. This volume represented a notable attempt to connect administration with educational theory, without in
            any way seeking to crush individual initiative, or to impose a bureaucratic uniformity of method upon those engaged in the actual work of the
            schools. Apprehension of the true aim of elementary education as essentially and primarily a preparation for practical life has led to a
            corresponding development of instruction of a practical character, observation lessons and nature study being treated as a necessary element in the
            curriculum, while handicraft and gardening, and domestic subjects (for girls), are encouraged by special grants. Particular attention has been
            bestowed both by the central and local authorities upon the problem of rural instruction, and much has been done in many areas to bring the schools
            into closer relations with the needs of agricultural and rural life generally. In this way the old and perhaps not altogether ill-founded distrust
            of popular education as tending to unfit the working classes for industrial pursuits is being broken down and a public opinion more favourable to

            and of public interest, as indicated by the clause in <title>the Act of 1899</title> providing for a public registration of qualified teachers and
            for the gradual elimination from the profession of those who were unqualified. And meanwhile the increased solidarity of <name type="institution"

          <p>The question of the preliminary education of elementary teachers had after some years of discussion reached a critical stage in 1909. The history
            of pupil teachership as a method of concurrent instruction and employment shows that it was in its inception something in the nature of a makeshift;
            the ideal placed before local education authorities in the recent regulations and reports of <ref><name type="institution">the Board of
                Education</name> is the alternative system whereby with the aid of national bursaries (instituted in 1907) <quote>" the general education of
                future teachers may be continued in secondary schools until the age of seventeen or eighteen, and all attempts to obtain a practical experience
                of elementary school work may be deferred until the training college is entered, or at least until an examination making a natural break in that
                general education and qualifying for an admission to a training college has been passed."</quote></ref> Under the revised pupil-teacher system
            established by the regulations of 1903 provision is made for the instruction of pupil teachers in centres which as far as possible are attached to
            secondary schools receiving grants from <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> under the regulations for secondary schools, about
            two-thirds of the secondary schools on the grant list undertaking this work. Accordingly, the result of recent changes is to modify the old system
            in two ways: first by providing the alternative of a full course of secondary education, secondly by associating pupil teachership itself as far as
            possible with part-time attendance at a secondary school. The total number of pupil teachers recognized during the year 1907-1908 was 20,571, and of
            these 9770 were in centres forming integral parts of secondary schools. The number of bursars who passed the leaving examination was 1486.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Training colleges.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>One of the principal difficulties which confronted the state and the local authorities in their task of organizing an improved system of public
            education under <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title> lay in the deficiency of training colleges in
            view of the increased number of teachers. Local authorities naturally hesitated to burden themselves with the cost of providing such institutions in
            view of the fact that there is nothing to prevent teachers trained at great expense by one authority taking service under a less public-spirited
            authority who had contributed nothing to such training ; hence a widespread feeling that the provision of training colleges should be undertaken by
            the state as a matter of national concern. Under these circumstances a new system of building grants in aid of the establishment of training
            colleges was instituted in 1905. In 1906 these grants were raised from 25 to 75 % of the capital expenditure, but were limited to colleges provided
            by local authorities. A further difficulty in view of the municipalization of education arose from the fact that the majority of the residential
            colleges were in the hands of denominational trusts which did not admit a conscience clause. Under the presidency of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reginald_McKenna">Mr McKenna</name> in 1907, <ref><name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>, in
              regulations which excited much controversy, <quote>" with a view to throwing open as far as possible the advantages of a course of training in
                colleges supported mainly by public funds to all students who are qualified to profit by it irrespective of religious creed or social
                status,"</quote></ref> laid down that the application of a candidate might in no circumstances be rejected on any religious ground, nor on the
            ground of social antecedents or the like. The same regulations provided that no new training colleges would be recognized except on terms of
            compliance with certain conditions as to freedom from denominational restrictions or requirements. The obligation as to religious exemptions has
            since been limited to 50 % of the admissions. There were in attendance <ref><bibl>(<title><hi rend="italic">Statistics</hi></title>, England,

          <p>The fear has been widely entertained that a considerable part of the national expenditure upon elementary education is wasted for want of an
            effective system of continuative instruction to be given out of working hours to adolescents engaged in industrial employment. The whole subject was
            exhaustively <pb n="983"/> treated by the report in 1909 of <name type="institution">the Consultative Committee</name> of <name type="institution"
              >the Board of Education</name>. This report seeks to base an efficient continuative system upon the improvement of elementary education by
            reducing the size of the classes in the elementary schools upon the lines now laid down by the new staffing regulations of 1909; by increasing the
            amount of instruction in hand-work with a view to rendering the curriculum less bookish and more efficient as a training for industrial and
            agricultural life; and by legislation to reform the system of half-time attendance and raise the age of compulsory attendance to thirteen and
            ultimately fourteen. Upon the foundation of an improved and prolonged elementary education there would be reared a superstructure of continuative
            schools or classes, attendance at which up to seventeen would be compulsory under bye-laws adoptive locally at the option of the local education
            authorities. In 1906-1907 about 21 per thousand of the population of England and Wales attended evening schools and classes inspected by <name

          <p>The most marked progress has undoubtedly been in secondary education, and in no direction has <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education_Act_1902">the act of 1902</title> proved more fruitful. At the end of the 19th century secondary
            instruction in England was still provided chiefly by endowed grammar-schools, by proprietary schools established by religious bodies or joint-stock
            companies, and by private enterprise. No public provision was made for secondary education as such; what financial assistance was forthcoming from
            municipal sources was given indirectly under cover of the grants under <title>the Technical Instruction Acts</title>, while in the administration of
            central grants for the first years of the working of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name><title>Act 1899</title>, no absolute
            differentiation between secondary and technological functions was recognized. The establishment of local authorities with direct duties in respect
            of secondary education, and the reorganization of the central office with reference to the three branches of education, elementary, secondary and
            technological, rendered possible for the first time an adequate treatment of the problem of public secondary education as a whole. <ref><quote>" The
                regulations for secondary schools," says the prefatory memorandum to the regulations of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name>,
                " grew up round the old provisions of the Directory of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Science_and_Art_Department">the
                  Science and Art Department</name>. Detached science classes were gradually built up into schools of science. Schools of science were
                subsequently widened into schools of what was known as the <q>' Division A '</q> type, providing a course of instruction in science in connexion
                with, and as part of, a course of general education. Aid was afterwards extended to schools of the <q>' Division B '</q> type in which science
                did not form the preponderating element of the instruction given. In 1904 <name type="institution">the board</name> recast the regulations so as
                to bring all schools aided by grants within the general definition of a school offering a general education up to and beyond the age of sixteen
                through a complete graded course of instruction, the object of which should be to develop all the faculties,and to form the habitof exercising
                them."</quote></ref></p>
          <p>Two main tendencies distinguish the recent development: on the one hand the tendency to municipalization, or at least to the establishment of
            public control; on the other hand the tendency (marked especially by the regulations of 1907) to greater elasticity in regard to curricula, and so
            to the freer encouragement of local initiative and local effort.</p>
          <p>In 1907 the government of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Campbell-Bannerman">Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman</name> placed
            greatly increased funds at the disposal of <name type="institution">the Board of Education</name> for the purpose of secondary education. The
            regulations under which the increased grant was administered imposed conditions in respect of freedom from denominational restrictions or
            requirements, representative local control, and accessibility to all classes of the people, which, like the analogous rules with regard to training
            colleges, roused considerable controversy. With regard to religious instruction, the requirement was made that no catechism or formulary distinctive
            of any particular religious denomination might be taught in the school except upon the request in writing of the parent or guardian and at the cost
            of funds other than grants of public money. Power was at the same time reserved to <name type="institution">the board</name> to waive the new
            conditions in the event of the local education authority passing a resolution that the school was in their view required as part of the secondary
            school provision for their area, and that the conditions, or one or more of them, might be waived with advantage in view of the educational needs of
            the area. It will be noticed that one effect of the regulations (as of the training college regulations) was to recognize as a kind of established
            religion those elements of Christianity which are shared in common by the various Protestant churches, according to the system of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Lancaster">Lancaster</name> and the <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Cowper-Temple,_1st_Baron_Mount_Temple">Cowper-Temple</name> compromise. Normally schools are required to
            provide 25 % of free places for scholars from public elementary schools, and, with a view to encouraging the transference of children from the
            public elementary school at an early age, a grant of £2 was made payable on account of ex-public elementary scholars between ten and twelve years of
            age. The full scale of grants is £2 for ex-public elementary scholars between ten and twelve, and £5 for scholars between twelve and eighteen. To
            schools previously recognized and failing to comply with the new conditions, grant may be paid on the lower scale of £2 and £2, 10s.
            respectively.</p>
          <p>Secondary school grants are assessed upon average attendance, and efficiency is guaranteed by inspection and not by individual examination. All
            recognized schools must provide at least the substantial equivalent of the four-years' course formerly required, and recognition is withheld or
            withdrawn if an adequate number of the scholars do not remain at least four years in the school, or do not remain up to sixteen ; in rural areas,
            however, and small towns, a school life of three years and a leaving age of fifteen may be accepted. <ref><quote>" The board are now in a position,

          <p>Notwithstanding the important differences which exist between the social and especially the religious conditions of England and Wales respectively,
            Wales continued to be treated as one with England for purposes of educational administrationdown to quite recent years. Towards the end of the 19th
            century the striking revival of Welsh nationality, in itself largely an educational and a literary movement, led to a spontaneous demand among the
            Welsh people for the organization of a national system of higher education. In accordance with the recommendations of a special royal commission
              <title>the Welsh Intermediate Education Act</title> passed in 1889 provided for the creation in every county in Wales (including <name

            examination. The joint education committees have now (except for the purpose of framing schemes for endowments) been superseded by the local

          <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi>—The first white settlers who came to North America were typical representatives of those European peoples who had
            made more progress in civilization than any other in the world. Those settlers, in particular those from England and from Holland, brought with them
            the most advanced ideas of the time on the subject of education. The conditions of life in the New World emphasized the need of schools and
            colleges, and among the earliest public acts of the settlers were provisions to establish them. The steps taken between 1619 and 1622 to provide
            schools for the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virginia">Virginia</name> were frustrated by the Indian war which
            broke out in the latter year, and were never successfully renewed during the colonial period. In <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name>, where the influence of <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">the Dutch</name> was at, first predominant, elementary schools were maintained at the public
            expense, and were intended for the education of all classes of the population. This policy reflected the very advanced views as to public elementary
            education which were then held in the Netherlands. The assumption of control in the colony of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people">the
              English</name> was a distinct check to the development of public elementary education, and little or no further progress was made until after the
            Revolution. The most systematic educational policy was pursued in the colony of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts"
              >Massachusetts</name>. As early as 1635, five years after it was founded, the town of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston"
              >Boston</name> took action to the end that <quote>" our brother <name type="person">Philemon Pormort</name> shall be entreated to become
              schoolmaster for the teaching and nurturing children with us."</quote><name type="institution">The General Court</name> of the colony in 1636 made
            the first appropriation for what was to become <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_College">Harvard College</name>,
            taking its name in honour of the minister, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Harvard_(clergyman)">John Harvard</name>, who
            died in 1638, leaving his library and one-half of his property, having a value of £800, to the new institution. The amount of this appropriation of
            1636 (£400) was remarkable in that it was probably equal to the whole colony tax for a year. In 1642 followed a legislative act which, while saying
            nothing of schools, gave to the selectmen in every town power to oversee both the education and the employment of children. It is made the duty of
            the selectmen to see that the children can read and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of the country, and that they are put
            to some useful work.</p>
          <p>Five years later, in 1647, was enacted the law which is not only the real foundation of the <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> school system, but the type of later legislation throughout the United
            States. This epoch-making act, the first of its kind in the world, represented the public opinion of a colony of about 20,000 persons, living in
            thirty towns. It required every town of fifty householders to establish a school, the master of which should be paid either by the parents of the
            children taught or by public tax, as the majority of the town committee might decide ; and it further required every town of one hundred families or
            householders to set up a grammar school in which pupils might be prepared for the <q>" University,"</q> as the new institution at <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambridge,_Massachusetts">Cambridge</name> was designated. Moreover, a penalty was attached to neglect of this
            legislative requirement, in the form of a fine to be devoted to the maintenance of the nearest school. <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace_Mann">Horace Mann</name> said of the act of 1647 : <quote>" It is impossible for us adequately to
                conceive the boldness of the measure, which aimed at universal education through the establishment of free schools. As a fact, it had no
                precedent in the world's history ; and, as a theory, it could have been refuted and silenced by a more formidable array of argument and
                experience than was ever marshalled against any other institution of human origin. But time has ratified its soundness. Two centuries of
                successful operation now proclaim it to be as wise as it was courageous, and as beneficent as it was disinterested."</quote></ref> The
            significance of these acts of 1642 and 1647 is that they foreshadow the whole American system of education, including elementary schools, secondary
            schools and colleges, and that they indicate the principles upon which that system rests. These principles as summarized by <ref><bibl><name

              System</hi></title></bibl></ref> are the following:— <list>
              <item>(1) The universal education of youth is essential to the well-being of the state.</item>
              <item>(2) The obligation to furnish this education rests primarily upon the parent.</item>
              <item>(3) The state has a right to enforce this obligation.</item>
              <item>(4) The state may fix a standard which shall determine the kind of education and the minimum amount.</item>
              <item>(5) Public money raised by general tax may be used to provide such education as the state requires. The tax may be general, though the
                school attendance is not.</item>
              <item>(6) Education higher than the rudiments may be supplied by the state.</item>
            </list> Opportunity must be provided at the public expense for youths who wish to be fitted for college. These principles have now found expression
            in the public acts of every state, and upon them education in the United States is founded.</p>

              >New Hampshire</name> (1770). In the colleges the ecclesiastical spirit was at first almost uniformly dominant. The greater number of their
            students were preparing for the ministry in some one of the branches of the Protestant Church. These facts caused the grammar schools to take on
            more and more the character of college-preparatory schools; and when this was brought about they supplied the educational needs of but one portion
            of the community. As time passed, the interdependence of governmental <pb n="985"/> and ecclesiastical interests began to weaken in the colonies,
            and there arose among those who represented the new secularizing tendency a distrust of the colleges and their influence. This gave rise to a new
            and influential type of school, the academy, which took its name from the secondary schools established in England by the dissenting religious
            bodies during the latter part of the seventeenth century at the suggestion of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Milton"
              >Milton</name>. These academies were intended to give an education which was thought to be more practical than that offered by the colleges, and
            they drew their students from the so-called middle classes of society. The older academies were usually endowed institutions, organized under the
            control of religious organizations or of self-perpetuating boards of trustees. Their programme of studies was less restricted than that of the
            grammar schools, and they gave new emphasis to the study of the English language and its literature, of mathematics and of the new sciences of
            nature. For two generations the academies were a most beneficent factor in American education, and they supplied a large number of the
            better-prepared teachers for work in other schools. These schools were in a sense public in that they were chartered, but they were not directly
            under public control in their management. Early in the 19th century there arose a well-defined demand for public secondary schools—high schools, as
            they are popularly known. They were the direct outgrowth of the elementary school system. <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</name>,
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baltimore">Baltimore</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> were the first of the large cities to establish schools of this type, and they
            spread rapidly. These public secondary schools met with opposition, however, springing partly from the friends of the academies, and partly from
            those who held that governmental agency should be restricted to the field of elementary education. The legal questions raised were settled by a
            decision of the supreme court of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michigan">Michigan</name>, which contained these words:
              <quote>" Neither in our state policy, in our constitution, nor in our laws do we find the primary school districts restricted in the branches of
              knowledge which their officers may cause to be taught, or the grade of instruction that may be given, if their voters consent, in regular form, to
              bear the expense and raise the taxes for the purpose."</quote> This decision gave marked impetus to the development of public secondary or high
            schools, and they have increased rapidly in number. The academies have relatively declined, and in the Western states are almost unknown.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the elementary school system had grown rapidly. The school district, the smallest civil division, was created in <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut">Connecticut</name> in 1701, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhode_Island"
              >Rhode Island</name> about 1750, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> in 1789. From the
            point of view of efficient, wellsupported schools, it has been felt since the time of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace_Mann">Horace Mann</name> that the substitution of the small school district for the town as the unit of
            school administration was a mistake. Yet the school district has exercised a profound influence for good upon the American people. In <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York state</name>, for example there were in 1900 over eleven thousand school
            districts, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illinois">Illinois</name> over twelve thousand. The districts are small in
            extent and often sparsely settled. Their government is as democratic as possible. The resident legal voters, often including women, hold a meeting
            at least once a year. They elect trustees to represent them in the employment of the teacher and the management of the school. They determine
            whether a new schoolhouse shall be built, whether repairs shall be made, and what sum of money shall be raised for school purposes. In the rural
            districts this system has often been itself a school in patriotism and in the conduct of public affairs. Recently the tendency is to merge the
            school districts into the township, in order that larger and better schools may be maintained, and that educational advantages may be distributed
            more evenly among the people. Most of the southern states have the county system of school administration. This is because the county, rather than
            the township, has been the political unit in the south from the beginning. Special laws have been made for the school system in cities, and the form
            of these laws differs very much. In nearly every city there is a separate board of education, sometimes chosen by the voters, sometimes appointed by
            the mayor or other official, which board has full control of the schools. The city board of education has as its executive officer a superintendent
            of schools, who has become a most important factor in American educational administration. He exerts great influence in the selection of teachers,
            in the choice of text-books, in the arrangement of the programme of studies, and in the determination of questions of policy. Sometimes he is
            charged by law with the initiative in some or all of these matters. He is usually a trained administrator as well as an experienced teacher. The
            first superintendent was appointed in 1837 at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buffalo,_New_York">Buffalo</name>. <name

            said that the progress of public education in the United States is marked by <list>
              <item>(1) compulsory schools,</item>
              <item>(2) compulsory licensing of teachers,</item>

              <item>and (4) compulsory school supervision,</item>
            </list> and by the increasingly efficient administration of these provisions. The compulsion comes in each case from the state government, which
            alone, in the American system, has the power to prescribe it and to enforce it. Each state is therefore an independent educational unit, and there
            is no single, uniform American system of education in any legal sense. In fact, however, the great mass of <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_of_the_United_States">the American people</name> are in entire agreement as to the principles which should
            control public education; and the points in which the policies of the several states are in agreement are greater, both in number and in importance,
            than those in which they differ. An American educational system exists, therefore, in spirit and in substance, even though not in form.</p>

            founders of the nation were by no means indifferent to education, but they shared the common view of their time, which was that the real
            responsibility for the maintenance of schools and the expense of maintaining them should fall upon the several local communities. The relation of
            government to education was not then a subject of ordinary consideration or discussion. Later, when this question did arise and the power of
            taxation was involved, the several states assumed control of education, as it was necessary that they should do. Nevertheless, from the very
            beginning the national government has aided and supported education, while not controlling it. This policy dates from the 13th of July 1787, when

              encouraged."</quote></ref><title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northwest_Ordinance">The Ordinance of 1787</title> also reaffirmed the
            provisions of the so-called <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Land_Ordinance_of_1785">Land Ordinance of 1785</title>, by which section No. 16
            in every township (a township consists of 36 numbered sections of 1 sq. m. each), or one thirty-sixth of the entire north-west territory, was set
            aside for the maintenance of public schools within the township. The funds derived from the sale and lease of these original <q>" school lands "</q>
            form the major portion of the public school endowment of the states formed out of the north-west territory. The precedent thus established became
            the policy of the nation. Each state admitted prior to 1848 reserved section No. 16 in every township of public land for common schools. Each state
            admitted since 1848 (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Utah">Utah</name> being an exception, and having four sections) has
            reserved sections No. 16 and No. 36 in every township of public lands for this purpose. In addition, the national government has granted two
            townships in every state and territory containing public lands for seminaries or universities. A third land grant is that made in 1862 for colleges
            of agriculture and the mechanical arts. The sum total of these three land grants amounted in <pb n="986"/> 1900 to 78,659,439 acres, to which there
            must be added various special grants made from time to time to the states and devoted to education. The portion of the public domain so set apart in
            1900 amounted in all to 86,138,473 acres, or 134,591 English sq. m. This is an area greater than those of the six <name type="place"

            and the kingdom of Holland. Besides the enormous grants of land in aid of education, the national government has maintained since 1802 a <name

            each of the agricultural colleges themselves. The aggregate value of land and money given by the national government for education in the several

          <p>In the United States the sovereign powers are not all lodged in one place. Such of those powers as are not granted by <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Constitution">the Constitution</title> to the national government are reserved to the states
            respectively, or to the people. The power to levy taxes for the support of public education has been almost universally held to be one of the powers
            so reserved. The inhabitants of the several local communities, however indisposed they may have been to relinquish absolute control of their own
            schools, have been compelled to yield to the authority of the state government whenever it has been asserted, for except under such authority no
            civil division—county, city, township, or school district—possesses the power to levy taxes for school purposes. Moreover, since the exercise of
            state authority has uniformly improved the quality of the schools, it has usually been welcomed, not resisted. In general, it may be said that the
            state has used its authority to prescribe a minimum of efficiency which schools and teachers must reach, and it enforces this minimum through
            inspection and the withholding of its proper share of the state school fund from any locality where schools or teachers are permitted to fall below
            the required standard. In extreme cases the state authorities have interfered directly to prevent the evil results of local inefficiency or
            contumacy. In addition, the states, almost without exception, maintain at their own expense schools for the training of teachers, known as normal
            schools. Many of the states also offer inducements to the cities, towns and districts to exceed the prescribed minimum of efficiency. Through the
            steady exercise of state supervision the school buildings have improved, the standard for entrance upon the work of teaching has been raised, the
            programme of studies has been made more effective and more uniform, and the length of the school term has increased. The Constitution of every state
            now contains some provision as to public education. Each state has an executive officer charged with the enforcement of the state school laws.
            Sometimes, ab in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York">New York</name>, this official has plenary powers ; sometimes, as in
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ohio">Ohio</name>, he is little more than an adviser. In twenty-nine states this official is known as the
            superintendent of public instruction ; in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Massachusetts">Massachusetts</name> and <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Connecticut">Connecticut</name> he is called secretary of the state board of education ; other
            titles used are commissioner of public schools, superintendent of common schools, and superintendent of public schools. The schools are
            administered, on behalf of the taxpayers, by an elected board of school trustees in rural school districts, and by an elected (though sometimes
            appointed) board of education or school committee in cities and towns. In 836 cities and towns there is a local superintendent of schools, who
            directs and supervises the educational work and acts as the executive officer of the board of education. The schools in the rural districts are
            under the direct supervision of a county superintendent of schools or similar official, who is often chosen by the people, but who sometimes is
            named by the state authorities. The county and city superintendents are often charged with the duty of holding examinations for entrance upon the
            work of teaching, and of issuing licences to those persons who pass the examinations. This system works best where it is carefully regulated by
            state law. Thirty states, one territory, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Washington,_D.C.">the District of Columbia</name>
            have enacted compulsory education laws, but the enforcement of them is usually very lax. In fifteen states and territories there are no compulsory
            education laws, although there are in existence there fully organized school systems free to all children. The usual age during which school
            attendance is required is from 8 to 14. Provision is made in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maine">Maine</name>, <name

          <p><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Susan_Blow">Miss Susan E. Blow</name>, herself the leading exponent of kindergarten principles
            in the United States, has pointed out that the history of the kindergnrten movement reveals four distinct <pb n="987"/> stages in its development:
            the pioneer stage, having <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston">Boston</name> as its centre; the philanthropic stage, which
            began in the village of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence,_Massachusetts">Florence, Mass.</name>, and reached its climax
            at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/San_Francisco">San Francisco, California</name>; the national or strictly educational stage,
            which began at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Louis,_Missouri">St Louis</name>; and the so-called maternal stage, which
            from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago">Chicago</name> as a centre is spreading over the entire country. During the first
            stage public attention was directed to a few of the most important aspects of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Fröbel"
              >Froebel</name>'s teaching. During the second stage the kindergarten was valued largely as a reformatory and redemptive influence. During the
            third stage the fundamental principles underlying kindergarten training were scientifically studied and expounded, and the kindergarten became part
            of the public school system of the country. The fourth stage, which, like the third, is fortunately still in existence, aims at making the
            kindergarten a link between the school and the home, and so to use it to strengthen the foundations and elevate the ideals of family life. By 1898
            there were 4363 kindergartens in the United States (1365 of which were public), employing 9937 teachers (2532 in the public kindergartens) and
            enrolling 189,604 children (95,867 in the public kindergartens). Of the 164 public normal schools, 36 made provision for training kindergarten
            teachers. The scientific and literary activity of some of the private kindergarten training classes is very great, and they exert a beneficial and
            stimulating effect on teaching in the elementary schools. It is generally admitted that from the point of view of the children, of the teachers, of
            the schools, and of the community at large, the kindergarten has been and is an inspiration of incalculable value.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Elementary schools</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The elementary school course is from six to nine years in length, the ordinary period being eight years. The pupils enter at about six years of
            age. In the cities the elementary schools are usually in session for five hours daily, except Saturday and Sunday, beginning at 9 A.M. There is an
            intermission, usually of an hour, at midday, and short recesses during the sessions. In the small rural schools the pupils are usually ungraded, and
            are taught singly or in varying groups. In the cities and towns there is a careful gradation of pupils, and promotions from grade to grade are made
            at intervals of a year or of a half-year. The best schools have the most elastic system of gradation and the most frequent promotions. In a number
            of states there are laws authorizing the conveyance of children to school at the public expense, when the schoolhouse is unduly distant from the
            homes of a portion of the school population. Co-education (q.v.) in the elementary school has been the salutary and almost uniform practice in the
            United States. The programme of studies in the elementary school includes English (reading, writing, spelling, grammar, composition), arithmetic
            (sometimes elementary algebra also, or plane geometry in the upper grades), geography, history of the United States, and elementary natural science,
            including human physiology and hygiene. Physical training, vocal music, drawing and manual training are often taught. Sometimes a foreign language
            (Latin, German or French) and the study of general history are begun. Formal instruction in manners and morals is not often found, but the
            discipline of the school offers the best possible training in the habits of truthfulness, honesty, obedience, regularity, punctuality and conformity
            to order. Religious teaching is not permitted, although the exercises of the day are often opened with reading from <title>the Bible</title>, the
            repetition of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord's_Prayer">the Lord's Prayer</title> and the singing of a hymn. Corporal punishment is not
            infrequent, but is forbidden by law in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_Jersey">New Jersey</name>, and in many states may be
            used only under restrictions. Text-books are used as the basis of the instruction given, and the pupils <q>" recite "</q> in class to the teacher,
            who, by use of illustration and comment, makes clear the subject-matter of the prescribed lesson. The purpose of the recitation method is to make
            the work of each pupil help that of his companion. Skilfully used, it is the most effectual instrument yet devised for elementary school
            instruction.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Secondary schools</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The secondary school course is normally four years in length. The principal subjects studied are Latin, Greek, French, German, algebra, geometry,
            physics, chemistry, physical geography, physiology, rhetoric, English literature, civics and history. Although but 11-36 % of the students in public
            high schools and 25-36 % of those in private secondary schools are preparing for a college or scientific school, yet the conditions prescribed by
            the colleges for admission to their courses affect powerfully both the secondary school programme and the methods of teaching. Of late years no
            educational topic has been more widely discussed than that as to the proper relations of secondary schools and colleges. As a result, special
            examinations for admission to college are either greatly simplified or entirely abolished, and the secondary studies are much more substantial and
            better taught than formerly. An increasing proportion of secondary school teachers are college graduates. The most extraordinary characteristic of
            secondary education in recent years is the rapid increase in the number of students taking Latin as a school subject. Meanwhile the proportion of
            those studying physics and chemistry has fallen off slightly. The rate of increase in the number of pupils who study Latin is fully twice as great
            as the rate of increase in the number of secondary school students. Between 1890 and 1896, while the number of students in private secondary schools
            increased 12 %, the number of students in public secondary schools increased 87 %. Since 1894 the number of students in private secondary schools
            has steadily declined.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The colleges.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The American college, although it is the outgrowth of the English colleges of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</name> and of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>, has developed into an institution which has no counterpart in Europe.
            The college course of study, at first three years in length, was soon extended to four years, and the classes are uniformly known as the freshman,
            the sophomore, the junior and the senior. The traditional degree which crowns the college course is that of Bachelor of Arts (A.B.). The studies
            ordinarily insisted on in the case of candidates for this degree are Latin, Greek, mathematics, English, philosophy, political economy, history, at
            least one modern European language (French or German), and at least one natural science. The degrees of Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of
            Philosophy (Ph.B.), and Bachelor of Letters (B.L.) are often conferred by colleges upon students who have pursued systematic courses of study which
            do not include Greek or the amount of Latin required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The best colleges give instruction which is similar in
            character to that given in Germany in the three upper classes of the gymnasium and in the introductory courses at the universities, in France in the
            two upper classes of the <foreign xml:lang="fr">lycée</foreign> and in the first two years of university study, and in England in the upper form of
            the public schools and during the years of undergraduate residence at <name type="institution"

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</name>. Since 1870 the colleges have developed enormously. Their resources
            have multiplied, the number of their students has increased by leaps and bounds, the programme of studies has broadened and deepened, the standards
            have been raised, and the efficiency of the instruction has greatly increased. Rigidly prescribed courses of study have given way to elective
            courses, and a knowledge of Greek is no longer required for the degree of A.B. at such influential colleges as <name type="institution"

              http://dbpedia.org/resource/Williams_College) or to the Roger Williams University (see http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Williams_University). –
              Alexey Gorobiy</note>. A strong effort is being made to have the leading colleges give but one degree, that of Bachelor of Arts, and to confer
            that upon those who complete any substantial course of college studies. A marked change has taken place in the attitude of the college authorities
            toward the students. In 1870 the college president was a paterfamilias. He knew each student and came into direct personal contact with him. The
            president and the faculty had supervision not only of the studies of the students, but of their moral and religious life as well. The older type of
            college professor was not always a great scholar, but he was a student of human nature, with keen intuitions and shrewd insight. The new type, which
            had come into existence at the opening of the 20th century, was more scholarly in some special direction, often regarded teaching as a check upon
            opportunities for investigation, and disdained troubling himself with a student's personal concerns or intellectual and moral difficulties. The
            change was not altogether <pb n="988"/> for the better, and a desirable reaction has been observable. Each college, however small or ill-equipped,
            exercises a helpful local influence. Ninety per cent of all college students attend an institution not more than one hundred miles from their own
            homes. Few colleges have a national constituency, and even in these cases an overwhelming preponderance of the students come from the immediate
            neighbourhood. This explains, in a measure, the powerful influence which the college has exercised in the life of the nation. While hardly more than
            one in a hundred of the white male youth of the country has had a college education, yet the college graduates have furnished one-half of all the
            presidents of the United States, most of the justices of <name type="institution"

            thirty-three ; from 1830 to 1865, one hundred and eighty ; from 1865 to 1898, two hundred and thirty-six. Their standards, efficiency and equipment
            are very diverse, many of the so-called colleges being less effective than some of the better organized secondary schools. Except in <name

            genuine university instruction much earlier, it may safely be said that the opening of the <name type="institution"

            of collegiate and university instruction under one corporation and one executive administration is distinctive of higher education in the United
            States, and its chief source of strength. The crowning honour of the university student is the degree of Ph.D., although that of A.M.—obtainable in
            less time and much easier conditions—is also sought. The minimum period of study accepted for the degree of Ph.D. is two years after obtaining the
            bachelor's degree; but in practice, three, and even four, years of study are found necessary. In addition to carrying on an investigation in the
            field of his main subject of study, the candidate for the degree of Ph.D. is usually required to pass examinations on one or two subordinate
            subjects, to possess a reading knowledge of French and German (often of Latin as well), and to submit—usually in printed form—the dissertation which
            embodies the results of his researches. The methods of instruction in the universities are the lecture, discussion and work in laboratory or
            seminary—the latter transplanted from the German universities. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon students who, after one year of
            university residence and study, pass certain prescribed examinations. This degree, like those of D.D., S.T.D. and L.L.D., is often conferred by
            colleges and universities as a purely honorary distinction. The degree of Ph.D. is not so conferred any longer by the best universities. Not a few
            of the universities maintain schools of law and medicine. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_University"
              >Harvard</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yale_University">Yale</name> universities maintain schools of
            theology as well. The learned publications issued by the universities, or under the direction of university professors, are of great importance, and
            constitute an imposing body of scientific literature. The national and state governments make increasing use of university officials for public
            service requiring special training or expert knowledge. In 1871-1872 there were only 198 resident graduate (or university) students in the United
            States. In 1887 this number had risen to 1237, and in 1897 to 4392. These figures are exclusive of professional students, and include only those who
            are studying in what would be called, in Germany, the philosophical faculty. (See also UNIVERSITIES.)</p>

            a more comprehensive view may be obtained here from the general statistics. The introduction to the statistical tables in vol. ii. of <title>the
              Commissioner of Education's Report for 1907</title> may usefully be quoted. <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Thorndike">Mr Edward L. Thorndike</name>, of <name type="institution"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teachers_College,_Columbia_University">the Teachers' College, Columbia University</name>, there summarizes the
              national account as follows :— <quote>"We use in formal school education a material plant valued at from twelve to thirteen hundred million
                dollars, the labour of 550,000 teachers or other educational officers, and more or less of the time of some eighteen million students ... We pay
                for the labour of those teachers, many of whom work for only part of the normal cityschool year, about $300,000,000. We pay for fuel, light,
                janitorial services, repairs, depreciation of books, school supplies, insurance and the like, about $90,000,000. For depreciation of the plant
                not so charged we should properly provide during the year a sinking fund of perhaps $25,000,000. Adding an interest charge of 5 % on the
                investment in the plant, our annual bill for formal school education comes to over $475.000,000. Additions to the plant were made [in 1906-1907]
                to the extent of from ninety to a hundred million dollars. As a partial estimate of the returns from this investment we may take the number of
                students whose education has been carried to a specified standard of accomplishment and power. Thus I estimate that, in 1907, 3000 students
                reached the standard denoted by three years or more of academic, technical or professional study in advance of a reputable college degree ; that
                25,000 students reached the standard denoted by at least three and not over four years of such study in advance of a four-year high-school
                course; that an eighth of a million students reached the standard denoted by at least three and not over four years of study in advance of an
                eight-year elementary-school course; and that three-quarters of a million students reached the standard of completion of an elementary school
                course of seven or eight years or its equivalent ... Roughly, nine-tenths of elementary education and the education of teachers, over two-thirds
                of secondary education, and over a third of college and higher technical education are provided and controlled by the public. Professional
                education, other than the training of teachers and engineers, is still largely a function of private provision and control. " The following
                rough comparison may serve to define further the status of education in the country at large. The plant used for formal education is valued at 1
                % of our entire national wealth, or twice the value of our telephone systems, or ten times the value of our Pullman and private cars, or
                one-tenth the value of our railroads. The number of teachers is approximately that of the clergymen, engineers, lawyers and physicians together,
                five times that of the regular army and navy, and about twice that of the saloon-keepers and bar-tenders and their assistants. The annual
                expenditure for education, exclusive of additions to the plant, is somewhat over twice the expenditure for the war and navy departments of the
                national government. It is three and a half times the expenditure of the national government in 1907 for pensions. It is about one and a fourth
                times the cost (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/New_York_City">New York</name> wholesale prices) of the sugar and coffee we
                consume annually."</quote></ref></p>
          <p>The above comparison indicates perhaps, not inadequately, the <q>" business "</q> conception of the value of education prevailing in the United
            States, where its practical advantages are realized as in no other country, not even Germany.</p>

          <p><gloss target="#HISTORY" rend="unmarked">The word " history " is used in two senses. It may mean either the record of events, or events
              themselves.</gloss> Originally (see below) limited to inquiry and statement, it was only in comparatively modern times that the meaning of the
            word was extended to include the phenomena which form or might form their subject. It was perhaps by a somewhat careless transference of ideas that
            this extension was brought about. Now indeed it is the commoner meaning. We speak of the <q>" history of England "</q> without reference to any
            literary narrative. We term kings and statesmen the <q>" makers of history,"</q> and sometimes say that the historian only records the history which
            they make. History in this connexion is obviously not the record, but the thing to be recorded. It is unfortunate that such a double meaning of the
            word should have grown up, for it is productive of not a little confusion of thought.</p>
          <p>History in the wider sense is all that has happened, not merely all the phenomena of human life, but those of the natural world as well. It
            includes everything that undergoes change ; and as modern science has shown that there is nothing absolutely static therefore the whole universe,
            and every part of it, has its history. The discovery of ether brought with it a reconstruction of our ideas of the physical universe, transferring
            the emphasis from the mathematical expression of static relationships to a dynamic conception of a universe in constant transformation ; matter in
            equipoise became energy in gradual readjustment. Solids are solids no longer. The universe is in motion in every particle of every part; rock and
            metal merely a transition stage between crystallization and dissolution. This idea of universal activity has in a sense made physics itself a branch
            of history. It is the same with the other sciences—especially the biological division, where the doctrine of evolution has induced an attitude of
            mind which is distinctly historical.</p>
          <p>But the tendency to look at things historically is not merely the attitude of men of science. Our outlook upon life differs in just this particular
            from that of preceding ages. We recognize the unstable nature of our whole social fabric, and are therefore more and more capable of transforming
            it. Our institutions are no longer held to be inevitable and immutable creations. We do not attempt to fit them to absolute formulae, but
            continually adapt them to a changing environment. Even modern architecture, notably in America, reflects the consciousness of change. The permanent
            character of ancient or medieval buildings was fitted only to a society dominated by static ideals. Now the architect builds, not for all time, but
            for a set of conditions which will inevitably cease in the not distant future. Thus our whole society not only bears the marks of its evolution, but
            shows its growing consciousness of the fact in the most evident of its arts. In literature, philosophy and political science, there is the same
            historical trend. Criticism no longer judges by absolute standards ; it applies the standards of the author's own environment. We no longer condemn
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Shakespeare">Shakespeare</name> for having violated the ancient dramatic laws, nor
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire">Voltaire</name> for having objected to the violations. Each age has its own
            expression, and in judging each we enter the field of history. In ethics, again, the revolt against absolute standards limits us to the relative,
            and morals are investigated on the basis of history, as largely conditioned by economic environment and the growth of intellectual freedom.
            Revelation no longer appeals to scientific minds as a source of knowledge. Experience on the other hand is history. As for political science, we do
            not regard the national state as that ultimate and final product which men once saw in <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">the Roman empire</name>. It has hardly come into being before forces are evident which aim at its
            destruction. Internationalism has gained ground in Europe in recent years ; and Socialism itself, which is based upon a distinct interpretation of
            history, is regarded by its followers as merely a stage in human progress, like those which have gone before it. It is evident that <ref><name
                type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Augustus_Freeman">Freeman</name>'s definition of history as <quote>" past politics
                "</quote></ref> is miserably inadequate. Political events are mere externals. History enters into every phase of activity, and the economic
            forces which urge society along are as much its subject as the political result.</p>
          <p>In short the historical spirit of the age has invaded every field. The world-picture presented in this encyclopaedia is that of a dynamic universe,
            of phenomena in process of ceaseless change. Owing to this insistent change all things which happen, or seem to happen, are history in the broader
            sense of the word. The encyclopaedia itself is a history of them in the stricter sense,— the description and record of this universal process. This
            narrower meaning is the subject of the rest of this article.</p>
          <p>The word <q>" history "</q> comes from the Gr. <foreign xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic">ίστορία</hi></foreign>, which was used by the Ionians in
            the 6th century B.C. for the search for knowledge in the widest sense. It meant inquiry, investigation, not narrative. It was not until two
            centuries later that the <foreign xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic">historikos</hi></foreign>, the reciter of stories, superseded the <foreign
              xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic">historeōn</hi></foreign><foreign xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic">(ίστορέων)</hi></foreign>, the seeker after
            knowledge. Thus history began as a branch of scientific research,—much the same as what the Athenians later termed philosophy. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> himself was as much a scientific explorer as a reciter of narrative, and his
            life-long investigation was <foreign xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic">historiē</hi></foreign> in his Ionian speech. Yet it was <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> himself who first hinted at the new use of the word, applied merely to the details
            accumulated during a long search for knowledge. It is not until <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>,
            however, that we have it definitely applied to the literary product instead of the inquiry which precedes it. From <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> to modern times, history (Lat. <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"
              >historia</hi></foreign>) has been a form of literature. It is only in the scientific environment of to-day that we recognize once more, with
            those earliest of the forerunners of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, that history involves two
            distinct operations, one of which, investigation, is in the field of science, while the other, the literary presentation, is in the field of
            art.</p>
          <p>The history of history itself is therefore two-fold. History as art flourishes with the arts. It calls upon the imagination and the literary gifts
            of expression. Its history does not run parallel with the scientific side, but rather varies in inverse ratio with scientific activity. Those
            periods which have been dominated by the great masters of style have been less interested in the criticism of the historian's methods of
            investigation than in the beauty of his rhetoric. The scientific historian, deeply interested <pb n="528"/> in the search for truth, is generally
            but a poor artist, and his uncoloured picture of the past will never rank in literature beside the splendid distortions which glow in the pages of a
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Michelet">Michelet</name> or <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Babington_Macaulay,_1st_Baron_Macaulay">Macaulay</name>. History the art, in so far as it is conditioned
            upon genius, has no single traceable line of development. Here the product of the age of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles">Pericles</name> remains unsurpassed still; the works of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides"
              >Thucydides</name> standing along with those of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phidias">Pheidias</name> as models for all
            time. On the other hand, history the science has developed so that it has not only gained recognition among historians as a distinct subject, but it
            has raised with it a group of auxiliary sciences which serve either as tools for investigation or as a basis for testing the results. The advance in
            this branch of history in the 19th century was one of its greatest achievements. The vast gulf which lies between the history of <name type="place"

            and that by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flinders_Petrie">Flinders Petrie</name> is the measure of its achievement. By the
            mechanism now at his disposal the scientific explorer can read more history from the dust-heaps of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abydos,_Egypt">Abydos</name> than the greatest traveller of antiquity could gather from the priests of <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sais,_Egypt">Saïs</name>. In tracing the history of history we must therefore keep in mind its
            double aspect.</p>
          <p>History itself, this double subject, the science and the art combined, begins with the dawn of memory and the invention of speech. It is wrong to
            term those ages <hi rend="italic">pre-historic</hi> whose history has not come down to us, including in one category the pre-literary age and the
            literary whose traces have been lost. Even the pre-literary had its history, first in myth and then in saga. The saga, or epos, was a great advance
            upon the myth, for in it the deeds of men replace or tend to replace the deeds of the gods. But we are still largely in the realm of imagination.
            Poetry, as <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thucydides">Thucydides</name> complained, is a most imperfect medium for fact. The
            bard will exaggerate or distort his story. True history, as a record of what really has happened, first reached maturity in prose. Therefore,
            although much of the past has been handed down to us in epic, in ballad and in the legends of folk-lore, we must turn from them to what became
            history in the narrower sense.</p>
          <p>The earliest prose origins of history are the inscriptions. Their inadequacy is evident from two standpoints. Their permanence depends not upon
            their importance, but upon the durability of the substance on which they are inscribed. A note for a wedding ring baked into the clay of <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name> has been preserved, while the history of the greatest events has perished.
            In the second place they are sealed to all but those who know how to read them, and so they lie forgotten for centuries while oral tradition
            flourishes,—being within the reach of every man. It is only recently that archaeology, turning from the field of art, has undertaken to interpret
            for us this first written history. The process by which the modern fits together all the obtainable remains of an antiquity, and reconstructs even
            that past which left no written record, lies outside the field of this article. But such enlargement of the field of history is a modern scientific
            product, and is to be distinguished from the imperfect beginnings of history-writing which the archaeologist is able to decipher.</p>
          <p>Next to the inscriptions,—sometimes identical with them,— are the early chronicles. These are of various kinds. Family chronicles preserved the
            memory of heroic ancestors whose deeds in the earliest age would have passed into the keeping of the bards. Such family archives were perhaps the
            main source for Roman historians. But they are not confined to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> or
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Greece">Greece</name>. Genealogies also pass from the bald verse, which was the
            vehicle for oral transmission, to such elaborate tables as those in which <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manetho"
              >Manetho</name> has preserved the dynasties of Egyptian Pharaohs.</p>
          <p>In this field the priest succeeds the poet. The temple itself became the chief repository of records. There were simple religious annals, votive
            tablets recording miracles accomplished at a shrine, lists of priests and priestesses, accounts of benefactions, of prodigies and portents. In some
            cases, as in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>, the pontiffs kept a kind of register, not merely of
            religious history, but of important political events as well. Down to the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gracchi">the
              Gracchi</name> (131 B.C.) the Pontifex Maximus inscribed the year's events upon annual tablets of wood which were preserved in <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Regia">the Regia</name>, the official residence of the pontiff in <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Forum">the Forum</name>. These pontifical <q>" annals "</q> thus came to be a sort of civic history.
            Chronicles of the Greek cities were commonly ascribed to mythical authors, as for instance that of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miletus">Miletus</name>, the oldest, to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cadmus"
              >Cadmus</name> the inventor of letters. But they were continued and edited by men in whom the critical spirit was awakening, as when the
            chroniclers of Ionian towns began the criticism of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer">Homer</name>.</p>
          <p>The first historians were the logographi of these Ionian cities ; men who carried their inquiry <foreign xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic"
                >(historiē)</hi></foreign> beyond both written record and oral tradition to a study of the world around them. Their <q>" saying "</q><foreign
              xml:lang="gr"><hi rend="italic">(logos)</hi></foreign> was gathered mostly from contemporaries; and upon the basis of a widened experience they
            became critics of their traditions. <ref>The opening lines of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus">Hecataeus

              laughable."</quote></ref> Those words mark an epoch in the history of thought. They are the introduction to historical criticism and scientific
            investigation. Whatever the actual achievement of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hecataeus_of_Miletus">Hecataeus</name> may
            have been, from his time onward the scientific movement was set going. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodorus">Herodorus of

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>, a professional story-teller, rose to the height of genuine scientific investigation.
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name>' inquiry was not simply that of an idle tourist. He was a
            critical observer, who tested his evidence. It is easy for the student now to show the inadequacy of his sources, and his failure here or there to
            discriminate between fact and fable. But given the imperfect medium for investigation and the absence of an archaeological basis for criticism, the
            work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> remains a scientific achievement, as remarkable for its
            approximation to truth as for the vastness of its scope. Yet it was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus"
            >Herodotus</name>' chief glory to have joined to this scientific spirit an artistic sense which enabled him to cast the material into the truest
            literary form. He gathered all his knowledge of the ancient world, not simply for itself, but to mass it around the story of the war between the
            east and west, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> and <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Persian_people">the Persians</name>. He is first and foremost a story-teller ; his theme is like that of the
            bards, a heroic event. His story is a vast prose epos, in which science is to this extent subordinated to art. <quote>" This is the showing forth of
              the Inquiry of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, to the end that neither the deeds of men may be forgotten by lapse of time, nor the works, great and

            constructed it in order to lift that narrative into the realm of pure literature. Speeches, letters and documents are reworded to be in tone with
            the rest of the story. It was his art, in fact, which really created the Peloponnesian war out of its separate parts. And yet this art was merely
            the language of a scientist. The <quote>" laborious task "</quote> of which he speaks is that of consulting all possible evidence, and weighing

            light of inscriptions, so closely does it keep to the sources. The style found no imitator; history passed from <name type="place"

            rhetoric was combined with an extensive study of the sources; but the influence of the Greek rhetoricians upon Roman prose was deplorable from the

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> that with the expansion of Hellenism the subject of historians expanded as well.
            Universal history was begun by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ephorus">Ephorus</name>, the rhetorician, and formed the theme

          <p>History-writing in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name>,—except for the Greek writers resident there,—was
            until the first half of the 1st century B.C. in the form of annals. Then came rhetorical ornamentation,—and the Ciceronian era. The first Roman

            as uncritical and inaccurate as he was brilliant. From <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livy">Livy</name> to <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tacitus">Tacitus</name> the gulf is greater than from <name type="person"

            from the brilliancy of his youth to the sternness and sombre gravity of age, passing almost to poetic expression in its epigrammatic terseness. Yet
            in spite of his searching study of authorities, his keen judgment of men, and his perception of underlying principles of moral law, his view was
            warped by the heat of faction, which glows beneath his external objectivity. After him Roman history-writing speedily degenerated.

          <p>The 4th and 5th centuries saw a great revolution in the history of history. The story of the pagan past slipped out of mind, and in its place was

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">the Jews</name>. Christianity from the first had forced thinking men to reconstruct their philosophy of

            point of view became dominant in historiography. Three centuries more passed before the pagan models were quite lost to sight. But from the 7th

            culture of arts and sciences, but outcasts who do not enter into the divine scheme of the world's history. When a line was drawn between pagan and
            Christian back to the creation of the world, it left outside the pale of inquiry nearly all antiquity. But it must be remembered that that antiquity
            was one in which the German nations had no personal interest. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scipio_(cognomen)">Scipio</name>

          <p>From the first, Christianity had a philosophy of history. Its earliest apologists sought to show how the world had followed a divine plan in its
            long preparation for the life of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus">Christ</name>. From this central fact of all history,
            mankind should continue through war and suffering until the divine plan was completed at the judgment day. The fate of nations is in God's hands;
            history is the revelation of His wisdom and power. Whether He intervenes directly by miracle, or merely sets His laws in operation, He is master of
            men's fate. This idea, which has underlain all Christian philosophy of history, from the first apologists who prophesied the fall of <name

          <p>The commonest form of medieval historical writing was the chronicle, which reaches all the way from monastic annals, mere notes on Easter tables,
            to the dignity of national monuments. Utterly lacking in perspective, and dominated by the idea of the miraculous, they are for the most part a
            record of the trivial or the marvellous. Individual historians sometimes recount the story of their own times with sober judgment, but seldom know
            how to test their sources when dealing with the past. Contradictions are often copied down without the writer noticing them ; and since <name
              type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> forged and falsified so many documents,— monasteries, towns and
            corporations gaining privileges or titles of possession by the bold use of them,—the narrative of medieval writers cannot be relied upon unless we
            can verify it by collateral evidence. Some historians, like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_of_Freising">Otto of
              Freising</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guibert_of_Nogent">Guibert of Nogent</name> or <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bernard_Gui">Bernard Gui</name>, would have been scientific if they had had our appliances for comparison. But
            even men like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name>, who deplored the inaccuracy of texts, had worked
            out no general method to apply in their restoration. Toward the close of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the
              middle ages</name> the vernacular literatures were adorned with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Filippo_Villani"
              >Villani</name>'s and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Froissart">Froissart</name>'s chronicles. But the merit of both
            lies in their journalistic qualities of contemporary narrative. Neither was a history in the truest sense.</p>
          <p><name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">The Renaissance</name> marked the first great gain in the historic sense, in the
            efforts of the humanists to realize the spirit of the antique world. They did not altogether succeed; antiquity to them meant largely <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cicero">Cicero</name>.
            Their interests were literary, and the un-Ciceronian centuries were generally ignored. Those in which the foundations of modern Europe were laid,
            which produced parliaments, cathedrals, cities, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dante_Alighieri">Dante</name> and <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Chaucer</name>, were grouped alike on one dismal level and christened <name
              type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. The perspective of the humanists was only one degree better
            than that of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. History became the servant to literature, an
            adjunct to the classics. Thus it passed into the schools, where text-books still in use devote 200 pages to the Peloponnesian war and two to <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">the Athens</name> of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericles"
              >Pericles</name>.</p>
          <p>But if the literary side of humanism has been a barrier to the progress of scientific history, the discovery and elucidation of texts first made
            that progress possible. Historical criticism soon awoke. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lorenzo_Valla">Laurentius
            Valla</name>'s brilliant attack on the <title>" Donation of Constantine "</title> (1440), and <name type="person"

              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV. – Alexey Gorobiy</note> from monkish tales mark the rise of the new science. One sees at a glance what an
            engine of controversy it was to be ; yet for a while it remained but a phase of humanism. It was north of the Alps that it parted company with the
            grammarians. Classical antiquity was an Italian past, the German scholars turned back to the sources of their national history. <name type="person"

            of the 15th century was not paralleled in France or England, where the classical humanities reigned. The Reformation meanwhile gave another turn to
            the work of German scholars.</p>
          <p>The Reformation, with its healed controversies, seems a strange starting-point for science, yet it, even more than <name type="period"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the Renaissance</name>, brought out scientific methods of historical investigation. It not only
            sobered the humanist tendency to sacrifice truth for aesthetic effect, it called for the documents of <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church">the Church</name> and subjected them to the most hostile criticism. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Luther">Luther</name> himself challenged them. Then in <bibl><title

              >Church</name> by a great collection of sources accompanied with much destructive criticism. This gigantic work is the first monument of modern
            historical research. The reply of <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caesar_Baronius">Cardinal

              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caesar_Baronius">Baronius</name>' criticism and texts are faulty, though far surpassing
            anything before his day, and his collection is the basis for most subsequent ones,—in spite of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger">J.J. Scaliger</name>'s refutation, which was to contain an equal number of volumes of the

          <p>The movement back to the sources in Germany until the Thirty Years' War was a notable one. Collections were made by <name type="person">Simon

            (1576-1635) and others. After the war <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gottfried_Leibniz">Leibnitz</name> began a new epoch,
            both by his philosophy with its law of continuity in phenomena, and by his systematic attempt to collect sources through an association (1670). His
            plan to have documents printed as they were, instead of <q>" correcting "</q> them, was a notable advance. But from <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gottfried_Leibniz">Leibnitz</name> until the 19th century German national historiography made little

            whose splendid collections of sources are still in use. <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Bodin">Jean

                  cognitionem</hi></title>, <date>1566</date>)</bibl>, but he did not apply his own principles of criticism ; and it was left for the
            Benedictine monks of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregation_of_St._Maur">the Congregation of St Maur</name> to
            establish definitely the new science. The place of this school in the history of history is absolutely without a parallel. Few of those in the
            audiences of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Molière">Molière</name>, returning home under the grey walls of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abbey_of_Saint-Germain-des-Prés">St Germain-des-Près</name>, knew that within that monastery the men whose
            midnight they disturbed were laying the basis for all scientific history ; and few of the later historians of that age have been any wiser. But when
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Luc_d'Achery">Luc d'Achery</name> turned from exegetics to patristics and the lives of the

            Here, as in the Reformation, controversy called out the richest product. <bibl><author><name type="person"

            prepared this manual for the testing of medieval documents. Its canons are the basis, indeed, almost the whole, of the science of diplomatic (q.v.),
            the touchstone of truth for medieval research. Henceforth even the mediocre scholar had a body of technical rules by which to sort out the vast mass
            of apocrypha in medieval <pb n="531"/> documentary sources. Scientific history depends upon implements. Without manuals, dictionaries, and easy
            access to texts, we should go as far astray as any medieval chronicler. The France of the Maurists supplied the most essential of these instruments.

            untrustworthy generalities passed for history in the salons of the old regime. Interrupted by the Revolution, it revived in the 19th century, and

            century was to reveal in England.</p>
          <p>In the 19th century the science of history underwent a sort of industrial revolution. The machinery of research, invented by the genius of men like
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean_Mabillon">Mabillon</name>, was perfected and set going in all the archives of Europe.
            Isolated workers or groups of workers grew into national or international associations, producing from archives vast collections of material to be
            worked up into the artistic form of history. The result of this movement has been to revolutionize the whole subject. These men of the factory—
            devoting their lives to the cataloguing of archives and libraries, to the publication of material, and then to the gigantic task of indexing what
            they have produced—have made it possible for the student in an American or Australian college to master in a few hours in his library sources of
            history which baffled the long years of research of a <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmond_Martène">Martène</name> or <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Rymer">Rymer</name>. The texts themselves have mostly become as correct as they can ever be,
            and manuals and bibliographies guide one to and through them, so that no one need go astray who takes the trouble to make use of the mechanism which
            is at his hand. For example, since the papal archives were opened, so many <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">regesta</hi></foreign> have
            appeared that soon it will be possible to follow the letter-writing of the medieval popes day by day for century after century.</p>
          <p>The apparatus for this research is too vast to be described here. Archives have been reformed, their contents catalogued or calendared ; government
            commissions have rescued numberless documents from oblivion or destruction, and learned societies have supplemented and criticized this work and
            co-ordinated the results. Every state in Europe now has published the main sources for its history. <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rolls_Series">The <q>" Rolls "</q> series</title>, <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monumenta_Germaniae_Historica"><hi rend="italic">the Monumenia Germaniae historica</hi></title>, and the
                <title><hi rend="italic">Documents inédits</hi></title> are but the more notable of such national products. A series of periodicals keeps watch
            over this enormous output. The files and indices of <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_English_Historical_Review"><hi rend="italic">the
                English Historical Review</hi></title>, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Historische_Zeitschrift"><hi rend="italic">Historische

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Historical_Review"><hi rend="italic">American Historical Review</hi></title> will alone reveal the
            strength and character of historical research in the later 19th century.</p>
          <p>Every science which deals with human phenomena is in a way an implement in this great factory system, in which the past is welded together again.
            Psychology has been drawn upon to interpret the movements of revolutions or religions, anthropology and ethnology furnish a clue to problems to
            which the key of documents has been lost. Genealogy, heraldry and chronology run parallel with the wider subject. But the real auxiliary sciences to
            history are those which deal with those traces of the past that still exist, the science of language (philology), of writing (palaeography), of
            documents (diplomatic), of seals (sphragistics), of coins (numismatics), of weights and measures, and archaeology in the widest sense of the word.
            These sciences underlie the whole development of scientific history. Dictionaries and manuals are the instruments of this industrial revolution.
            Without them the literary remains of the race would still be as useless as Egyptian inscriptions to the fellaheen. Archaeology itself remained but a
            minor branch of art until the machinery was perfected which enabled it to classify and interpret the remains of the <q>" pre-historic "</q> age.</p>
          <p>This is the most remarkable chapter in the whole history of history—the recovery of that past which had already been lost when our literary history
            began. The perspective stretches out as far the other side of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homer">Homer</name> as we are
            this. The old <q>" providential "</q> scheme of history disintegrates before a new interest in the <q>" gentile "</q> nations to whose high culture
            Hebrew sources bore unwilling testimony. Biblical criticism is a part of the historic process. The Jewish texts, once the infallible basis of
            history, are now tested by the libraries of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Babylon">Babylon</name>, from which they were partly
            drawn, and Hebrew history sinks into its proper place in the wide horizon of antiquity. The finding of the Rosetta stone left us no longer dependent
            upon Greek, Latin or Hebrew sources, and now fifty centuries of Egyptian history lie before us. The scientific historian of antiquity works on the
            hills of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crete">Crete</name>, rather than in the quiet of a library with the classics spread out
            before him. There he can reconstruct the splendour of that <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minoan_civilization">Minoan
              age</name> to which Homeric poems look back, as the Germanic epics looked back to <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ancient_Rome">Rome</name> or <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verona">Verona</name>. His
            discoveries, co-ordinated and arranged in vast <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">corpora inscriptionum</hi></foreign>, stand now alongside
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livy"
              >Livy</name>, furnishing a basis for their criticism. Medieval archaeology has, since <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jules_Etienne_Joseph_Quicherat">Quicherat</name>, revealed how men were living while the monks wrote chronicles,
            and now cathedrals and castles are studied as genuine historic documents.</p>
          <p>The immense increase in available sources, archaeological and literary, has remade historical criticism. <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leopold_von_Ranke">Ranke</name>'s application of the principles of <quote>" higher criticism "</quote> to works
              written since the invention of printing <title><hi rend="italic">(Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber)</hi></title></ref> was an epoch-making
            challenge of narrative sources. Now they are everywhere checked by contemporary evidence, and a clearer sense of what constitutes a primary source
            has discredited much of what had been currently accepted as true. This is true not only of ancient history, where last year's book may be a thousand
            years out of date, but of the whole field. Hardly an <q>"old master"</q> remains an authoritative book of reference. <name type="person"

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Guizot">Guizot</name> stand to-day by reason of other virtues than their truth. Old landmarks drop out
            of sight—e.g. the fall of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Roman_Empire">the Western Empire</name> in 476, the
            coming of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> to Italy in 1450, dates which once enclosed <name
              type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>. The perspective changes—<name type="period"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">the Renaissance</name> grows less and <name type="period"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle <pb n="532"/> ages</name>; the Protestant Revolution becomes a complex of economics and
            politics and religion; the French Revolution a vast social reform in which the Terror was an incident, etc., etc. The result has been a complete
            transformation of history since the middle of the 19th century.</p>
          <p>In the 17th century the Augustinian scheme of world history received its last classic statement in <bibl><author><name type="person"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques-Bénigne_Bossuet">Bossuet</name></author>'s <title><hi rend="italic">Histoire
              universelle</hi></title></bibl>. <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire">Voltaire</name></author>'s reply to
              it in the 18th <title><hi rend="italic">(Essai sur les moeurs)</hi></title></bibl> attacked its limitations on the basis of deism, and its
            miraculous procedure on that of science. But while there are foreshadowings of the evolutionary theory in this work, neither the <foreign
              xml:lang="fr"><hi rend="italic">philosophe</hi></foreign> historians nor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Hume"
              >Hume</name> nor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Gibbon">Gibbon</name> arrived at a constructive principle in history
            which could take the place of the Providence they rejected. Religion, though false, might be a real historic force. History became the tragic
            spectacle of a game of dupes—the real movers being priests, kings or warriors. The pawns slowly acquired reason, and then would be able to regulate
            the moves themselves. But all this failed to give a satisfactory explanation of the laws which determine the direction of this evolution. <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giambattista_Vico">Giovanni Battista Vico</name> (1668-1744) was the first to ask why there is no
            science of human history. But his lonely life and unrecognized labours leave him apart from the main movement, until his works were discovered again
            in the 19th century. It was <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_Hermann_Ludwig_Heeren">A.L.H. Heeren</name> who, at the
            opening of the 19th century, first laid that emphasis upon the economic factors in history which is to-day slowly replacing the Augustinian
            explanation of its evolution. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arnold_Hermann_Ludwig_Heeren">Heeren</name>'s own influence,
            however, was slight. The first half of the century (apart from the scientific activity of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Heinrich_Pertz">Pertz</name>, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/François_Guizot"
              >Guizot</name>, etc.) was largely dominated by the romanticists, with their exaggeration of the individual. <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Carlyle">Carlyle</name>'s <quote>" great man theory of history "</quote></ref> is logically connected
            with the age of Scott. It was a philosophy of history which lent itself to magnificent dramatic creations ; but it explained nothing. It substituted
            the work of the genius for the miraculous intervention of Providence, but, apart from certain abstract formulae such as Truth and Right, knew
            nothing of why or how. It is but dealing in words to say that the meaning of it all is God's revelation of Himself. Granting that, what is the
            process ? Why does it so slowly reveal the Right of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name> (as in
            slavery for instance) to be the Wrong to-day ? <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Carlyle">Carlyle</name> stands to <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques-Bénigne_Bossuet">Bossuet</name> as the sage to the myth. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Hegel</name> got no closer to realities. His idealistic scheme of history, which
            makes religion the keynote of progress, and describes the function of each—Judaism to typify duty, Confucianism order, Mahommedanism justice,
            Buddhism patience, and Christianity love—does not account for the facts of the history enacted by the devotees. It characterizes, not the real
            process of evolution, but an ideal which history has not realized. Besides, it does not face the question how far religion itself is a product or a
            cause, or both combined.</p>
          <p>In the middle of the century two men sought to incorporate in their philosophy the physical basis which <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Hegel</name> had ignored in his spiritism—recognizing that life is conditioned by
            an environment and not an abstraction for metaphysics. <bibl><author><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Thomas_Buckle">H.T.
                  Buckle</name></author>, in his <title><hi rend="italic">History of Civilization in England</hi></title><date>(1857)</date></bibl>, was the
            first to work out the influences of the material world upon history, developing through a wealth of illustration the importance of food, soil and
            the general aspect of nature upon the formation of society.</p>
          <p><ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Thomas_Buckle">Buckle</name> did not, as is generally believed, make these three
              factors dominate all history. He distinctly stated that <quote>" the advance of European civilization is characterized by a diminishing influence
                of physical laws and an increasing influence of mental laws,"</quote> and <quote>"the measure of civilization is the triumph of mind over
                external agents."</quote> Yet his challenge, not only to the theologian, but also to those <quote>" historians whose indolence of thought
                "</quote> or <quote>"natural incapacity "</quote></ref> prevented them from attempting more than the annalistic record of events, called out a
            storm of protest from almost every side. Now that the controversy has cleared away, we see that in spite of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Thomas_Buckle">Buckle</name>'s too confident formulation of his laws, his pioneer work in a great field
            marks him out as the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine</name> of the scientific age. Among
            historians, however, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Thomas_Buckle">Buckle</name>'s theory received but little favour for
            another generation. Meanwhile the economists had themselves taken up the problem, and it was from them that the historians of to-day have learned
            it. Ten years before <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_Thomas_Buckle">Buckle</name> published his history, <ref><name
                type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx</name> had already formulated the <quote>" economic theory of
                history."</quote></ref> Accepting with reservation <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach"

            that the causes of that process of growth which constitutes the history of society are to be found in the economic conditions of existence. From
            this he went on to socialism, which bases its militant philosophy upon this interpretation of history. But the truth or falseness of socialism does
            not affect the theory of history. In 1845 <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Marx</name> wrote of the
              Young-Hegelians that to separate history from natural science and industry was like separating the soul from the body, and <quote>" finding the

                philosophie</hi></title><date>(1847)</date></bibl> he lays down the principle that social relationships largely depend upon modes of production,
            and therefore the principles, ideas and categories which are thus evolved are no more eternal than the relations they express, but are historical
            and transitory products. In the famous <bibl><title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Communist_Manifesto"><hi rend="italic">Manifesto of the
                  Communist Parly</hi></title><date>(1848)</date></bibl> the theory was applied to show how the industrial revolution had replaced feudal with
            modern conditions. But it had little vogue, except among Socialists, until the third volume of <bibl><title

            its importance was borne in upon continental scholars. Since then the controversy has been almost as heated as in the days of the Reformation. It is
            an exaggeration of the theory which makes it an explanation of all human life, but the whole science of dynamic sociology rests upon the postulate

          <p>The content of history always reflects the interests of the age in which it is written. It was so in <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herodotus">Herodotus</name> and in medieval chronicles. Modern historians began with politics. But as the complex
            nature of society became more evident in the age of democracy, the economic or sociological history gained ground. Histories of commerce and cities
            now rank beside those on war and kings, although there are readers still who prefer to follow the pennants of robber barons rather than to watch the
            slow evolution of modern conditions. The drum-and-trumpet history has its place like that of art, jurisprudence, science or philosophy. Only now we
            know that no one of these is more than a single glimpse at a vast complex of phenomena, most of which lie for ever beyond our ken.</p>
          <p>This expansion of interest has intensified specialization. Historians no longer attempt to write world histories ; they form associations of
            specialists for the purpose. Each historian chooses his own epoch or century and his own subject, and spends his life mastering such traces of it as
            he can find. His work there enables him to judge of the methods of his fellows, but his own remains restricted by the very wealth of material which
            has been accumulated on the single subject before him. Thus the great enterprises of to-day are co-operative—the <title><hi rend="italic">Cambridge

        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The origin of science</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The beginnings of physical science are to be sought in the slow and unconscious observation by primitive races of men of natural occurrences, such
            as the apparent movements of the heavenly bodies, and in the gradually acquired mastery over the rude implements by the aid of which such men strove
            to increase the security and comfort of their lives. Biological science similarly must have begun with observation of the plants and animals useful
            to man, and with empirical medicine and surgery. It was only when a considerable progress had been made with ordered knowledge that men began to ask
            questions about the meaning and causes of the phenomena, and to discern the connexions between them.</p>
          <p>In the earliest stage of development it seems that an anthropomorphic or mythological explanation is always assigned to the phenomena of nature.
            With no clue to trace the regularity of sequence and connexion between those phenomena, an untutored mind inevitably refers the apparently
            capricious events which succeed each other to the direct and immediate intervention of some unseen being of a nature essentially similar to his own.
            The sun is the flaming chariot of the sun-god, driven day by day across the heavens; the clouds are cows from which milk descends as nourishing rain
            on the fruitful earth. We may regard such myths as childlike fancies, but they were doubtless an advance on the want of all explanation which
            preceded them; they supplied hypotheses which, besides giving rise to themes of beauty and suggestiveness for poetry and art, played the first and
            chief part of a scientific hypothesis in pointing the way for further inquiry. Much useful knowledge was acquired and much skill gained in logical
            analysis before these primitive explanations were proved insufficient. A false theory which can be compared with facts may be more useful at a given
            stage of development than a true one beyond the comprehension of the time, and incapable of examination by observation or experiment by any means
            then known. The Newtonian theory of gravitation might be useless to a savage, to whose mind the animistic view of nature brought conviction and
            helpful ideas, which he could test by experience.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Early astronomy</hi></hi></head>
          <p>The phenomena of the heavens are at once the most striking, the most easily observed and the most regular of those which <pb n="397"/> are
            impressed inevitably on the minds of thinking men. Thus it is to astronomy we must look for the first development of scientific ideas. The
            orientation of many prehistoric monuments shows that a certain amount of astronomical observation had been acquired at a very early age, and <name
              type="people">the Chaldeans</name> seem to have gone so far as to recognize a law of periodicity even in eclipses. From the land of Asia <name
              type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> took their earliest ideas of science, and it is to the Ionian
            philosophers, of whom <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thales">Thales of Miletus</name> (580 B.C.) is regarded as the first,
            that we must turn for the earliest known example of an advance on the mythological view of nature. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</name> recognized the rotation of the heavens round the pole star, and saw that
            the dome overhead was but the half of a complete sphere. The earth was thus deprived of the base stretching to unfathomed depths imagined by the
            mythologists, and left free to float as a flattened cylinder at the centre of the celestial sphere. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anaximenes_of_Miletus">Anaximenes</name>, too, seems to have grasped the doctrine of the uniformity of nature,
            teaching that all material transformations must have a true cause.</p>
          <p>Next came <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras">the Pythagoreans</name>, who simplified these conceptions by the
            suggestion that instead of a rotation of the vast sphere of the heavens the earth itself might be a sphere and revolve about a central fixed point,
            like a stone at the end of a string. The uninhabited side of the earth always faced the fixed point, and its inhabited side faced successively the
            different parts of the heavens At the central fixed point they placed a <q>"universal fire,"</q> which, like the fire on an altar, served as a
            centre for the circling of the worshipping earth. Mythology was losing its hold of science, but mystical symbolism still held sway. When, however,
            in the 4th century B.C. the growth of geographical discovery failed to disclose any trace of this central fire, the idea of its existence faded
            away, and was replaced by the conception of the revolution of the earth on its own axis. Finally, <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristarchus_of_Samos">Aristarchus</name> (280 B.C.), believing that the sun was larger than the earth, thought it
            unlikely that it should revolve round the earth, and developed a heliocentric theory. But the time was not ripe; no indisputable evidence could be
            adduced, no general conviction followed, and to mankind the earth remained the centre of creation till many centuries later. Even to <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name>, the visible universe consisted of the central earth with its attendant
            water, air and aether founded by the sphere of the heavens, which formed the flaming walls of the world—<foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic"

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The problem of matter</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Simultaneously with the birth of astronomy the problem of matter came into being. The old Ionian nature philosophers, observing the sequence of
            changes from earth and water into the structure of plants and the bodies of animals, and through them again into the original constituents, began to
            grasp the conception of the indestructibility of matter, and to put forward the idea that all forms of matter might ultimately consist of a single
              <q>"element."</q> But the conception of a single ultimate basis of matter was far in advance of the age. It is only now becoming a fertile working
            hypothesis in the light of all the gigantic increase in knowledge of the intervening two thousand years. At the time when it was put forward, the
            conception was of little use, and the immediate path of advance was found in the idea of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> (450 B.C.) that the primary elements were four: earth, water, air and fire— a
            solid, a liquid, a gas and the flame which seemed to the ancients a type of matter of still rarer structure. This hypothesis served to interpret the
            phenomena of nature for many centuries, till, in modern days, the growth of chemistry disclosed the seventy or eighty elements of our text-books.
            Signs are not wanting that they too have served their turn as a conception of the ultimate nature of matter, while still maintaining their place as
            the proximate units of chemical action.</p>

          <p>In the four elements of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> we trace the germ of the ideas of the
            Atomists. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Empedocles">Empedocles</name> saw that, by combining his separate elements in
            different proportions, he could explain all the endless differences in matter as known to the senses. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus"
              >Democritus</name> developed the conception and gave to the world the theory of atoms, described at a later date by the Roman poet <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name>. As matter is subdivided does it keep its characteristic properties
            throughout? Is iron always iron, however finely we divide it; is water always water? Are the properties of any kind of matter ultimate facts of
            which no explanation—no description in simpler terms—is possible? To avoid answering this last question in the affirmative, and resigning all hope
            of an advance in knowledge, the atomic theory of the Greeks was framed.</p>
          <p>To recognize the significance of the doctrines of the Greek Atomists, we must remove from our minds all sense of comparison with the atomic theory
            of to-day. <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">The Greeks</name> had none of the detailed physical and chemical knowledge
            on which that theory is founded, and which it was framed to explain. The object of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus"
              >Leucippus</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> was quite different from that of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dalton">Dalton</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amedeo_Avogadro">Avogadro</name>. To the latter, the conception of atoms and molecules served as a means of
            explaining certain definite and detailed facts of chemical combination and gaseous volume in a more definite and exact way than any other hypothesis
            available at the time. To the Greek philosophers, the atomic theory was an attempt to make the universe intelligible. The particular explanation
            offered was not of so much importance as the idea that an explanation of some kind was possible. When we see the beliefs that held sway before their
            day, we realize the advance their ideas produced. The qualities of substances were thought to be of their essence—the sweetness of sugar was as much
            a reality as sugar itself, the black colour of water must survive all changes in its form, so that, to one who knew this doctrine, snow could never
            look white again. It was such confusion as this—such denial of facts if they failed to support a theory—that <ref><name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> assailed:— <quote>"According to convention there is a sweet and a bitter, a hot
                and a cold, and according to convention there is colour. In truth there are atoms and a void."</quote></ref> Atoms were many in size and shape,
            but identical in substance. All qualitative differences in substances were to be assigned to differences in size, shape, situation and movement of
            particles of the same ultimate nature. No attempt was made to examine into the nature of this ultimate substance; but one set of phenomena was
            expressed in terms of something simpler, and no <q>"explanation"</q> even of the most recondite observation by the most modern physicist can do
            more.</p>
          <p>The atomic theory of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> as transmitted to us by the poem of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> presented a wonderfully consistent picture of nature within the limits
            of the knowledge of their day. It is easy to show where it fails in the light of the knowledge of phenomena we now possess; it is easy to point to
            places where, as in its application to psychological problems, its authors passed in imagination over logical chasms without even seeing that a
            difficulty existed. But the attempt to frame an intelligible picture was a great step in advance, and a study of the flaws which we can now detect
            may serve to suggest the provisional nature of some of the theories by tbe aid of which knowledge is advancing so fast in our own day.</p>
          <p>But the great difference between the position of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> and that of
            ourselves in regard to natural knowledge consists in the small number of phenomena known to them contrasted with the enormous wealth of accumulated
            observation which is available for us, as the result of years of experiment with the aid of apparatus unknown to the ancients. When a new theory is
            put forward, it is now almost always possible to test its concordance with facts by the use of material already accumulated, or to suggest, in the
            light of such material, experiments which will serve to refute it, or to lend it greater probability. Thus a theory which survives the trials that
            follow its birth has nowadays a fairly long expectation of life—probably the theory will serve to interpret phenomena discovered either by its means
            or in other ways for some time to come. But in the ancient world this was not so. To test a new theory, other phenomena were very rarely available
            than those which suggested it, or to explain which it was put forward. Thus thought was much more speculative, and, as is still the case with
            metaphysics, no general consensus of opinion was reached. Each philosopher had a system of his own in science, just as he still has in metaphysics—a
            system which, beginning from first <pb n="398"/> principles anew, raises on them a superstructure, which, even if it logically follows from them,
            can have no more validity than the premises on which it is based. When the premises are not accepted by other philosophers, the whole scheme becomes
            merely the doctrine of one man, and, if it lives at all, may oppress by the dead weight of authority the struggle of living thought beneath it.</p>

          <p>The history of the atomic theory of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leucippus">Leucippus</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> illustrates the difficulties of a position where speculation has outstripped
            observation. The theory was nearer what is now accepted as truth than any other of the ancient schemes of physics. Yet the grounds on which it was
            based were so insecure that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> (c. 340 B.C), who started with other
            preconceptions, was able to bring to bear such destructive criticism that the theory ceased to occupy the foremost place in Greek thought. Although,
            with the knowledge then available, we can but admit that some of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name>
            criticism was just, much of it consists of metaphysical arguments against the atomists, while in parts he rejects true conclusions owing to what he
            considers their impossibility. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name>, for instance, had held that all
            things would fall with equal speed in a vacuum, and that the fact that heavy bodies were observed to fall faster than very light ones was due to the
            resistance of the air. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus's</name> belief was true, though he was of course
            quite unconscious of the grounds on which it can alone be demonstrated—the universal attraction of gravity, and the remarkable and curious
            experimental fact that the weights of bodies are proportional to their masses. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle"
              >Aristotle</name> agrees that in a vacuum all bodies would fall at an equal rate, but the conclusion appears to him so inconceivable that he
            rejects the idea of the existence of any empty space at all, and with the <q>"void"</q> rejects the rest of the allied concepts of the atomic
            theory. If all bodies were composed of the same ultimate matter, he argues, they must all be heavy, and nothing would be light in itself and
            disposed to rise. A large mass of air or fire would then necessarily be heavier than a small mass of earth or water. This result he thinks
            impossible, for certain bodies always tend upwards and rise faster as their bulk increases. It will be seen that <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> has no idea of the conceptions we now call density and specific gravity, though clear
            views about the question why some things rise through water or air might have been obtained without the aid of physical apparatus. <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> doctrine that bodies are essentially heavy or light in themselves
            persisted all through the middle ages, and did much to delay the attainment of more exact knowledge. It was not till <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</name> (1564-1642) discovered by actual experiment that, in cases where the
            resistance of the air is negligible, heavy things fall at the same speed as light ones, that the Aristotelian dogma was overthrown.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Early biology</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Turning to the biological sciences, we may trace a somewhat similar course of development. Owing to its practical importancc, medicine has left
            many records by which its progress can be traced. Just as primitive man personified the sun and the moon, the wind and the sea, so he regarded
            disease as due to the action of some malignant demon or to the spells of some human enemy. Once more Greek literature enables us to trace the
            gradual decrease in the importance assigned to charms and magic, and the growth of more rational ideas among physicians. But here, as in the
            physical sciences, the philosophic range of the intellect of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> led them
            astray. Assumptions as to the nature of man or the origin of organic life were too often made the starting point of a train of deductive reasoning,
            the consequences of which were not always compared with the results of observation and experiment, even where such comparison was possible. The
            Greek philosophers tried to make bricks without straw, usually in sublime unconsciousness that straw was necessary. Many centuries of humble
            observation and tentative fitting together of small parts of the great puzzle were needed before enough material was collected to make possible
            useful generalizations about the questions, answers to which <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> assumed
            as the very basis of their inquiries.</p>
          <p>Among the multitude of their guesses, a few somewhat resembled the views that are now again rising into prominence from the basis of definite and
            exact experiment. A good example of the strength and weakness of ancient speculation is found in the cosmogony of the atomists, both on its physical
            and on its biological side. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> describes how the world was formed by
            the conjunction of streams of atoms, which condensed into the earth, with its attendant water, air and aether, to form a self-contained whole.
            Unconscious of the mighty gap between inorganic matter and living beings, he proceeds to tell how, in the chances of infinite time, all possible
            forms of life appeared, while only those fittest to survive persisted and reared offspring. Here, surrounded by unsupported statements and false
            conclusions, we see dimly the germs of the ideas of the nebular hypothesis and the theory of natural selection, though <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucretius">Lucretius</name> had the profoundest ignorance of the difficulties of the problem, and the vast
            stretches of time necessary for cosmical and biological development.</p>
          <p>In those branches of biological science in which less ambitious theorizing and more detailed observation were forced on <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name>, considerable progress was made. <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> compiled a laborious account of the animals known in his day, with many accurate
            details of their anatomical structure. Beginning from an earlier date, steady advance was made with geographical discovery. Maps of the known world,
            developed from the local maps invented by the Egyptians for the purposes of landsurveying, gave definiteness to the knowledge thus acquired and
            showed its bearing on wider problems.</p>

        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Geometry</hi></hi></head>
          <p>One of the most striking successes of Greek thought is seen in the development of geometry. Geometry has a twofold importance, as being itself the
            study of the properties of the space known to our senses, and as teaching us methods and means of studying nature by unfolding the full logical
            consequences of any hypothesis: geometry is the best type of deductive reasoning. Based on axioms, the result of simple experience, it traces from
            the ideas of solids, surfaces, lines and points the properties of other figures defined in terms of those ideas. As an example to other sciences,
            the deductive geometry of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid</name> (c. 300 B.C.) had, perhaps, an unfortunate
            influence in emphasizing the deductive method, and teaching men to neglect the need of verifying by experiment the theories put forward to explain
            the more complex phenomena of nature at the conclusion, and at each possible step, of the deduction. But, in itself, the science of Euclidian
            geometry was brought to such a state of perfection that no advance was made till modern times: no change even in form attempted till quite recently.
            Unlike some other branches of inquiry we have mentioned, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Euclid">Euclid's</name> geometry
            carried universal conviction, and represented a permanent step in advance which never had to be retraced.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Theories of knowledge</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Alongside the study of individual sciences, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> paid even more attention
            to the laws of thought, and to the examination of the essence of the methods by which knowledge in general is acquired. In opposition to <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato's</name> theory that all knowledge is but the unfolding and development of forgotten
            memories of a previous state of existence, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> taught that we learn to
            reach the generalizations, which alone <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">the Greeks</name> regarded as knowledge, by
            remembering, comparing and co-ordinating numerous particular acts or judgments of sense, which are thus used as a means of gaining knowledge by the
            action of the innate and infallible nous or intellect. Neither <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> nor <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> could be satisfied without finding infallibility somewhere. <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, it is true, investigated the logical processes by which we pass from
            particular instances to general propositions, and laid stress on the importance of observing the facts before generalizing about them, but he had
            little appreciation of the conditions in which observation and the induction based on it must be conducted in practice in order to obtain results
            where the probability of error is a minimum. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> regarded induction
            merely as a necessary preliminary to true science of the deductive type best seen in geometry, and, in applying his principles, he never reached the
              <q>"positive"</q> stage, in which metaphysical problems are evaded, if not excluded, <pb n="399"/> and a scheme of natural knowledge built up in a
            consistent manner, so that metaphysical ideas, though they may underlie the foundation of the ultimate conceptions, do not intrude between the parts
            of the building. Hence <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> explanations often turn directly on
            metaphysical ideas such as form, cause, substance, terms which do not occur (in the Aristotelian sense) in modern scientific terminology.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The orogin of mechanics</hi></hi></head>
          <p>A century later than the time of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>, <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes of Syracuse</name> (287 to 212 B.C.) formulated the fundamental conceptions of
            hydrostatics and took what may be regarded origin of as the first step in the science of mechanics. The use of the lever must have been discovered
            at a very early date, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes</name> set to work to investigate its
            quantitative laws by the application of principles learnt from the geometers. He begins by laying down two axioms : (1) Equal weights placed at
            equal distances from the point of support of a bar will balance: (2) Equal weights placed at unequal distances do not balance, but that which hangs
            at the greater distance descends. The ancient philosophers based such axioms as the first of these two on the <q>"principle of sufficient
              reason."</q> No motion can take place, because, from the symmetry of the system, there is no reason why the balance should descend on one side
            more than the other. Even if we grant the theoretical validity of this principle, it is impossible to make sure without trial that the system in any
            given case is really symmetrical. Electrification of the bar, for instance, though imperceptible to our senses, would cause one end to descend if an
            oppositely electrified body were placed near that end; we cannot assume without trial that the position of the sun, or the colour of the arms, will
            not affect the result. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes</name> based the second axiom on the sounder
            ground of direct experience. On these two axioms he proceeded to construct an elaborate deductive proof of the numerical law of the lever, but, in
            the course of it, he assumed as known the principle of the centre of gravity. In reality, this principle is identical with that of the lever, and
            assuming one, implicitly we assume the other. Nevertheless, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes'</name>
            proof is of use and interest. On the assumptions made, it shows the connexion between the general case of the lever with unequal arms, and the
            special and more familiar case when the arms are equal. Indeed, if we also treat the principle of the centre of gravity as an axiom known by
            experience, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Archimedes">Archimedes'</name> proof is a true type of all scientific
              <q>"explanations"</q>; it reduces an unfamiliar phenomenon to others already well known to our minds, which, creatures of habit as they are,
            regard the familiar cases as in no need of explanation. Nowadays we should treat the law of the lever of unequal arms as one that is verified by
            direct and familiar experiment, and use it, in its turn, as the starting point for further deduction.</p>

            compendiums written just before the ancient light was wholly lost. During the dark ages, the contents of secular learning, based on those

          <p>With the intellectual revival which began in the 11th century, and the gradual recovery of some of the lost works of the ancient writers, we turn a
            new page. The controversy between <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> upon the doctrine of ideas fascinated the minds of <name type="period"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">the middle ages</name>, saturated as they were with the logical subtleties of dialectic. This
            controversy originated the long debate on the reality of universals, which absorbed the intellectual energies of many generations of men. Did
            reality belong only to the idea or universal—to the class rather than to the individual—to the common humanity of mankind, for instance, rather than
            to each isolated being? Or were the individuals the reality, and the universals mere names? In this question, trivial, almost meaningless, as it
            seems at first sight, logical analysis disclosed to the medieval mind the whole theory of the universe. Either answer contained danger to
            theological orthodoxy as then understood; hence the fervour with which it was debated. But, as communication with the East was reopened early in the
            13th century, Latin translations of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> works gradually were
            recovered; the whole of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle's</name> philosophy was reimported into the
            schools of Europe, and reconciled and adopted by Christian theology. For three hundred years <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> reigned supreme in European thought, and exponents of the scholastic philosophy,
            ignoring their master's teaching on the need of experiment, settled questions of fact as well as those of opinion by an appeal to his books. But
            outside the academic schools of the newly founded universities, experiment was kept alive by the labours of the alchemists, who, early in the 13th
            century, caught their ideas from <name type="people">the Arabs</name>, and began to search for an <foreign xml:lang="la"><hi rend="italic">elixir
                vitae</hi></foreign> and for a means of transmuting baser metals into gold. But alchemy never quite squared its account with orthodox theology,
            and the <q>"sacred science"</q> of the Alexandrians became associated in the medieval mind with the <q>"black art"</q> of witchcraft. Even a man
            like <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roger_Bacon">Roger Bacon</name>, who, with some astrological mysticism, had a more modern
            idea of experiment both in chemical and physical problems, did not escape condemnation.</p>

              >Francis Bacon</name> (1561-1626). Sensible of the confused and disjointed information which then constituted the only scientific knowledge, <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name> set himself to describe a new method by which definite knowledge might
            be acquired with certainty. Warned by the failure of the scholastic methods, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon"
              >Bacon</name> laid exclusive stress on experimental research, and it was perhaps natural that he should incline to the other extreme and ignore
            almost entirely the use of hypothesis and the deductive method. To arrive at the underlying causes, said <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_Bacon">Bacon</name>, we must study the <pb n="400"/> natural history of the phenomena, collect and
            tabulate all obseravtions which bear on them, notice which phenomena are related in such a way as to vary together, and then, by a merely mechanical

            view, it is perhaps but a small drawback that scientific discovery is seldom or never made by the pure Baconian method. The multitude of phenomena
            are too great for any subject to be attacked with success without the aid of hypothesis framed by the use of the scientific imagination. Facts are
            collected to prove or disprove the consequences deduced from the hypothesis, and thus the number of facts to be examined becomes manageable.</p>

              >Galileo</name> sought to find the law of increase. To isolate the real law out of all possible laws he made a guess at a simple law which seemed
            likely to be true. He assumed that the speed acquired is proportional to the distance fallen through. But, working out the consequences of this
            hypothesis, he soon convinced himself that it involved a contradiction. He abandoned the hypothesis and made another. He supposed that the speed was
            proportional to the time of fall. Again he deduced mathematically the consequences of this new hypothesis, and, finding no inconsistencies, put some
            of his deductions to the test of experiment, and verified their accuracy. Thus <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei"
              >Galileo</name> proved mathematically that, if the speed of fall is proportional to the time from the moment of starting, the space traversed by a
            falling body must be proportional to the square of the time of fall. To verify this result experimentally, <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</name> convinced himself that a body falling down an inclined plane acquired a speed
            which is the same as that it would have attained in falling through the same vertical height. He was able therefore to use a slow fall down a plane
            for his experiments instead of the unmanageably rapid course of a body falling freely. Nor was this all. From this stage of the investigation
            another consequence of his results was found to spring. A ball after running down an inclined plane of a certain height will run up another plane of
            the same height irrespective of its inclination—that is, if friction be small. The second plane may be made very long, but still, if its final
            height be the same, the ball will reach its end. Hence it is the height that matters; none of the speed of the ball is destroyed unless it rises. If
            the second plane be made horizontal, the ball will thus run on for ever unless stopped by friction or some other applied force. This fundamental
            result, put into definite words by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name>, is known as the first law of
            motion, and is the foundation of the whole science of dynamics. In <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galileo_Galilei"
              >Galileo's</name> day it was an entirely new conception. It has been assumed that every motion required some cause or force to maintain it. Hence
            arose the need of hypothetical vortices to maintain planetary movements, and similar complications in astronomy and mechanics. But it now became
            evident that it was not the continuous motion of the planets which needed explanation, but the constant deflection of that motion from the straight
            path it would hold if no applied force were in action. The way was open for Newton.</p>

            motion of the planets about the sun could be explained, and explained only, by the supposition that the sun exerted a force on each planet
            proportional inversely to the square of its distance from the planet. But the earth, at any rate, does attract bodies on or near its surface, the
            phenomenon being the familiar but mysterious gravity. Is this force competent to account for the motion of the moon round the earth? On the

            the origin of the rocks of the earth imagined catastrophes of fire or water, processes alien to those of everyday experience. But the
              <q>"uniformitarian"</q> school, founded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Hutton">James Hutton</name> (1726-1797) and
            expounded by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Lyell">Sir Charles Lyell</name> (1797-1875), produced evidence to show
            that much, at any rate, of the structure of the surface of the globe was produced by the action of causes and processes still going on under our
            eyes. The deposition of material by the action of seas and rivers and other natural agencies, e.g. volcanoes, etc., was seen to need only time
            enough to produce beds of rock like those which make up our mountains. Comparison of the fossil remains of plants and animals found in different
            kinds of rock then enabled geologists to classify the rocks, and place them in a chronological sequence. Moreover, it became evident that a series
            of animal and plant types was associated with the gradual formation of the rocks, and that the age both of the earth itself and of the organic life
            found on it was much greater than had been suspected. The few thousand years of received cosmogonies stretched out into untold millions, during
            which the same familiar laws described the phenomena of development. The remains and traces of man, found, it is true, only in the later sedimentary
            deposits of the earth, still were enough to prove his existence through ages beside which the dawn of history was but as yesterday. As <name

            (1809-1882). The origin of living beings from a few ancestral types was an old conception, but Darwin first found an adequate intelligible cause in
            the slow action of sexual selection, joined to the pressure <pb n="401"/> of the struggle for life, which allowed only those individuals most suited
            by favourable variation to the environment to survive and rear their offspring. The advantage thus given to beings with useful variations may
            develop into permanent modifications in the course of ages, and, when the parent types have disappeared, their common posterity may exhibit the
            marked differences characteristic of the separate and distinct species now existent. From the point of view of scientific thought, the significance

          <p>Both before and after the appearance of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin's</name> work, biologists
            devoted their attention to the study of how the useful variations arise. Three views have been held. (1) <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Jean Baptiste, chevalier de Lamarck</name> (1744-1829), regarded variation as due to the
            accumulated and inherited effect of use. Thus the giraffe acquires his long neck by the successive efforts of countless generations to browse on
            leaves just beyond their reach. (2) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name>, while accepting changes in
            accordance with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck">Lamarck's</name> ideas as exceptional aids to variation,
            revolutionized biology by showing the primary importance of the struggle for life, when extended over long periods of time, in selecting useful
            variations which arise accidentally or in other ways. (3) <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Darwin">Darwin</name> also
            recognized the possible occasional effect of discontinuous variations or <quote>"sports,"</quote> when a plant or an animal diverges from its
            parents in a marked manner. But of late years the study by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hugo_de_Vries">Hugo de Vries</name>,

            are of no advantage in incipient stages. Statistical methods, too, suggest that a definite limit may exist to the amount of a given variation which

          <p>A new light has been thrown on the problem of inheritance by the recent re-discovery of the work of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gregor_Mendel">G.J. Mendel, abbot of Brunn</name> (1822-1884). Certain characters in both plants and animals have
            been found to be separable, and some of these characters exist in pairs, so that the presence of one involves the absence of the other. To take a
            simple example. Blue Andalusian fowls do not breed <q>"true."</q> On the average, half the offspring of two blue parents are blue, while the
            remaining half are divided equally between black and white birds. Both black and white when mated with a consort of the same colour breed
              <q>"true"</q> and yield only offspring similar to the parents. A white bird mated with a black, however, produces invariably all blue chicks.
            White mated with blue gives half blue and half white, while black mated with blue gives half blue and half black. Such phenomena are explained if we
            suppose that of the germ cells of the blue birds half bear the black character and half the white. If, in reproduction, a <q>"black"</q> cell meets
            a <q>"black"</q> the resulting chick is black; if <q>"white"</q> meets <q>"white"</q> the chick is white; while if <q>"white"</q> meets
              <q>"black"</q> the chick possesses a mixture of the two characters which in this case yield blue colour. But the reproductive cells of this
            intermediate form are not intermediate in character; they possess the pure parental characters in equal numbers. Knowing these facts, it is evident
            that we can reproduce any of the results at will, and from the mixed blue type produce a pure true breed of either black or white birds. Experiments
            of this kind must lead to a power of breeding new varieties of plants and animals hitherto undreamed of, and already have changed altogether our
            views of the problems of heredity. Instead of a vague mixture of all our ancestors, we possess definite characteristics of some of them only,
            though, like the blue Andalusian fowl, we may transmit to our children ancestral characters we do not ourselves exhibit. The family or race is more
            important in heredity than the individual parent. Thus the aristocratic theory of politics receives support from the experience of biology.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The theory of energy.</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Simultaneously with the growth of geology, and the birth of the Darwinian hypothesis, a new development took place in physical science—the
            development of the conception of energy as a quantity invariable in amount throughout a series of physical changes. The genesis of the idea in its
            modern form may be traced in the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isaac_Newton">Newton</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christiaan_Huygens">C. Huygens</name> (1629-1695), who applied it to the problems of pure dynamics. But, in the
            middle of the 19th century, by the work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Prescott_Joule">James Prescott Joule</name>
            (1818-1889), <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</name> (1824-1907), <name

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">J. Willard Gibbs</name> (1839-1903), <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rudolf_Clausius">R.J.E. Clausius</name> (1822-1888) and others, it was extended to physical processes. The amount
            of heat produced by friction was found to bear a constant proportion to the work expended, and this experimental result led to the conception of an
            invariable quantity of something, to which the name of energy was given, manifesting itself in various forms such as heat or mechanical work. Energy
            thus took its place beside mass as a real quantity, conserved throughout a series of physical changes. Of late years, as we shall see below,
            evidence has appeared to show that mass is not absolutely constant, but may depend on the velocity when the velocity approaches that of light. Since
            the only essential quality of matter is its mass, this result seems to strike at the root of the metaphysical conception of matter as a real,
            invariable quantity. It remains to be seen whether the conception of energy as an invariable quantity will hold its place or give way to some
            similar modification as science develops. But, in the present state of knowledge, we may accept the principle of the conservation of energy as one
            of the most firmly established of physical laws.</p>
          <p>The amount of energy in an isolated system remains invariable, but, if changes are going on in the system, the energy tends continually to become
            less and less available for the performance of useful work. All heat engines require a difference of temperature— a boiler and refrigerator, or
            their equivalents. We cannot continue to transform heat into mechanical work if all available objects are at a uniform temperature. But, if
            temperature differences exist, they tend to equalize themselves by irreversible processes of thermal conduction, and it becomes increasingly
            difficult to get useful work out of the supplies of heat. In an isolated system, then, equilibrium will be reached when this process of
              <q>"dissipation of energy"</q> is complete, and, from this single principle, the whole theory of the equilibrium of physical and chemical systems
            was worked out by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs">Willard Gibbs</name>. Such a method avoids altogether
            the use of atomic and molecular conceptions. In fact, some supporters of the theory of <q>"energetics"</q> expressly disclaim the conceptions of
            natural atoms and molecules as unnecessary and misleading, and prefer to found all science on the idea of energy. Matter, they argue, is known to us
            only as a vehicle for energy, and may itself be but a manifestation of that energy.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The theory of electric ions</hi></hi></head>
          <p>But the other great line of advance in recent physics, although it may lead us in the end to somewhat similar conclusions, has been traced by a
            method which used atomic and molecular conceptions in an extreme form. The passage of electricity through liquids had been explained by <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Michael_Faraday">Michael Faraday</name> (1791-1867) and others as a transference of a succession of
            electric charges carried by <pb n="402"/> moving particles of matter or ions. At the end of the 19th century these ideas were extended, chiefly by
            the labours of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">J.J. Thomson</name>, to elucidate also the conduction of
            electricity through gases. In 1897 <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">Thomson</name> discovered that, in certain
            cases, the moving particles which carried the electric current were of much smaller mass than the smallest chemical atom, that of hydrogen, and that
            these minute particles, to which he gave the name of corpuscles, were identical from whatever substance they were obtained. They enter into the
            structure of all matter, and form a common constituent of all chemical atoms. The only known properties of these corpuscles are their mass and their
            electric charge. Now, a charged body when set in motion spreads electromagnetic energy into the surrounding medium. Thus, more force is needed to
            produce a given acceleration than if the body were uncharged. The body acts as though its mass were greater than when it is uncharged. Now there is
            reason to believe that the whole apparent mass of the minute corpuscles to which we have referred is an effect of their electric charge. The idea of
            a material particle thus disappears with that of material mass, and the corpuscle becomes an isolated unit of electricity— an electron. It is
            impossible to resist making the speculation that the whole of an atom is made up of electrons, and that mass is to be explained in terms of
            electricity, though it must be pointed out that there is no conclusive evidence in favour of this hypothesis.</p>
          <p>Another train of reasoning, starting from a different point, reinforces this result. The phenomena of the interference of beams of light in certain
            circumstances, to produce darkness or colour, indicate that light is some form of wave motion, and, to carry these waves, a hypothetical
            luminiferous aether was invented. The theoretical work of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Clerk_Maxwell">J. Clerk
              Maxwell</name> (1831-1879) and the experiments of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Hertz">H.R. Hertz</name>
            (1857-1894) showed that the properties and velocity of propagation of light and of electromagnetic waves were identical and that their other
            properties differed only in degree. Thus light became an electromagnetic phenomenon. But light is started by some form of atomic vibration, and to
            start an electromagnetic wave requires a moving electric charge. Thus electric charges must exist within the atom, and we are led again to the
            theory of electrons by the road opened up by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hendrik_Lorentz">H.A. Lorentz</name> and <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Larmor">Joseph Larmor</name>. Such a theory suggests the occasional instability of the atom,
            and the phenomena of radioactivity, shown in a remarkable form by the substance radium, discovered by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre_Curie">M.</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marie_Curie">Mme. Curie</name>,
            have been explained satisfactorily by the theory of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ernest_Rutherford">E. Rutherford</name> and

            disintegration of the atom. The evolutionary view of nature, established in the biological and sociological sciences, is thus extended to physical
            science, not only in the development of planets and suns, but even in the chemical atoms, hitherto believed indestructible and eternal.</p>

            Baconian method in its purity would be too laborious for success. Some guide is necessary in the collection of facts at an early stage of our
            investigations. Here the scientific imagination is brought into play, and some hypothesis is framed to explain the phenomena under investigation.
            The hypothesis may be suggested by the theories which are accepted at the time in cognate branches of knowledge, or it may be suggested by the few
            isolated facts already known or just discovered in the phenomena to be considered. From this new hypothesis, consequences are deduced by processes
            of logical reasoning—consequences which may be put to the test by comparison with the results of observation or experiment. If agreement is found,
            the hypothesis is, so far, confirmed, and gains in authority with every fresh concordance discovered. If the deductions from the hypothesis do not
            agree with the accepted interpretation of facts, the hypothesis may need modification, it may have to be abandoned altogether, or the want of
            concordance may point to some error or inconsistency in the fundamental concepts on which the hypothesis is based—the whole framework of that branch
            of science may need revision, as the idea of heat as a caloric substance had to be abandoned under the pressure of the experiments of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Prescott_Joule">Joule</name> on the equivalence between work done and heat developed. But the
            ultimate test of the validity of our knowledge can only be the consistency with each other of the parts of the whole scheme. If the received
            interpretation of one set of phenomena is not consistent with that of another, one or other or both of the interpretations must be wrong if we make
            the assumption necessary for all knowledge, namely, that the universe is intelligible to a mind capable of dealing with its complexity.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The classification of sciences</hi></hi></head>
          <p>In early times, when the knowledge of nature was small, little attempt was made to divide science into parts, and men of science did not
            specialize. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name> was a master of all science known in his day, and wrote
            indifferently treatises on physics or animals. As increasing knowledge made it impossible for any one man to grasp all scientific subjects, lines of
            division were drawn for convenience of study and of teaching. Besides the broad distinction into physical and biological science, minute
            subdivisions arose, and, at a certain stage of development, much attention was given to methods of classification, and much emphasis laid on the
            results, which were thought to have a significance beyond that of the mere convenience of mankind.</p>
          <p>But we have reached the stage when the different streams of knowledge, followed by the different sciences, are coalescing, and the artificial
            barriers raised by calling those sciences by different names are breaking down. Geology uses the methods and data of physics, chemistry and biology;
            no one can say whether the science of radioactivity is to be classed as chemistry or physics, or whether sociology is properly grouped with biology
            or economics. Indeed, it is often just where this coalescence of two subjects occurs, when some connecting channel between them is opened suddenly,
            that the most striking advances in knowledge take place. The accumulated experience of one department of science, and the special methods which have
            been developed to deal with its problems, become suddenly available in the domain of another department, and many questions insoluble before may
            find answers in the new light cast upon them. Such considerations show us that science is in reality one, though we may agree to look on it now from
            one side and now from another as we approach it from the standpoint of physics, physiology or psychology.</p>

        <div type="article">
          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">The philosophical basis of science</hi></hi></head>
          <p>Having traced the development of the most important of the fundamental conceptions of science, and followed the subdivision of natural knowledge
            into the various sections which for convenience mankind has made, let us now examine the meaning of the knowledge thus acquired, and its relation to
            other branches of learning.</p>
          <p>By the slow and laborious methods of observation, hypothesis, deduction, and experimental verification, a scheme has been constructed which for the
            most part is consistent with itself, and bears the test of the comparison of one part with another. As a chart is drawn by the explorer of unknown
            seas to represent his discoveries in a conventional manner, so the scientific investigator constructs a mental model of the phenomena he observes,
            and tests its consistency with itself and its concordance with the results of further experiment. The chart does not give a lifelike picture of the
            coast as does a painting, but it represents one aspect of it conventionally in a manner best adapted for the immediate purpose. So the conceptions
            of one branch of science— mechanics let us say—represent the phenomena of nature in the conventional aspect best suited for one particular line of
            inquiry. It does not follow necessarily that <q>"nature"</q> in reality resembles the particular mental chart which mechanical science enables us to
            construct. It does not even follow that there is any <q>"reality"</q> underlying phenomena and corresponding with any of our conceptions. The whole
            problem which mankind has to face <pb n="403"/> undoubtedly includes an inquiry into the ultimate nature of reality. But that inquiry lies in the
            province of metaphysics, and is not necessarily involved in the pursuit of natural science. Metaphysics uses the results of natural science, as of
            all other branches of learning, as evidence bearing on her own deeper and more difficult questions. But it does not follow that natural science must
            solve metaphysical problems before being of use to man and enlarging the sphere of his knowledge. We need not ask whether the reality is represented
            accurately by our conventional model, whether indeed there be any reality at all, before using that model to introduce order into what would
            otherwise be mental confusion, and to enable us to make systematic and progressive use of natural resources. It is true that the possibility of
            constructing consistent schemes of scientific concepts is an argument in favour of the existence of a definite reality underlying phenomena
            resembling in some respects the pictures of it we draw. But metaphysicians are not agreed that it is a conclusive argument. The difficulty of making
            a scientific picture of the ultimate nature of reality may be illustrated by an example. Our first conception of a wooden stick involves the ideas
            of a certain long-shaped form, of smoothness, of hardness, of weight, of a certain brown colour, perhaps of some amount of elasticity. A microscope
            reveals a structure much more detailed than we imagined, and our mental model of the stick ceases to be smooth It becomes co-ordinated with those of
            a number of other bodies' which we know to be parts of trees, and study, as regards growth and structure, by the help of botany. From the results of
            observation and experiment, physics teaches us that the properties of the stick can only be represented satisfactorily by imagining that the
            substance of it is not infinitely divisible, that it consists of discontinuous particles or molecules. Again, chemistry assures us that the
            molecules of the stick are made up of still smaller parts or atoms, which separate from each other when, for instance, the stick is burned, and
            afterwards can arrange themselves into new molecules. When we pursue our inquiries into the nature of these atoms, we find that they can be
            resolved, partly at any rate, into much smaller particles or corpuscles in continual motion within the atom. These corpuscles themselves have been
            identified with isolated units of negative electricity or electrons, the vibrations of which within the atom sort out the electromagnetic radiation
            which falls on them and allow to reach our eyes those waves only which give us the sensation of brown colour. At present pioneers are attempting to
            explain electrons in terms of centres of elastic strain in a hypothetical aether. But we have travelled far from our original conception of the
            nature of the stick, and, should the problem last stated be solved, we should only find ourselves faced by the next one, the nature of the aether.
            But what constitutes reality? Where, in the endless chain of explanations discovered or to be discovered, can we stop and say: <q>"Here is the true
              picture of what the stick is"</q>? But this impossibility does not prevent us from getting the full use of each conception in turn when used for
            its particular purpose. To the schoolboy, the effective and deterrent conception of the stick is that of a hard, elastic, long-shaped solid. The
            botanist regards it as built up by the action of vegetable cells, which he refers to a particular kind of tree. To the chemist the stick is made up
            of atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, each with definite properties and arranged in certain combinations. The physicist sees these atoms composed
            of whirling electrons, each an ultimate electric unit not capable of further explanation, or possibly a centre of strain in an all-pervading aether
            of unknown nature. Each idea is useful in turn, and each corresponds truly with certain properties of the stick, corresponds with the stick itself
            in certain of its aspects.</p>
          <p>Such considerations show us the meaning of the subdivisions into which science has been arranged for convenience of study and research. They
            represent different aspects of nature, different sections, as it were, cut through the solid model which stands for the sum of all our scientific
            knowledge of the universe.</p>
          <p>A nerve-impulse may be regarded from a psychological aspect when we deal with the thought which accompanied it; from a physiological aspect when we
            examine its relation to other changes in the body. But modern methods have co-ordinated it also with definite chemical and electrical changes, and
            are said sometimes to have <q>"explained"</q> the nerve-impulse in physical terms.</p>
          <p>But, as always, an <q>"explanation"</q> proves to be simply a restatement of a phenomenon in terms of other phenomena which previously are familiar
            to the mind, and therefore appear to be better understood. Nevertheless, from our present point of view, no one of these possible aspects of the
            phenomenon—of the nerve impulse— is essentially more fundamental than any other. To the psychologist the nerve-impulse is expressed in terms of
            thought, to the physicist by physical changes. The fact that a thought is accompanied by movement of matter or electricity does not make the thought
            less a fundamental conception.</p>
          <p>But perhaps the best illustration is to be sought in the relation between the physical concepts of matter and electricity. As we have seen, <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/J._J._Thomson">J.J. Thomson</name> discovered corpuscles which were common constituents of all
            matter, with masses smaller than those of any known atoms. One of these corpuscles represents a unit of negative electricity. An atom with a
            corpuscle in excess is an atom negatively electrified, an atom with one corpuscle less than the normal number is an atom positively electrified. In
            this scheme electricity is described in terms of matter. But these corpuscles have been identified with the hypothetical electrons of <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hendrik_Lorentz">Lorentz</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_Larmor">Larmor</name>, who consider matter to be composed of such isolated units of electricity. Such
            electrons, it has been shown, would possess mass by virtue of their electromagnetic properties. In this theory the idea of mechanical mass is
            eliminated altogether, and mass, and therefore matter, explained in terms of electricity. The view has been held by some that a mechanical
            explanation of a phenomenon is fundamental, and that a phenomenon so explained in terms of mechanical conceptions is fully understood. This idea may
            be traced to the familiarity with mechanical conceptions of our everyday experience. The mind obtains its concept of matter from the resistance
            which that matter manifests to forces tending to set it in motion when at rest, or to change its state of motion when travelling. This fundamental
            property of inertia is the measure of mass, and we reach the concept of mass by our muscular sense of the force needed to set mass in motion. Force
            seems to be a direct sense perception, though mathematically it is better to define force in terms of acceleration and mass—since mass is found
            normally to keep constant throughout a series of physical changes. The familiarity we feel, then, with the conception of matter is based on our
            familiarity with the conception of force. Our minds form this conception from their experience of a direct sense perception of muscular effort. This
            seems to be the basis of the whole feeling that mechanical conceptions are more fundamental than any others, and that, for instance, it is more
            intelligible to explain electricity in terms of mechanics than vice versa. But the fact that we have a special muscular sense is an accident of our
            bodies. It is possible that the electric fish, or torpedo, has a special electric sense, and that to such a fish-philosopher the perception of
            electromotive force is more real than that of mechanical force. Such a being might well argue that it is intelligible and satisfactory to explain
            the mysterious concept of mass, which he only reaches through the other equally mysterious concept of mechanical force, in terms of the familiar
            concept of electricity, well known to every torpedo from his direct sense perception of electromotive force. This instance may serve to show that it
            is quite as correct philosophically to explain matter in terms of electricity, as to explain electricity in terms of mass. The object of science is
            to find connexions between phenomena and thus to correlate them. At present a greater simplification may be reached by reducing all possible
            phenomena to mechanical conceptions than in any other way, but that only shows that the mechanical aspect of nature gives us a fuller view than any
            other at present known, not that mechanics is philosophically the most fundamental science.</p>

          <p>In international law the term has a more precise meaning, according to which the state is the external personality or outward agency of an
            independent community. In its fullest form its attributes are: <list>

            </cit> In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>, where the state embraces a hierarchy of bodies and authorities
            culminating in the president of the republic, whose acts are the final form of a series of incomplete acts of the members of the hierarchy, it comes
            nearer to the theoretical meaning of the word. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name> the
            sovereign power of the state is diffused among a number of authorities which have rights against each other and stand in independent relation
            towards the individual citizens. Actions can be brought by private citizens in the ordinary law courts against individual authorities, and there is
            no system of hierarchical responsibility which prevents a state official from being personally accountable for his administrative conduct. In

            system of entire subordination of the organs to the state as a whole, and the less logical British system is dwelt upon. <quote>"Few things," he
              observes, "are more instructive than the examination of the actions which have been brought in <name type="place"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name> against officers for retaining ships about to proceed to sea. Under
                <title>the Merchant Shipping Act 1876</title> the board are open to detain any ship which, from its unsafe and unseaworthy condition, is a
              serious danger to human life."</quote><quote>"Most persons would suppose that the officials of the board of trade, so long as they—bona fide and
              without malice or corrupt motive—endeavour to carry out the provisions of the statute, would be safe from action at the hands of a shipowner.
              This, however, is not so. The board and its officers have more than once been sued with success. They have never been accused of either malice or
              negligence, but the mere fact that the board acts in an administrative capacity is not a protection to the board; nor is mere obedience to the
              orders of the board an answer to an action against its servants"</quote><ref>(p. 324)</ref>.</p>
          <p>In <name type="place" key="In http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, we may say, the notion of state, from the constitutional point
            of view, is still inchoate, but the play of international intercourse seems to be gradually leading to a clearer conception of the fact that an
            increasing national responsibility requires a corresponding increase in the power of co-ordinate state control. An instance of its absence is shown
            by the loose way in which <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom">the British Crown</name> has
            granted governing powers to chartered companies (<ref>see RAID</ref>). This uncertainty applies as much to <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name> as to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain"
              >Great Britain</name>. In the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louisiana">Louisiana</name> lynching riots, of which some
            Italian citizens were the victims, it was contended that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name>
            government was not responsible, and that the responsibility fell upon the government of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louisiana">Louisiana</name> alone. This contention could not be pressed, and compensation was of course paid to
              <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name>. Similar difficulties arose in connexion with the Japanese school question
            in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/California">California</name>. The subject is well known to have raised apprehension as to
            the adequacy of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name> system to meet its centralized state
            responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Another, and, in some respects, more dangerous feature of an inchoate conception of state responsibility is the growing apart, so to speak, of
            certain British dependencies. The British state, for international purposes, is <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Empire">the British Empire</name>, for domestic purposes it is <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name>. Any limb of the former's huge body can have interests different from
            those of <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">the United Kingdom</name>, and involve its responsibility. A
            significant step towards concentration of liability and control was taken by the Australian colonies in the federation brought about by <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Constitution_of_Australia">the Commonwealth Act of 1900</title>. Under this act, by the way, an element of

            the subject is dealt with as an independent branch of university education. Several of her universities have a <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi
                rend="italic">staatswissenschaftliche Fakultät</hi></foreign>, granting a special degree in the subject. In consequence of the great attention
            paid to the subject in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>, her state policy has been largely the work of
            her political writers. The result has not unnaturally tended to a system bearing some resemblance to that of <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the American Union</name>, with this very important difference, however, that whereas in <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the United States</name> the federal power is derived from the democratic forces of
            the individual states, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name> it is derived from their aristocratic and
            absolutist forces. German political thinkers, in fact, have worked out <foreign xml:lang="de"><hi rend="italic">Staatsrecht</hi></foreign> as a
            comparative study, in which arguments in favour of absolute government have received as much careful consideration as those in favour of democratic
            institutions, and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">the German state</name> has developed upon lines based on the
            best theoretical arguments of these thinkers. There is, therefore, no anomaly in its practically absolutist government working out the most
            democratic reforms as yet put into legislative form. It follows, however, that <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany"
              >German</name> theories are of little use in the consideration of the state problems with which <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">British</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States"
              >American</name> political thinkers have to deal. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anglosphere">Anglo-Saxon</name> institutions
            are following their independent development, and if the influence of foreign institutions is felt at all, it is probably that of the clear logical
