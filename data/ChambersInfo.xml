            political animal ; that is, he loves to herd
            with his fellows - to live in society. There are,
            indeed, instances of men fleeing society, and
            spending existence in solitude, but these unhappily
            disposed individuals form rare exceptions to the

                <head>FAMILY RELATIONSHIP - MARRIAGE.</head>
                <p>The origin of civilisation has recently been the
          object of earnest investigation by numerous inquirers,
          who seem to have made it clear that in
          the lowest stages of savage life the family relation
          does not exist. The same authorities hold that all
          branches of the human race have passed through
          this lowest stage. Be this as it may, the formation
          of the family is the first step toward the
          formation of the civilised community. A family
          consists of husband, wife, children. This is not
          an accidental or arbitrary arrangement. The
          family originates in the necessities of our nature,
          and springs up inevitably wherever that nature
          develops itself. Accordingly, all attempts to
          encroach on the obligations or the privileges of
          the family are simply attacks on civilisation.
          In antiquity, slaves were regarded by their masters,
          and regarded themselves, as members of the
          family, and it is a very poor account of Christianity
          if a less kindly and intimate relation
          prevails between masters and servants in modern
          times. The relation of master and servant, by
          whatever name we choose to call it, is necessary
          for the purposes of civilisation, and is founded on
          nature, just as much as the relation between parents
          and children, or husbands and wives. If
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God">God</name> has bestowed a progressive nature on man,
          he must have intended that some men should, by
          the aid of others, be freed from domestic occupations
          which, by absorbing their time, would prevent
          them from devoting themselves to those
          pursuits on which progress depends. The relation
          between master and servant is one of mutual
          obligation. It imposes duties on the former as
          well as on the latter, and it is a very low view of
          it, particularly within the domestic circle, to
          regard it as a mere pecuniary arrangement.</p>
                <p>The fundamental object of the family compact
          is a due provision for the affections, and for the
          nurture and education of rational beings, and free
          and orderly citizens. This is insured by the
          matrimonial engagement—a solemn covenant between
          a man and a woman to attach themselves
          to each other through all the contingencies of life,
          till the death of either dissolve the union. In
          every nation removed from barbarism, marriage
          is a recognised ordinance, guarded by law and
          custom. In some eastern countries, polygamy, or
          the marriage of a man with many wives, has long
          been tolerated; but that relations of this kind are
          unnatural, is testified by the fact, that polygamy is
          degrading to the female sex, unfavourable to the
          rearing of children, and that it is inconsistent with the numerical equality of the sexes. In all
          countries in which polygamy is tolerated, woman
          occupies a degraded position, and society is rude
          and unexpansive in its character. Nature has designed
          woman to be the equal of man as a moral
          and intellectual being ; and when she confines herself
          to the exercise of her proper duties as a wife
          and mother, she is placed in a favourable position
          as regards her own happiness and the happiness
          of her husband. And all this can only be realised
          by monogamy - the marriage of a man with but
          one wife. We have deemed it necessary to state
          thus unequivocally at the outset what appear to
          be the primary principles of human relationship;
          for there are not wanting those who would
          endeavour to rear systems of society in which the
          family compact is to have no place, and parental
          care is to be absolved from its duties—a dream
          which the common-sense of mankind will ever
          reject as visionary.</p>
                <p>Society, as has been shewn, is necessarily composed
          of distinct families. The manner, however,
          in which these families should associate with
          respect to each other, is a question which has
          been often agitated, and here deserves some
          degree of notice. The true explanation, we think,
          lies in an appeal to nature.</p>
                <p>It would appear that from the beginning of the
          world every nation has consisted of a certain
          number of families, and that each family, in its
          general circumstances, has been independent of
          others. Families, in the patriarchal times, may
          have been less or more dependent on, or connected
          with the head of a tribe ; but we nowhere read of
          families yielding up their individual identity, and
          living in private community with each other. In
          all the higher races of mankind, at anyrate, each
          family has always had its own house, its own joys,
          sorrows, hopes, fears, and historical traditions.
          Each father of a family, a sovereign within his
          own domain, has been left to govern his little
          realm, and to undertake the obligation of finding
          his wife, children, and domestics in the means of
          daily subsistence.</p>
                <p>A practice so universal cannot be supposed to
          be a violation of either nature or convenience. It
          has sprung up from the wants and feelings of
          mankind, and may be said to be a spontaneous
          result of unalterable circumstances. Tracing it
          to its true source in the mental and physical
          constitution, we find that it affords the widest
          scope for personal enterprise, perseverance, and
          other useful emotions. It is an error to suppose
          that it is selfish in principle, because it is the
          form of existence which best ministers to the good
          of the whole state, and even the whole community
          of mankind, as well as to that of each separate
          household.</p>
                <p>In opposition to the exclusiveness inseparable
          from the family relations, it is urged that, by
          leaving society to spontaneous arrangement, there
          comes a time when each nation is consumed by
          its internal disorders. The clever, the industrious,<pb n="1"/>and the persevering become wealthy ; vast numbers,
          either from lack of capacity or opportunity,
          sink into a state of extreme indigence ; and a
          number become criminals, and prey on the rest.
          There is truth in this severe statement of facts ;
          for in every nation there are rich and poor, good
          and bad. Nevertheless, such a mingled tissue is
          an inevitable consequence, not of the structure of
          society, but of human nature, on which society is
          founded. We must seek a remedy in the improvement
          of man's moral and intellectual constitution,
          not in subverting the whole organisation of society,
          and attempting to reunite it on fantastic principles
          at variance with nature. Nor should any alarm
          be entertained respecting the lamentable evils
          which seem to be inseparable from society as it at
          present exists. These evils, and they are great,
          will never utterly disappear, because human perfection
          is unattainable, but they will in time be
          much modified. In every region, society goes
          through a period of barbarism, during which many
          cruelties are perpetrated and privations endured ;
          after this, as men become enlightened, the worst
          kind of evils gradually disappear, and others of
          lesser severity remain. At present, society in
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name> and most civilised nations is in a
          transition state from barbarism to enlightenment.
          Within even the recollection of men now living,
          the steps in advance have been considerable, and
          every year adds to the number of both physical
          and social meliorations. Whatever may be the
          fate of individuals or nations who, from sensuality,
          vanity, and other forms of selfishness, neglect
          their duties to others and to themselves, there can
          be no reasonable doubt that society, as an institution
          of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God">God</name> and nature, will continue to improve,
          and that much that is now matter for regret and
          reproach will be amended or removed.</p>

                <head>UTOPIAN COMMUNITIES.</head>
                <p>Ingenious men have at different times conceived
          to themselves the idea of a state of society, or
          republic, in which vice, sorrow, indolence, poverty,
          and other evils shall either be unknown, or at
          least reduced to a scarcely perceptible amount.
          None of these theories has gained so much
          celebrity as that announced by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_More">Sir Thomas More</name>,
          under the name of Utopia (from a <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language">Greek</name> word
          signifying <hi rend="italic">no place</hi>). The author was Chancellor
          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> in 
          the reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII.</name> and was
          a man of the highest and most honourable character.
          His work was written in <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin">Latin</name>, and the
          elegance with which he propounded his apparently
          benevolent but really satirical scheme, has
          made the name of his imaginary republic to be
          adopted in our language as a current expression
          to denote any plan of social economy which is
          founded on views of human nature too favourable
          to be practicable.</p>
                <p>The work was written not long after the discovery
          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Americas">America</name>, near which continent, south
          of the line, the island of Utopia is supposed to lie.
          The story of discovering this island is represented
          as being told by a venerable traveller, whom the
          author met at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antwerp">Antwerp</name>.</p>

                    </bibl>, which has been the parent of all such
          proposals. In later times, schemes not very dissimilar
          have been seriously proposed by benevolent 
          speculators, and partly carried into practice,
          though with no prospect of permanent continuance.
          At the head of this class of projectors
          may be mentioned <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Owen">Robert Owen</name> 
          and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Fourier">Fourier</name>, the
          latter a religious enthusiast in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>. Generally
          stated, these plans consist in causing fifty or
          a hundred families, as the case may be, to live
          in one community, in which all are to labour for
          the general behoof, and all to be supported on
          equal terms out of the common stock. Individual
          property is to be unknown ; all personal feelings
          are to be sunk in that of the community. How it
          is proposed to meet differences as to the education
          of children, religious belief, and other important
          matters - how evil passions are to be extinguished,
          or what is to be the consequence of the idle preying
          on the industrious, has never been satisfactorily
          explained. According to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Fourier">Fourier</name>, we believe,
          members seriously transgressing the rules are to
          be expelled the community ; which amounts to a
          giving up of the whole principle. If the community
          cannot reclaim and retain its evil-disposed
          members, the scheme is confessedly worthless.
          Defective as ordinary society is allowed
          to be, it does not eject the most vicious or the
          most improvident of its members - for the criminal
          it finds prisons and penitentiaries, and to the
          poor and starving it offers workhouses ; even the
          most dissolute can pick up an alms. The fundamental
          error of all such schemes consists in the
          notion that society is the result of human ingenuity,
          and admits of being reconstructed and
          remodelled at will ; whereas it rests upon natural
          laws, and results from individual characteristics,
          which are as unchangeable in their action as those
          which govern growth and decay in the vegetable
          world. It is no more possible to make all men
          equally good, and wise, and happy, than to make all
          trees grow equally straight or equally tall. And out
          of the natural inequalities and diversities of gifts and
          endowments, spring the inequalities of means, and
          the diversities of position - in a word, the whole
          organic structure of society as it exists, and, with
          such improvements as advancing civilisation may
          bring along with it, always must exist. By observing
          its laws, we may improve the condition
          of its individual members, as we may improve the
          plants in our gardens by observing the character
          of the soil, and the effect of the means which we
          employ to enrich it. But we can no more change
          their individual characteristics, or obviate the
          consequences and relations which naturally result
          from their peculiarities, than we can convert
          onions into apples, or make plants grow with
          their roots in the air.</p>

                <head>PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY - CLANSHIP.</head>
                <p>The patriarchal condition of society has prevailed
          in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name> and other eastern countries from
          the most remote periods of history. It is the
          most simple kind of social union. A patriarch, so
          called from a word signifying father or head of a
          family, is the head or governor of a tribe, who obey
          his orders, and depend in a great measure on his
          judgment. Generally, the office of patriarch is
          hereditary, but it is also sometimes elective,
          though very generally in the same family. The
          most distinguished of the ancient patriarchs was
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abraham">Abraham</name>, the great 
          progenitor of the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrews">Hebrew</name>
          nation, who was originally a dweller in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name>.<pb n="2"/>The 
          leaders of tribes in these pastoral regions
          are now known by the title of <hi rend="italic">Sheiks</hi> - the word
          sheik in <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabic_language">Arabic</name> signifying the elder or eldest.</p>
                <p>In this rudimentary state of society, the tribe has
          usually no fixed residence, but wanders from place
          to place in company with its flocks and herds, in
          quest of pasture, or for the sake of hunting wild
          animals. In making their long and toilsome
          journeys through the wilderness, the families and
          tents are carried on the backs of camels. From
          leading this wandering life, the members of these
          tribes are called <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/NOMAD">
                        <hi rend="italic">Nomades</hi>
                    </name> ; or 
          are said to be <hi rend="italic">nomadic</hi>
          in their habits, from a <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language">Greek</name> word signifying
          pastoral.</p>
                <p>From the accounts given of the patriarchal
          ages in the <bibl>

                    </bibl>, a much more favourable idea is
          formed of nomadic life than a close inspection
          is found to warrant. Carried away with pleasing
          fancies respecting pastoral simplicity and freedom
          from the cares of civilisation, we are apt to forget
          that human passions are the same in all ages and
          countries, and that every condition of life has its
          own peculiar difficulties and vexations. The truth
          seems to be, that this roving, haphazard mode of
          existence is full of miseries, and that force is the
          only law. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lloyd_Stephens">Mr Stephens</name>,

          which had been thrown over the nomadic social
          system :</p>
                <p>
                    <quote>'One by one I had seen the many illusions of
          my waking dreams fade away ; the gorgeous pictures
          of oriental scenes melt into nothing ; but
          I had still clung to the primitive simplicity and
          purity of the children of the desert, their temperance
          and abstinence, their contented poverty and
          contempt for luxuries, as approaching the true
          nobility of man's nature, and sustaining the poetry
          of the "land of the East." But my last dream was
          broken ; and I never saw among the wanderers of
          the desert any traits of character, or any habits of
          life, which did not make me prize and value more
          the privileges of civilisation. I had been more
          than a month alone with the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bedouin">Bedouins</name> ; and to
          say nothing of their manners - excluding women
          from all companionship ; dipping their fingers up
          to the knuckles in the same dish ; eating sheep's
          insides ; and sleeping under tents crawling with
          vermin, engendered by their filthy habits—their
          temperance and frugality are from necessity, not
          from choice ; for in their nature they are gluttonous,
          and will eat at any time till they are gorged
          of whatever they can get, and then lie down and
          sleep like brutes. I have sometimes amused
          myself with trying the variety of their appetites,
          and I never knew them refuse anything that could
          be eaten. Their stomach was literally their god,
          and the only chance of doing anything with them
          was by first making to it a grateful offering ; instead
          of scorning luxuries, they would eat sugar
          as boys do sugar-candy ; and I am very sure if
          they could have got pound-cake, they would never
          have eaten their own coarse bread.</quote>

                <p>The same species of patriarchal society prevails,
          as is well known, among the tribes of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America">North
          America</name> ; each tribe being governed by its chief,
          an arrangement which does not prevent it from
          being exposed to all the calamities of a state of
          untutored nature.</p>
                <p>Out of the patriarchal condition of society
          in the East, sprung the system of clanship, long
          prevalent among <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celtic_nations">Celtic nations</name> after they had
          ceased to be nomadic. The word <hi rend="italic">clan</hi> signifies
          family, and is applied to a tribe claiming to be
          descended from one head ; the lineal descendant
          of which is the chief. All the members of
          the clan consider him as a common father and
          protector, to whom they owe an implicit obedience.
          This form of society was brought into
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_Europe">Western Europe</name> by 
          the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celts">Celts</name> in exceedingly early
          times, and disappeared slowly before the encroachments
          of the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nordic_race">Teutonic races</name>. The last of
          its strongholds were the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Highlands">Highlands of Scotland</name>,
          where it was finally abolished by law in 1748, and
          where it is now only known as matter of tradition
          or private feeling. The error of the patriarchal
          system, in point of principle, consists in the fact,
          that it relies on the paternal element in the social
          relations, to the exclusion of the fraternal. It thus
          prevents the development of individual character,
          and the formation of separate households. In
          this respect it is the antithesis of the democratic
          system, which recognises the fraternal to the
          exclusion of the paternal element, and thus, whilst
          stimulating individuality, breaks up the family,
          annihilates authority, silences tradition, and finally
          tends to destroy the historical character of a
          people. The patriarchal system is unprogressive,
          but its relation to barbarism seems accidental ;
          and it cannot be shewn, in principle, to be retrogressive,
          like the systems which, resting on the
          supremacy of numbers, subject the higher to the
          lower social influences. All civilised nations have
          arisen out of a modification of the paternal system,
          but history as yet affords no example of a nation
          which has been held together by means of what is
          called <quote>'fraternity'</quote>. It is only in subordination to
          the paternal that the fraternal bond retains its
          coherence, and becomes operative as a social force.
          It is from the relations of the family that we learn
          our relations as citizens of the state, and the first
          and most important family relation is that of
          parent and child.<pb n="3"/>

                <p>That every human being possesses, as against
          every other human being, a free and inalienable
          right of property in his own person, seems
          an undeniable proposition; and yet it is one
          which even till this day is by no means universally
          recognised. In certain countries, there are individuals - 
          men, women, children - who are not proprietors
          of themselves ; they are bought and sold
           - treated as chattels ; and they possess no civil
          rights whatsoever. A person in such circumstances
          is called a <hi rend="italic">slave</hi> - a word of modern
          origin, supposed to be derived from the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavic_peoples">Slavi</name> or
          <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slavic_peoples">Slavonians</name>, whom 
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_Venice">Venetian merchant-state</name>
          had the cruelty to sell into bondage.</p>
                <p>Slavery, in one form or other, has existed in the

          existed, as we know, among the patriarchs. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Joseph_(Hebrew_Bible)">Joseph</name>

          famine having occurred in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Egypt">Egypt</name>, the people, after
          disposing of all their property in exchange for corn,

                    </bibl>, we learn that a state of bondage,
          which was nearly equivalent to modern slavery,
          was a recognised institution among the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jew">Jews</name>. So
          also did slavery exist among the ancient pagan
          nations - the <name type="people">Phoenicians</name>, the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">Greeks</name>, the <name type="people">Romans</name>.</p>
                <p>Nothing is more certain than that, in all countries
          in ancient times, there was a mass of the
          population in a state of compulsory and perpetual
          servitude. Even in what are termed the freest
          states of antiquity, a large proportion of the people
          were slaves, and possessed no civil rights. At the
          very time when <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Athens">Athens</name> is spoken of as the model
          republic of antiquity, it contained 400,000 slaves,
          and only 20,000 freemen. The practice of slavery
          arose out of the selfishness of barbarism, and did
          not appear to its perpetrators either sinful or unjust.
          Debtors were seized, and, in liquidation of
          petty claims, sold like ordinary property by their
          ruthless creditors. Gamblers, having lost everything,
          staked their persons as a last chance;
          and being unsuccessful, became the bondsmen
          of the winner. Men, for their crimes, are still
          deprived of liberty, but in ancient times they were
          publicly sold into bondage. In cases of famine,
          parents disposed of their children, to relieve their
          own wants. And lastly came war, the scourge of
          mankind, and the fruitful cause of slavery in all
          ancient nations. <quote>'It was a law established from
          time immemorial among the states of antiquity'</quote>,
          says a <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greeks">Greek</name> author, <quote>'to oblige those to undergo
          the severities of servitude whom victory had thrown
          into their hands.'</quote> There was an exception, however,
          in the case of civil war, the prisoners taken
          in which, like all prisoners of war originally, were
          not made slaves, but generally massacred. Besides
          the regular wars between nation and nation, it
          sometimes happened that a vagrant population overran
          an adjoining country, and made the peaceful
          and dispossessed inhabitants their slaves. Thus,
          the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta">Spartans</name> were served by a race of hereditary
          bondsmen, the old inhabitants of the district,
          called <name type="peopole" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots">Helots</name> - a term afterwards used by the
          <name type="people">Romans</name> to designate men in a servile condition.
          The unfortunate <name type="peopole" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helots">Helots</name> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparta">Sparta</name> occasionally
          rose in rebellion against their masters, and attempted
          to gain their liberty ; but these efforts
          were always suppressed with merciless slaughter.</p>
                <p>As Christianity spread over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>, its beneficent
          influences modified slavery ; and during the
          middle ages, the institution took the form of <hi rend="italic">serfdom</hi>.
          The children born on an estate remained
          the <hi rend="italic">thralls</hi> or bondsmen of the proprietor of the
          soil, and were bought and sold along with it, but
          could not legally be removed. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name> and
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>, the greater portion of the peasantry were
          serfs, or, in strict law-phrase, <hi rend="italic">ascripti gleba</hi>: - that
          is, attached to the soil. Their masters retained
          them in perpetual servitude, fed them and cared
          for them, punished them for faults, and in some
          instances put metal collars round their necks, inscribed
          with their names and the names of their
          owners. This species of slavery disappeared in
          the progress of civilisation without direct legislative
          interference ; it being, in reality, a greater
          burden to the land-proprietors than to their servants.
          The institution prevailed in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> till the
          beneficent legislation of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Friedrich_Karl_vom_und_zum_Stein">Stein</name>, and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia">Russia</name> till
          the imperial decree of 1861, which came into full
          operation in 1863.</p>
                <p>As is well known, slavery, in its more rigorous
          forms, is banished from every <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">European</name> nation
          except <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkey">Turkey</name>. In some parts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name>,

          even in many of the southern states of the union
          up to the period of the late war, of which its abolition,
          whether it was the object or not, was certainly
          the result. Whether the inferior races of
          mankind, if such there be, will succeed in availing
          themselves of the liberty which has almost everywhere
          been bestowed on them, is a problem which
          time and experience only can solve. But their
          right to make the experiment cannot be questioned.</p>

                <p>Civil society is constructed on a system of individual

          so far as he is able, to act an independent

          bound to contribute to the maintenance of the
          society of which he forms a part, to give obedience
          to all existing laws, and respect to all properly
          constituted authorities. In consequence of the
          general freedom which every one enjoys, and in
          contradistinction to so-called socialist communities,
          society is said to be founded on the competitive
          principle. No one being interfered with,
          all are left to compete with each other in industrial
          enterprise. This may, and does, have the effect
          of causing a great disparity of condition - men of
          commanding abilities, steadiness, and perseverance
          usually attaining distinction and wealth,
          while those of weaker capacity, or who are less fortunate,
          lapse into poverty. Such is the arrangement
          of nature, and however mysterious or sad it
          may appear to us in individual cases, it is not
          difficult to see that, all things considered, freedom<pb n="4"/>
          of individual enterprise is most advantageous 
          on the whole, and must therefore be 
          carefully preserved as the basis of civil society. 
          By holding out a premium for diligence, it induces mental culture
          and exercise, and affords all an equal opportunity
          of distinguishing themselves. It likewise ought to
          point out the duty of establishing systems of universal
          education, by which we should be assured
          that every one at least possessed the elements of
          instruction and opportunities of self-advancement.
          With respect to those who, from absolute incapacity,
          and other unavoidable circumstances,
          become poor, it is now a generally settled principle
          that they have a claim in law, as well as on
          principles of humanity, for support from their 
          more fortunate fellow-creatures. </p>
                <p>The organisation of civil society, though possessing a 
          general resemblance, differs in a few particulars
          in every country. The chief difference
          consists in the diffusion of privileges. To understand
          distinctions of this nature, it is necessary to
          peruse a course of history, ancient and modern.
          Little can be learned from looking at the present
          aspects of things ; we require to search the records 
          of human progress for the origin of almost every 
          institution, as well as for the philosophy 
          which may be drawn from it.</p>
                <p>Throughout <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>, 
          society has generally arisen
          from similar circumstances. The rudimental germ
          of every state was a handful of adventurers, who,
          by military prowess, made themselves masters of 
          the country. The leading men in such enterprises 
          were chiefs with retainers. The principal chief 
          became king ; the chiefs assumed the character of
          an aristocracy ; and the retainers, with the 
          inhabitants whom they helped to subdue, from being at first serfs, 
          finally attained the rank of freemen. 
          It was long, however, before this latter
          result was achieved. For many ages, the chiefs or
          nobles holding lands by a military tenure from the
          sovereign, formed a feudal aristocracy, by whom
          in reality the whole system of government was
          conducted. The idea of imparting privileges to
          the common people, though recognised by the 
          oldest institutions of the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nordic_race">Teutonic races</name>, was long
          in attaining practical efficacy - not only because
          the nobles needed vassals to execute their will,
          but because the humbler classes had really no
          means of an independent existence. (See <bibl>
                        <title>HISTORY OF THE MIODDLE AGES</title>
                    </bibl>.)</p>
                <p>The original source of the political franchises of
          this country is the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Crown">Crown</name>. From having been
          companions and assistants of the sovereign, the
          principal barons were constantly encroaching on
          his prerogatives. Sometimes the concessions of
          the crown, as those of <bibl>
                        <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magna_Carta">Magna Charta</title>
                    </bibl>, made by
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_of_England">King John</name>, 
          were necessary and desirable; but
          more frequently the nobles were inclined to exact
          so much power in the state as would have
          rendered the king's authority a nonentity. The
          danger of these encroachments caused the monarch
          to seek aid from the commons. With the view, 
          therefore, of raising up a means of protection in this
          quarter, he encouraged the building of cities, 
          to whose inhabitants he gave certain important privileges. 
          The civic corporations, therefore, which in the older 
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">European</name> cities 
          continued to represent the Roman <hi rend="italic">municipia</hi>, 
          must be viewed as the cradle of freedom. From them sprung
          much of the present constitution of society. Relying
          on their privileges, and surrounded by walls,
          these burgher communities defied the nobles, and
          sided with the king. Sometimes the barons sided
          with the burghers, and to no historical individual
          do the commons probably owe so much as to
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_de_Montfort,_6th_Earl_of_Leicester">Simon de Montfort</name>, 
          Earl of Leicester, who, in the
          reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_III_of_England">Henry III.</name> and in the year 1265, ordered
          writs to be issued for the return of two citizens or
          burgesses, to represent every city or borough in
          the kingdom in parliament. From this time, the
          feudal principle declined, serfs were gradually
          emancipated, and ultimately every man was
          declared to be equal in the eye of the law.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to be thus particular, for a notion
          prevails among the humbler classes that they
          have been deprived of rights enjoyed by their
          ancestors. History most explicitly shews that,
          in early times, the peasantry and operative bodies
          possessed no privileges whatever. <bibl>
                        <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magna_Carta">Magna Charta</title>

          does not so much as mention them. Society, in
          fact, has been quite a progressive development.
          Little by little, privileges have been widened in
          behalf of the citizen class, though by no means
          always by their own efforts, and if they continue
          to deserve them, there can be no doubt that they
          will go on widening as circumstances render it
          desirable. Doubtless, it may be alleged that all
          men are equal, and deserve to possess equal
          privileges ; but to this assertion, contradicted as
          it is by the most ordinary observation and the
          most elementary common-sense, there are, as to
          all other false principles, practical as well as
          theoretical objections, which will always defeat
          the objects of those by whom it is made. Its
          realisation as the basis of society, would demand,
          as we have seen, a reversal of the laws of nature,
          and may safely be pronounced to be impossible,
          however great may be the confusion produced by
          such attempts to realise it as those which we have
          so often witnessed in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>. Equality before
          the law - that is, the equal right of every man to be
          valued at what he is worth, not in his own eyes,
          but in the eyes of his fellow-citizens - is the only
          form of equality that is either just or attainable.
          If a man is dissatisfied with his position, it is he
          himself that must improve it by his own industry,
          intelligence, and frugality. The law cannot make
          him better than he makes himself. These are
          assertions apart from all party creeds, which lie at
          the root of political philosophy, and which the
          simplest citizen may substantiate by his own
          experience and reflection. Meanwhile, we desire
          to fix attention on the vast impulse given to
          civilisation by the erection of cities.</p>

                <p>It is to cities or large towns that mankind
          chiefly owe the blessings of civilisation and the
          valuable institutions which they now enjoy. With
          cities, everything that is great and glorious - arts,
          science, literature - began, and after beginning,
          was duly fostered. Through their means, civil
          society began to assume a more systematic character. 
          The division of labour, the refinements of
          social intercourse, the development of laws caused
          by the conflicting interests of many people living
          closely together, the idea of equality before the
          law, the growth of patriotism, springing from the
          sense of advantages enjoyed, and the exertions
          necessary to maintain them, were the salutary
          consequences of the establishment of cities.<pb n="5"/>

          oldest city of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece">Greece</name>. Several confederations of
          cities existed in the ancient world; for instance,
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phoenicia">Phoenician</name>, consisting of the cities of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tyre,_Lebanon">Tyre</name>,

                <p>Franks (496 A.D.).
          The <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germans">Germans</name>, accustomed to a wild, rambling
          life, did not shew any disposition to live in cities,
          until <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</name> laboured to collect them together
          in settled abodes, from his desire to civilise
          them. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henry_the_Fowler">Henry I</name>. distinguished himself particularly
          in this way, and on this account has been called
          by some Henry the City-builder, He gave the
          cities great privileges, in order to induce his subjects
          to live in them, and thus laid the foundation
          of that power which at a future period contributed
          most to break down the feudal system. In many
          cities, imperial castles were erected to protect the
          inhabitants; and the insupportable oppressions
          and even cruelties exercised by the feudal lords
          upon their peasants, or by the wandering knights
          and robbers, drove many people into the cities.
          The attacks of the neighbouring lords gave firmness
          to their union, and compelled them to cultivate
          their resources. Commerce, and the various
          arts and trades, were soon cultivated within their
          walls, and their wealth and respectability increased.</p>
                <p>One of the most important remnants of the
          great fabric of ancient civilisation was the cities
          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name>. What the world would have become
          without them is not to be calculated. In spite of
          their bloody contests with each other, and the
          vices to which these gave rise, they must be considered
          as having lighted the torch of modern
          civilisation. It was not the monarchies, it was
          not the courts of the great princes, it was the
          cities of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Italy">Northern Italy</name> which opened the way
          for the progress of improvement; and the petty
          princes of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name> caught from them the spirit which
          prompted their efforts to promote it. Under the
          reign of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conrad_III_of_Germany">Conrad III</name>. (1138-52), the cities of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombardy">Lombardy</name>, and particularly <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MILAN">Milan</name>, which stood at
          their head, had acquired a high degree of wealth
          and power, and had formed themselves into a
          confederation. The struggles between the emperors
          and these cities form one of the most important
          portions of the history of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">German
            Empire</name> and of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name>. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Frederick I.</name> in vain
          demohshed the powerful city of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MILAN">Milan</name>. It was
          soon rebuilt,; and the cities of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lombardy">Lombardy</name>, in
          alliance with the pope, obliged the emperor to
          conclude with them a very disadvantageous peace
          at <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Konstanz">Constance</name>. Two other confederations of cities,
          highly important, were formed during the interregnum
          of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">German Empire</name>, between 1256 and
          1272. One of them was the powerful league of
          the Hanse towns; the other, the confederacy of
          the High-German and Rhenish cities from the
          foot of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ALPS">Alps</name> to the mouth of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Main">Maine</name>, established,
          by Walpode of <name type="place">Mentz</name>, in 1255. A similar
          confederacy, and a very important one, was that
          of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swabia">Swabian</name> cities, instituted in 1488, to repel
          the outrages of the feudal lords and knights.
          By degrees, great cities arose in the different
          countries ; and wealth, industry, knowledge, and
          equal laws spread from them through <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>.</p>
                <p>Much has been said and wiitten on the immorality
          of large towns and cities, and the fact cannot
          be denied ; but immorality is not confined to them.
          The petty vices of small places, though less glaring,
          are perhaps equally injurious, making up in constant
          repetition for their comparatively less degree
          of noxiousness. It is much more difficult, moreover,
          to preserve one of the most important
          possessions— independence of character—in a
          small place than in a large one. The cry against
          the immorality of large cities should not make us
          forget the many great and admirable things which
          mankind have been enabled to perform by means
          of the collected strength of talents and resources
          combined in large cities, and their influence in
          forming the character of great men, who could
          not have acquired elsewhere their variety of
          accomplishments, and the well-proportioned cultivation
          of their various faculties. But though such
          considerations may be advanced to palliate, if not
          to controvert the charge of immorality against
          great cities, it is impossible to deny their exceeding
          unhealthiness. In the supplement to
          the monthly and quarterly returns for 1872, the
          Registrar-general says (p. 9) :
          <quote>'The several town
            and rural districts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name> shewed the usual
          striking differences in their mortality during the
          year just closed. Thus, for every 10,000 persons
          in each of the five new groups of districts into
          which <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name> is divided, there occurred 276
          deaths in the principal towns, 251 deaths in the
          large towns, 215 in the small towns, 172 deaths in
          the mainland rural districts, but only 157 deaths
          in the insular rural districts. These facts might be
          otherwise expressed by saying, that there occurred
          one death out of every 36 persons in the principal
          towns, one death in every 40 persons in the large
          towns, one death in every 46 persons in the small
          towns, one death in every 58 persons in the
          mainland rural districts, but only one death in
          every 64 persons in the insular rural districts.'</quote> It
          is true that the birth-rate compensates the deathrate,
          the result being the production of a more and
          more numerous population, which goes on continually
          degenerating in physical if not also in
          moral and intellectual qualities. Yet, notwithstanding
          these deplorable facts, which are continually
          published on the highest authority, the
          country populations continue to pour into the
          towns both in this and, though in a minor degree,
          in other countries. The only remedy seems to
          consist in attempting, as far as possible, to
          counteract the now established law, that <hi rend="italic">the deathrate
          rises with the density of the population</hi>, by
          spreading the cities over the country. It is a
          remedy which admits of extensive application,
          and which, there seems reason to hope, is now<pb n="6"/>beginning to be understood. The last census
          exhibits a very marked tendency in the poor
          population of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> to migrate from the centre
          to the circumference, and the same tendency is
          perceptible in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</name> and in many provincial
          towns.</p>
                <p>Capitals, in the modern meaning of the word,
          can hardly be said to have existed in ancient
          times ; at least they were then only the seat of
          the sovereign, but not the centre of all the national
          activity, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome">Rome</name> only perhaps excepted ; but this
          city was for a very long time the state itself, and,
          at a later period, the tyrant of the whole empire,
          rather than the head of a well-organised body.
          In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, there existed, indeed, in ancient times,
          capitals of very large empires ; but they are not
          to be compared to the capitals of large modern
          empires, since the channels of communication and
          intercourse had not then reached that degree of
          perfection which enables them in our days to
          bring into close connection all parts of a country.
          Each province was, therefore, left much more to
          itself. It would be difficult to determine whether
          the good or evil consequences of large capitals in
          modern times are greater, and such an examination
          would far exceed our limits ; otherwise, it
          would be very easy to point out, in every department
          of civilisation, in science, social intercourse,
          arts, &amp;c. both salutary and pernicious effects resulting
          from the influence of capitals. It seems
          to us a matter of little doubt that it must be
          regarded as disadvantageous to any country if the
          capital ceases to be the concentration of the skill,
          genius, and strength of a nation, for the benefit of
          the whole ; but by a disproportionate superiority it
          destroys the importance of the rest of the country,
          as we find to be the case with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, which, as has
          been often observed, contains <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>,
          the state of things is quite the reverse. A multitude
          of university towns are scattered all over the
          country, and there is no city which may boast
          of being the point of intellectual concentration or
          refinement. The consequences have been very
          advantageous to science and literature. In politics,
          this want of a central point, as regards <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Northern_Germany">Northern
          Germany</name>, has been remedied by the adoption of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin">Berlin</name> as the seat of the empire. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name> never
          exercised that degree of influence over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>
          which <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> has 
          over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> ; one reason of which
          may be, that the institutions for the diffusion of
          knowledge are not seated in the metropolis. The
          system of concentration has, there is little doubt,
          been carried to an extreme in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name> - the best of
          everything having been collected in the capitals,
          and the provinces having been almost stripped of
          pictures, libraries, &amp;c. In many countries, this
          fault is acknowledged, and a return to a more
          equitable system is perceptible. The injury done
          to the provincial towns in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name> by the concentration
          of institutions of various kinds in the
          capital, is likely soon to be greatly modified, by
          the establishment of railways and other improved
          means of communication, which will tend to give
          all parts of the kingdom an equality of advantages.</p>

                <head>FORMS OF GOVERNMENT.</head>
                <p>The patriarchal and clanship systems of government
          have been already adverted to. With these,
          mankind may be said to have made a beginning.
          The next step in progress seems to have been
          a government by kings, which is only a more
          developed form of the patriarchal system, the
          kingly being a centralisation of the patriarchal or
          feudal power. In some ancient nations, a government
          of priests superseded that of kings. This
          species of government was called a <hi rend="italic">theocracy</hi>,
          from <hi rend="italic">Theos</hi>, the <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greek_language">Greek</name> word for <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God">God</name> ; it being
          represented by the priests that they ruled according
          to the will of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God">God</name> directly revealed to them.
          Although to a great extent based on superstitious
          fears, priestly governments were an advance on
          governments of mere fighting-men.</p>
                <p>Out of these early systems of government, in
          conjunction with the experience of ages, all existing
          governments have sprung. Although, however,
          there is nothing of which mankind has had<pb n="7"/>so extensive or so varied an experience, the only
          fact which can be said to have been ascertained
          is the impossibility of devising any one form of
          government which shall be of universal application.
          Much has been written on the subject of
          what is called a <q>perfect government</q>; but the
          result of all inquiry seems to be, that nothing is
          permanent except general principles or natural
          laws. Those, therefore, who contend for any particular
          model of government, without a due regard
          to circumstances, only pursue a delusive fancy.
          No species of government that could be devised
          will apply universally. The only practical rule
          of any value is, that every nation should possess
          a government in harmony with its state of civilisation,
          and the tastes and habits of the more enlightened
          portions of the community, to which the
          tastes and habits of the less enlightened may be
          expected gradually to conform.</p>
                <p>As there is no such thing as a universally suitable
          form of government, so the form of government of
          any particular country requires to vary, and alter
          its character in adaptation to the advance or retrogression
          of society. In proportion as the people
          are ignorant and turbulently disposed, the government
          requires to be strong and arbitrary; and
          according as the people are enlightened, and
          disposed to live peacefully, the government may
          be mild and liberal. The ambition of kings
          and emperors, no doubt, is observed to sustain
          an arbitrary rule in circumstances where greater
          freedom should be accorded ; but, as a general
          principle, it is evident that arbitrary military
          governments can only exist where the people at
          large are incapable of guiding and enjoying free
          institutions ; or, in other words, where they are
          required. Sooner or later, the government of
          every country must bring itself into harmony with
          the society it rules, otherwise it will be overthrown.
          The cause for this is evident. Every government
          acts upon its subjects by means of themselves ; it
          employs its subjects to keep its subjects in obedience.
          The consequence of this is, that in every
          country, and in all ages, the most seemingly
          despotic government is kept in check by the
          opinions of its subjects. No doubt, means, in some
          cases, are adopted to restrain the operation of public
          opinion ; but, on the whole, the feelings and
          prejudices of the parties governed must ultimately
          be consulted.</p>
                <p>Government being thus compelled to a certain
          degree to make justice and the good of the community
          its aim, it is important that the community
          be so enlightened and organised in opinions and
          wishes that it will easily and unobtrusively act on
          the controlling authority. There is another object
          to be gained by thus enlightening and organising
          the people, besides that of making them an
          efficient check upon government when it goes
          wrong ; it is only by enlightening and organising
          the people that they can be rendered capable of
          lending due force to the operations of government,
          when these are what they ought to be. An unenlightened
          people is quite as likely to entertain
          mistaken notions of what is for its good as correct
          ones ; it is quite as likely to oppose government
          when it tries to do what is right, and to support it
          when it tries to do what is wrong, as the reverse.
          The <name type="institution">British government</name> was in the right when,
          about the year 1780, it repealed some of the worst
          enactments against the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">Catholics</name> ; but the people
          were so far from heartily approving of this act of
          justice, that <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_George_Gordon">Lord George Gordon</name>'s riots in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London">London</name>,
          and the burning of Catholic chapels in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</name>,
          had nearly frightened government out of
          its good intentions.</p>
                <p>The first step, then, in making such arrangements
          as are necessary for keeping government in
          its just and useful line of action, is to enlighten
          the people. There goes more towards <hi rend="italic">enlightening</hi>
          the people than merely giving them school
          instruction, however thorough and extensive that
          may be. The people require to take every opportunity
          of acquiring knowledge, of extending their
          stock of ideas, of elevating their tastes, and of
          cultivating a brotherly benevolence. The great
          retarding influence in every nation has been less
          the arbitrary will of government, than the mass of
          voluntary ignorance which has nestled in the bosom
          of society. Nor is ignorance the only retarding
          influence. Mutual jealousy between the various
          classes into which society, by the action of natural
          laws, inevitably divides itself, may render even a
          comparatively well-instructed people totally incapable
          of self-government In point of intelligence,
          the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">French</name> have certainly always held a good
          place amongst the nations of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>. But the
          selfishness, vanity, and exclusiveness of the higher
          classes in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> had this effect up to the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">period
          of the Revolution</name>, and vices of a character closely
          analogous on the part of the lower orders, have had
          the same effect ever since. The whole nation
          seems now to have become incapable either of
          governing or obeying ; and, as has been wittily
          said, <q>everything is impossible in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>.</q> A consideration
          of this circumstance ought to temper
          observations on the strictly monarchical and aristocratic
          forms of government, and on the characters
          of those by whom they are attempted to be
          administered.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Aristocracies.</head>
                <p>An <hi rend="italic">aristocracy</hi>, a class of privileged persons, has
          its origin in the circumstance that greater skill,
          enterprise, intelligence, and perseverance, at first
          threw a comparatively great amount of wealth and
          power into the hands of a few families. That the
          management of that wealth, and the exercise of
          the power and influence which it conferred, were
          occupations calculated to give a greater practical
          development to the faculties of their descendants,
          than the routine drudgery of those who earned
          their daily food by their daily labour, is obvious,
          and these inherited qualities, or qualities at anyrate
          which were strengthened by the advantages
          of inherited position, were further strengthened by
          direct education. We have no desire to palliate
          the evils of aristocratic government, which more,
          perhaps, than even democratic government, tends
          to degenerate into government for the benefit of a
          class. But we must not, therefore, be blind to the
          fact, that aristocratic government is one of the
          stages through which all societies must pass on
          their way to something better ; or that it has roots
          in nature, and consequent uses, which will always
          preserve it as an element, even in the highest
          forms of government to which mankind can attain.
          Inequality of civilisation, which gave rise to aristocratic
          power and influence, exists in many different
          forms and modifications. Even in our own
          country, an uncivilised class is found—that unfortunate
          class which supplies the precarious demand<pb n="8"/>for the lowest kinds of unskilled labour, and
          which fills our police-offices and courts of justice
          with the greater number of the victims to the
          security of society. Nor is there reason to believe
          that any future elevation of this class will ever
          bring it up to the condition of virtue and intelligence
          to which the higher class will then have
          attained. It is not of the lowest class alone that
          progress may be hoped ; and if all classes progress,
          which is the only hypothesis on which the
          progress of the community as a whole is possible,
          the fact will afford no guarantee even for the
          diminution of the distance which at present divides
          them. To check the progress of the highest class
          would be to check civilisation itself, and if all
          classes progress <hi rend="italic">equally</hi>, their <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> positions
          will remain unchanged. But as one element of
          this, progress itself must consist in a better understanding
          of their relations to each other—that is,
          their respective rights and duties ; the distinctions
          between classes will cease to be felt either as a
          source of pride on the one hand, or of humiliation
          on the other. Distinctions which are hedged in by
          impassable barriers are real impediments to progress,
          and justly excite indignation on the part of
          those whom they restrain. But these are not
          classes, but castes, which have always been
          repudiated by the constitution of this country,
          and even socially have never received any consistent
          recognition. So long as the son of a
          peasant may marry the daughter of a peer, and
          end by being a peer himself, whose son may
          marry the daughter of a queen, there is nothing
          really to complain of; and such is, and always has
          been, the relation of classes in this country. It is
          only want of mutual consideration on the part of
          individuals that sets them against each other, and
          the remedy demands no revolution.</p>
                <p>The object of what are called constitutional
          governments is not to abolish classes, but to
          secure equally the privileges of all classes, by a
          definite arrangement, in place of leaving them to
          assert themselves on each occasion as it occurs.
          But no constitution will ever supersede the necessity
          for the exercise of citizen virtues on the part
          of the governed. Unless those to whom the
          function of government is intrusted are selected
          on the ground of fitness to represent the interests
          of the community as a whole, and not simply the
          interests of a particular class ; and unless those
          who lead are somewhat in advance of those whom
          they lead, there can be no social progress, and
          there is not likely long to be even social stability.</p>

                <head>Despotisms.</head>
                <p>Out of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>, the greater proportion of the
          governments throughout the world are of the
          character of <hi rend="italic">despotisms</hi>. Of the multifarious despotisms
          which exist among barbarous nations, it
          is here needless to say anything ; for the question
          of form of government only becomes interesting
          when applied to a wholly or partially civilised
          people. There is scarcely any country in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>
          which can now be said to be governed despotically,
          the reforms of the present emperor having
          removed even <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia">Russia</name> from that category. But
          when violent democratic outbreaks occur, despotic
          government usually appears as a temporary
          remedy. Of this character were the despotisms
          of the two <name type="person">Napoleons</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>.</p>
                <p>Though technically protected by codes of law,
          the subjects of despotisms are, in a great measure,
          at the will of a supreme authority, which has no
          check but public opinion. To insure obedience,
          a large military force is maintained, the press is
          under a censorship, the police act as spies on
          private actions, and travelling is regulated by passports.
          A leading feature of such despotisms is,
          that the whole system of government is <hi rend="italic">centralised</hi>
          in a ministry in the capital of the empire, whence
          orders issue to all inferior authorities. By this
          means, the people, who are kept in order like
          children, do not acquire habits of self-government,
          and, except when exposed to some peculiar pressure,
          remain tranquil under a variety of restrictions.
          Offensive as such a system may appear to
          be, it often possesses qualities which for the time
          being recommend it to support : peace is thoroughly
          maintained ; life and property are protected
          ; the people, as objects of solicitude, are
          provided with public gardens and promenades,
          and allowed may other indulgences at the cost
          of the country ; probably they are educated in
          the only possible way for the discharge of citizen
          duties, which, for the present, they are incapable
          of performing. Moreover, by bearing down factious
          opposition, and exerting a control over
          selfish private interests, a despotism is able to
          execute great and beneficial public works which
          seem to be beyond the reach of constitutional
          legislation ; and it therefore commands a degree
          of respect which persons beyond its sphere do
          not readily appreciate. When it appears as a
          substitute for anarchy, the name technically
          applied to conditions of society in which there is
          no established government at all, and where the
          people are the prey of rival despots, who have
          sprung from their own ranks, the value of a single
          absolute ruler is still more obvious.</p>

                <p>
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name> abounds in constitutional monarchies -
          governments, that is to say, in which the king, or
          other chief ruler, is restricted in his powers by
          estates composed of representatives of, or delegates
          from different orders of the people. We should
          consider it quite useless to present detailed explanations
          of these constitutions. Those of them
          which are of modern origin, like that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium">Belgium</name>
          and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name>, are more or less imitations of our own,

          defined, and the reigning monarch can occasionally

          afford extensive and substantial guarantees for
          popular rights. From the earliest period known
          to history, the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germanic_peoples">Germanic races</name> have possessed
          popular along-side of aristocratic and monarchical
          institutions. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tacitus">Tacitus</name> mentions their existence
          amongst the tribes by whom the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</name>
          was overthrown, and they extended even to the
          island of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iceland">Iceland</name>. It is in these institutions that
          we must look for the origin of our own constitution
          of king, lords, and commons. This arrangement, in
          its general conception, would seem to be inseparable
          from the genius of the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nordic_race">Teutonic races</name> ; it has
          rarely been successfully imitated by the other
          races of mankind. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norway">Norway</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweden">Sweden</name>, in
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark">Denmark</name>, and in most parts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>, these old
          constitutions, which varied greatly in details, but
          rested always on some sort of widely extended,
          though graduated suffrage, and were frequently<pb n="9"/>very complicated, have since 1848 been greatly
          modified in the democratic direction, and made
          considerably more to resemble that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>, in its later form.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">British Constitution</hi>. - In the constitution of
          this country we possess the most perfect example
          of a developed constitution of the Teutonic or
          Germanic type. The legislature, as is well known,
          consists of an hereditary sovereign (king or queen,
          as the case may be), an hereditary <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords">House of Lords</name>,
          and an elected <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Commons">House of Commons</name>. Previous to
          the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glorious_Revolution">Revolution of 1688</name>, the sovereigns had assumed
          the prerogative of ruling by a divine, or inherent
          and indestructible, right. This unfortunate
          innovation on the old Teutonic or Germanic order
          of ideas was carried to so great an extent by the
          Stuart kings as to produce a violent reaction.
          This tendency resulted in the temporary establishment
          of the Commonwealth, or Republic, which,
          like most other republics in great countries,
          speedily degenerated into a despotism, in the
          person of the so-called Protector, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</name>.
          Another reaction, ending in the restoration
          of the exiled royal family, was the consequence;
          and as they were no wiser after their return than
          before their banishment, we seemed at this period
          of our history in great danger of falling into the
          unsettled state of political life from which <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>
          and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name> have suffered and still suffer so much.
          The ultimate revolution, however, accomplished by
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/William_III_of_England">William III.</name> a <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people">Dutchman</name> by birth, but the nephew
          and son-in-law of the exiled monarch, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_II_of_England">James II.</name>
          was completely successful ; partly, in consequence
          of the wisdom and moderation of that prince ; but
          mainly because, on the whole, the Settlement, as
          it was called, was a return to the ancient constitution
          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>. According to the Revolution
          Settlement, the sovereign rules by a kind of
          bargain with the people. At his accession and
          coronation, he takes an oath to rule in terms of
          certain constitutional obligations ; and by employing
          a ministry on whom the sole responsibility
          rests, he is presumed to take no part in public
          affairs, and is not held answerable for consequences.
          This is not merely a device for limiting
          the royal prerogative, but a remnant of the
          old mythical belief in royal infallibility, embodied
          in the phrase, <q>The king can do no wrong.</q> As
          the ministry are amenable to the votes of the
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palace_of_Westminster">Houses of Parliament</name>, they require to act in
          harmony with the wishes of the nation.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">Parliament</hi> is the term used to express the
          collective body of King, Lords, and Commons.
          The king, however, appears only by his ministers,
          and usually appends his signature to bills separately
          from the parliamentary business. By being
          composed of hereditary legislators, who are removed
          beyond the influence of popular clamour,
          the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords">House of Lords</name> is understood to impart a
          certain stability to the constitution. Between 1688
          and the present time, two constitutional changes
          of considerable importance have been made, the
          one in 1832, the other in 1867-8. By the first,
          the Reform Bill of 1832, the English county constituencies
          were increased from 52 to 82; but in
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland">Ireland</name> the county representation
          remained as before. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, 56 boroughs,
          containing a population, in 1831, of less than 2000
          each, and returning together 111 members, were
          totally disfranchised ; while 30 other boroughs,
          containing a population of less than 4000 each,
          were reduced to sending one member to parliament,
          instead of two. These boroughs, for the
          most part, had fallen off either in relative or in
          absolute population. On the other hand, 22 new
          boroughs, containing 25,000 inhabitants, received
          the privilege of returning two members ; and 20
          other new boroughs, containing each 12,000 inhabitants
          and upwards, that of returning one member.
          In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>, the town members were increased
          from 15 to 23, so that the number of representatives
          became 8 more than the number assigned
          to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name> at the Union. As regards electoral
          qualifications, which were greatly reduced, the
          following were the provisions : In counties, an
          elector must be possessed of property in perpetuity
          or liferent to the value of £10 yearly, or
          lands held at a yearly rent of £50. In cities or
          boroughs, he must be proprietor of a house or
          shop valued, along with the land attached to it,
          at £10 yearly and upwards ; or must occupy
          premises for which he pays a rent of at least £10
          per annum.</p>
                <p>In 1867-8 the changes were scarcely less
          momentous, though the measure was not called
          for by the same amount of popular excitement, or
          hailed with the same enthusiasm as the act of
          1832. The most important provisions of this act, as regards
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, are the clauses which establish
          household suffrage in boroughs, and the occupation
          franchise in counties.

                <p>The Reform Acts for <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland">Ireland</name>,
          passed in the session of 1868, differ in some important
          respects from that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>. By the
          Scotch act, the borough franchise is conferred
          upon every male person of full age, and subject
          to no legal incapacity, who has been for twelve
          months an occupier, as owner or tenant, of any
          dwelling, unless at any time during that period
          he shall have been exempted from poor-rates, or
          shall have been in receipt of parochial relief within
          twelve months. The lodger franchise, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>,
          permits any lodger to vote who has occupied in
          the same borough separately, and as sole tenant,
          for twelve months, a lodging of the clear annual
          value, if let unfurnished, of £10 or upwards, and
          has claimed registration. In Scotch counties, the
          ownership franchise is £5, clear of any deduction
          in the shape of burdens, with a residential qualification
          of not less than six months. The Reform
          Act for <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland">Ireland</name> made no alteration in the county
          franchise, but reduced that of boroughs to a £4
          rating occupation, qualified as in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>. It is
          now (1874) proposed to assimilate the county to
          the borough qualification by adopting household
          suffrage. With reference to these enactments, it
          is worthy of remark that, whilst a property qualification
          is to a certain extent retained as the test
          of fitness for the exercise of the franchise, not
          only is there no distinction of less and more,
          but owners and tenants are actually put on the
          same footing. The provision is intended to
          gratify the poorer classes, but it really inflicts a
          very great injury on the more industrious portion
          of the poorer classes themselves, by leaving the
          man who, by his honest exertions and praiseworthy
          self-denial, has succeeded in saving as
          much as to purchase his house or tenement, in
          precisely the same position as his idle and drunken
          neighbour, who has continued to be a tenant. It
          thus holds out no encouragement to industry and
          frugality, and were it to cease to be counteracted
          by the historical influences which are still so
          powerful in this country, it might land us in a
          revolution similar to that which has proved so
          disastrous to continental nations. That the
          sovereignty rests ultimately with the people, has
          always been the principle of our own, as of every
          free constitution; but it is a novelty in English
          politics, and a very unhappy one, borrowed from
          other countries, which identifies the people with
          the mere numerical majority, irrespective of
          means, as a guarantee for industry and frugality,
          or of education, as a guarantee for intelligence.</p>
                <p>No monarchy on the face of the earth interferes
          so little with private conduct as that of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>. Under its administration, the
          following important conditions are secured:
          Liberty of speech within constitutional limits ; a
          similar liberty of the press in all its departments ;
          liberty of personal locomotion, no passports being
          required ; liberty of carrying on almost every
          branch of trade without inquiry or license ; liberty
          of meeting in masses to be instructed by lectures
          on political or other subjects ; liberty of meeting
          to discuss any political topic, general or local ;
          liberty of presenting petitions to parliament, and
          memorials to the crown ; religious toleration, and
          liberty for the performance of all forms of worship
          ; liberty of setting up schools to instruct
          pupils in any branch of learning ; protection from
          the law to life and property, without respect of
          person; privilege of trial by jury, and of forcing
          on a trial for any alleged offence ; privilege of
          being held as innocent till proved to be guilty;
          incorruptibility of judges, these being no way
          exposed to intimidation either from power or
          popular prejudice, an advantage which is lost the
          moment that they are made elective, as in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Americas">America</name>,
          where the taking of bribes has recently prevailed
          to so fearful an extent as to render the successful
          litigant too often the litigant who has the longest
          purse. To these great bulwarks of civil liberty
          may be added the absence of military conscription
          ; the non-existence of fortified or walled
          towns ; the promptitude with which riotous proceedings
          are quashed and the peace preserved ;
          and the absence of any restriction to prevent the
          most humble individual from rising to the highest
          rank and consideration. The drawbacks on all
          these advantages may be comprised in the following
          circumstances : The existence of a set of laws
          so complex as to be unintelligible, and so expensive
          in administration, that legal redress, so far
          as private interests are concerned, is almost
          beyond the reach of the lower classes ; the too
          prevailing treatment of all great questions in
          parliament with reference to classes instead of to
          the whole people ; and, till recently, the absence
          of a thoroughly national system of education,
          which might in time elevate the minds and morals
          of the people, and altogether produce a more
          wholesome social condition. Fortunately, these
          circumstances are all of a nature which admit of
          amendment ; and they will, as a matter of course,
          be amended, as public opinion, enlightened by
          knowledge, is brought to bear upon them.</p>

                <head>Republics.</head>
                <p>A republic or commonwealth is a form of government
          in which the people, or at least a large portion
          of them, are acknowledgedly the source of power,
          and have the direct appointment of the officers, not
          only of the legislature but of the executive. There
          are few of this class of governments in existence.
          The oldest republics in the world are those of the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland">Swiss</name> cantons ; each of which is a territory of
          generally a few square miles in size, and inhabited<pb n="11"/>by a few thousands of people, chiefly engaged in
          husbandry. In these cantons there are no great
          properties, and though there are many ancient
          families which enjoy much consideration, and to
          whose members, in the smaller cantons, magisterial
          offices are generally intrusted by a sort of
          tradition, there are none which in wealth are equivalent
          to the richer <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people">English</name> landed gentry. There
          are some wealthy and intelligent merchants in the
          large towns ; but the bulk of the population are
          a hard-toiling race of small farmers, who, in means
          and education, are little above a condition of mediocrity.
          The legislative and executive functions
          are conducted in accordance with this state of
          things ; and it is no doubt owing to the smallness
          of its territory, and the comparative equality in
          wealth and intelligence of its inhabitants, that
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland">Switzerland</name> has so long preserved its republican
          institutions. The constitutions of the separate
          cantons are divided into two classes, <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi>
          democracies and <hi rend="italic">representative</hi> democracies. In
          the former, the chief power belongs to the assembly
          of the whole adult male population, which meets
          once a year to pass laws and regulate the revenue
          and expenditure of the canton. Seven of the cantons
          have constitutions of this purely democratic
          kind. In the others, the people elect a council, to
          which they delegate their powers. These republics,
          centring in a general diet or congress, are greatly
          under the influence of the greater nations which surround
          them, by which, indeed, they are in a great
          measure tolerated only from mutual jealousy, and
          because the country is in some places almost
          inaccessible to hostile invasion. Since 1848, the
          power of the central element has been increased,
          and from being a league of semi-independent
          states, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland">Switzerland</name> has become a United Confederacy.
          The present constitution vests the
          supreme legislative and executive authority in a
          parliament of two chambers, a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swiss_Council_of_States">State Council</name> and
          a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Council_of_Switzerland">National Council</name>. The first is composed of fortyfour
          members, chosen by the twenty-two cantons,
          two for each. The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Council_of_Switzerland">National Council</name> consists of
          about one hundred and thirty representatives of the
          <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swiss_(nationality)">Swiss people</name>, chosen in direct election, at the rate
          of one deputy to every 20,000 souls. Both chambers
          united constitute the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Assembly_of_Switzerland">Federal Assembly</name>, and
          represent the supreme government of the republic.
          The chief executive authority is deputed to a
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swiss_Federal_Council">Federal Council</name>, consisting of seven members,
          elected for three years by the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Assembly_of_Switzerland">Federal Assembly</name>.</p>
                <p>On the continent of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Americas">America</name>, various republics
          have been founded on the wreck of the colonial
          institutions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>. The principal is the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States of North America</name>, dating from
          1776. The legislature and executive bear traces
          of their English origin ; the main difference being
          an elective President as chief magistrate, instead
          of an hereditary sovereign, and the appointment
          of judicial and other functionaries by the people,
          instead of by the crown. The country is not one,
          but an aggregation of republics ; each state being
          independent of the others as respects internal
          management. The power of legislation for the
          States, in their united character, is vested in a
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House of Representatives</name> and a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate">Senate</name>, jointly
          forming a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress">Congress</name>. The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House of Representatives</name>
          is composed of members chosen every second
          year by the vote of all male citizens over the age
          of twenty-one, of the several states of the Union.
          Representatives are apportioned among the several
          states of the Union according to their respective
          numbers, which are determined by the census
          taken every ten years. A law passed in April
          1872, after the results of the ninth census of the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name>, taken in June 1870, had been
          ascertained, provides that from and after March
          3, 1873, the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House of Representatives</name> shall consist
          of two hundred and eighty-three members. When
          new states are admitted to the Union, it is provided
          that their representatives shall be additional
          to the number of two hundred and eighty-three,
          which otherwise shall be the limit till the tenth
          census. No person is eligible as representative who
          has not completed his twenty-fifth year, and been
          seven years a citizen of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name>, and
          who is not, when elected, resident in the state for
          which he is chosen. In addition to the representatives
          from the States, the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House</name> admits
          a 'delegate' from each organised territory,
          with right to debate on subjects in which his
          territory is interested, but not to vote. Delegates
          are chosen in the same way as representatives,
          except in the territory of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wyoming">Wyoming</name>, where the
          franchise is accorded to women. The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate">Senate</name> of
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name> is composed of two senators
          from each state, elected by the legislature thereof
          for six years. One-third of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate">Senate</name> goes out,
          and is replaced by a new election every two
          years. A senator must be thirty years of age,
          nine years a citizen, and resident in the state for
          which he is elected. All members, both of the
          general and state legislatures, are paid for their
          services.</p>
                <p>The President is elected by the whole people,
          for a term of four years : at the close of that period,
          he may be re-elected ; and, with two or three exceptions,
          all the presidents of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name>
          have been re-elected for a second term. Each
          state appoints a number of electors, equal to the
          whole number of senators and representatives to
          which the state may be entitled in the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Congress">Congress</name> ;
          but no senator or representative, or person holding
          an office of trust or profit under the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name>,
          can be appointed an elector. These electors meet
          in their respective states, to vote for President and
          Vice-president, one of whom at least shall not be
          an inhabitant of the state. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delaware">Delaware</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Carolina">South
          Carolina</name>, and <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, the legislature chooses
          the electors ; in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maine">Maine</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maryland">Maryland</name>, electors are
          chosen by the people voting for one or more in
          each district ; in all the rest of the states, they are
          chosen by a <q>general ticket'</q>, upon which the whole
          of the electors vote. The electors transmit sealed
          lists of all the persons voted for as President, and
          all those voted for as Vice-president, to the President
          of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate">Senate</name>, who opens the lists, and counts
          the votes, in the presence of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate">Senate</name> and <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House of Representatives</name>. If for the person having the
          greatest number of votes for President, a majority
          of the whole electors have voted, he is declared
          President ; if fewer, the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_House_of_Representatives">House of Representatives</name>
          elects by ballot one of the three who stand highest
          on the list. If for the person having the most
          votes for Vice-president, a majority of all the
          electors have voted, he is declared Vice-president;
          if not, the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States_Senate">Senate</name> names one of the two who stand
          highest on the list The President and Vicepresident
          must be natural-born citizens, thirtyfive
          years of age, and fourteen years resident
          within the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name>. The principle of electing
          representatives to the state legislatures is<pb n="12"/>almost that of universal suffrage ; in most instances,
          every male citizen above twenty-one years
          of age who has resided a year in the state is an
          elector.</p>
                <p>With an immensely large unoccupied territory,
          and general thinness of population, it is impossible
          to draw any just inference as to the stability of
          this still comparatively new and untried republican
          government. It has exhibited many forms of corruption,
          and the most respectable citizens have,
          for the most part, entirely withdrawn from political
          life. For the present, however, it is perhaps
          as suitable as any other form of government to the
          condition of the country ; but whether it will
          maintain this character after the population of the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name> has become as dense as that of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, and great diversities of wealth and intelligence
          have arisen, is a question which time
          alone can determine.</p>

                <head>Revolutions.</head>
                <p>A revolution is the overthrow of a government
          by some kind of convulsion out of the usual course
          of law, generally followed by the more or less permanent
          establishment of a new one in its stead.
          Modern history contains several examples of
          revolutions. The deposition and execution of
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_I_of_England">Charles I.</name> and the establishment of a Commonwealth,
          with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_Cromwell">Cromwell</name> as dictator, formed the
          greatest revolution which has occurred in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>,
          though it is never spoken of under that definition.
          The change of dynasty in 1688, with the guarantee
          of a constitution, is referred to as <hi rend="italic">the Revolution</hi>.
          This revolution had the singular merit of being
          effected with little or no violence, a fact which, like
          the stability of the form of government which it
          introduced, was probably owing to the circumstance
          of its being, in the main, a return to the
          ancient institutions of the country. The revolt of
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Americas">American</name> colonies, and their assumption of
          independence, was a distinctly marked revolution,
          effected by military force, and crowned with a
          degree of success which astonished <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>. It
          was shortly followed by the revolution in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>
          in 1789, to the violence and consequences of which
          no parallel is found in history.</p>
                <p>Revolutions are almost invariably a result of
          misgovernment. Tenaciously clinging to old
          usages, and opposing themselves to every species
          of equitable reform required by alterations in
          society, or ruthlessly invading ancient privileges,
          governments sometimes, as in the foregoing instances,
          become so repugnant to the feelings of
          the nation, that at length a rebellion ensues, and
          if successful, it becomes a revolution. The revolution
          which placed <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_Cromwell">Cromwell</name> at the head of affairs
          in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, originated in <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_I_of_England">Charles I.</name> levying taxes
          without the concurrence of parliament, contrary
          to the constitution. The revolution of 1688 was
          caused by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_II_of_England">James II.</name> assuming arbitrary powers
          vexing to the nation, and equally at variance with
          established rights. The <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Americas">American</name> revolution
          occurred in consequence of government imposing
          taxes on the colonists, while they were not represented
          in parliament, and therefore in violation of
          the constitutional maxim of—no taxation without
          representation. The cause of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">French Revolution</name>,
          in 1789, was an entire disorder in society; <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">French Revolution</name>
          but it was precipitated by the refusal of the clergy
          and nobility to contribute to the national taxes.
          A timely concession on the part of these bodies
          to aid the declining finances, by giving up a portion
          of their unjust exemptions from taxation
          might perhaps have averted the terrible calamity
          which ensued.</p>
                <p>From every revolution which has occurred, all
          governments may learn the valuable lesson of
          acting with a prudent regard to national traditions
          on the one hand, and on the other to constantly
          changing circumstances and feelings. Without
          respecting every antiquated prejudice, or yielding to
          every clamour, it is their duty and interest to adapt
          themselves to and even to stimulate the progressive
          views of mankind ; graciously advancing with
          the intelligence of the age, keeping, if possible,
          rather before it than behind it. Lessons equally
          useful may be learned by the people from revolutions.
          To step in the slightest degree beyond the
          limits of constitutional law, and assume an attitude
          hostile to government, is always dangerous in the
          extreme - treasonable if defeated, and perhaps productive
          of unspeakable horrors if successful. Judging
          from the Cromwellian and the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">French Revolution</name>,
          besides some successful revolts of lesser note,
          it would appear that a revolution in general circumstances
          runs a certain specific course. First,
          the old government is overthrown, and one thought
          to be more liberal is established. Second, the
          new government, being composed of men who
          acted from a conscientious conviction of evils to
          be redressed, is soon found not to go far enough
          in its measures ; it is accused of being too moderate,
          and is overthrown. Third, a violent set of
          men, animated by feelings of vengeance, and professing
          boundless liberality, construct a fresh
          government. Fourth, anarchy sooner or later
          ensues, the nation is in universal disorder, and
          life and property are no longer secure. Fifth, out
          of the convulsion arises an individual, who, by his
          military genius, conquers inferior demagogues,
          and brings back a degree of tranquillity at which
          every one rejoices. Sixth, this tranquillity is
          speedily found to be a military despotism : a
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oliver_Cromwell">Cromwell</name> or a <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_I_of_France">Napoleon</name> is at the head of affairs.
          And, brought to this condition, a long course of
          suffering is endured before the nation returns to
          the constitutional point whence it set out. Varied
          according to circumstances, such is likely to be
          the progress of every revolution occurring from
          heedless, though well-intentioned, democratic invasion.
          An expectation that the original movers
          of a revolution will be suffered to conduct it to a
          conclusion, is pretty nearly hopeless. The agitation
          brings all sorts of wild schemers into play,
          and one party after another is remorselessly
          trampled down in the contest.</p>
                <p>It is now a settled political principle, that for
          revolutions to be attended with the good results
          anticipated by their promoters, they must, independently
          of other favouring circumstances, refer
          to a people who are qualified not only for selfgovernment,
          but possessed of the nerve to unite
          and defend themselves against the anarchic forces
          which are almost certain to spring up. A usual
          cause of failure in the revolutions of continental
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name> has been the political incapacity of the
          people - an incapacity amounting in some instances
          to an ignorance even of the forms necessary for
          regulating public assemblages of citizens. The
          revolution which gave independence to the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">United States</name> was successful, because, among other
          favourable circumstances, it was promoted by an<pb n="13"/>intelligent and order-loving people, accustomed to
          freedom by a preliminary training under a constitutional
          monarchy. It is often loudly maintained
          by continental politicians, and tacitly assumed by
          those at home, that, however frightful may have
          been the horrors of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">French Revolution</name>, its
          ultimate results were a vast stride in advance in
          the direction of liberty, not for <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">Frenchmen</name> alone,
          but for mankind. That <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> has suffered more
          than she has gained, is a conviction which has
          been gradually forced upon most people, as each
          fresh page in her troubled history unfolded itself.
          But the impression of the general value of the revolution
          remains, and many have been brought by
          reiterated assertion to regard it as marking the
          point at which mankind fell heir to liberties of
          which even our own forefathers never dreamed. Yet
          can we put our finger on a single point in which
          the creed of the Revolution was really an advance
          on that which had been held, and more or less
          perfectly realised, by <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people">Englishmen</name> for ages? We
          are told, for example, that <q>it transferred the ultimate
          sovereignty from the king to the people</q>;
          but the people was the ultimate sovereign in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>,
          as Mr <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edward_Augustus_Freeman">Freeman</name> has proved to us, from
          Anglo-Saxon times downwards. Then <q>it broke
          up exclusive and privileged classes</q> ; but we never
          had any exclusive classes at all, or privileged
          classes either, except the peerage, and even their
          privileges did not exempt them from citizen
          duties. It declared  <q>all careers open to talent</q> ;
          but all careers, the throne only excepted, always
          were open to talent in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>. It made <q>all
          men equal before the law</q>; but therein it only
          recognised one of our oldest constitutional maxims.
          The moment it went farther, it went wrong. It no
          doubt declared all men equal in a sense unknown
          to us : it declared them equal in rights, however
          unequal they were in merits ; whereas we had
          always followed more or less consistently the
          Aristotelian rule of making merits the measure of
          rights. But did it thereby lay the foundation of a
          wider liberty and a fairer order than ours ; or did
          it simply offer to mankind the option of anarchy
          or despotism? The latter, as yet, must be the
          response.</p>

                <head>Concluding Remarks.</head>
                <p>In considering the nature and supposed influence
          of different forms of government, of which
          the preceding notices afford examples, it is important
          to guard ourselves against the too common
          error of mistaking names for things. A despotism
          has been described as the government of an irresponsible
          individual ; and a republic, as a government
          formed by the concurrence of the whole
          people. We should, however, be liable to commit
          an error did we at once rush to the conclusion,
          that a despotism was invariably tyrannical ; and
          that a republic was certain to be in every instance
          tolerant. It may happen that a despotism is
          really the more liberal of the two. This will occur
          when the despot is an intelligent and benevolent
          man. Instead of tormenting his subjects, he will
          take a pleasure in seeing them happy and prosperous
          ; while, by a sleepless and undistracted
          vigilance, he will conduct the government with a
          degree of firmness and efficiency not to be equalled
          by a miscellaneously composed body. Such a
          beneficent government as this, is said to be <hi rend="italic">paternal</hi>;
          the sovereign acting as if he were the father
          and guardian of his people. Could it be possible
          to secure a continuance of sovereigns of this character,
          we might almost arrive at the conviction
          that despotisms were the best forms of government
          ; but, unfortunately, there is no security on
          this score ; an evil may follow a well-disposed
          ruler, and suddenly the nation may be thrown into
          confusion. On this account, it should be the object
          of despotisms of the paternal character to prepare
          the people for the degree of self-government incidental
          to a constitutional monarchy ; and having
          done so, to grant a constitution which will insure
          good government on a permanent basis.</p>
                <p>That republics may be liberal and tolerant
          only in name, we have too many examples in
          history. Not to go farther back than the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">French Revolution</name> of 1789- 1793, what despotism ever
          equalled, or came within many degrees of, the
          republican Convention, which for years oppressed
          and deluged <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> in blood ! Not even the
          tyranny of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nero">Nero</name> or <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caligula">Caligula</name> could be compared to
          the disregard of all public and private rights
          manifested by that iniquitous and popularly constituted
          body. The only historical episode that
          approaches it in atrocity is the brief reign of the
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris_Commune">Commune</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name> in 1871. The weak point in
          all republics is, that the most noisy and forward,
          who are usually the most ignorant, gain the
          ascendency, and, under colour of constitutional
          privilege, tyrannise over the more quietly disposed
          and intelligent citizens, many of whom, shrinking
          from the turbulence of faction, retire altogether
          from public affairs; so that, finally, the much
          admired republican government is found to be a
          mere government by venal and presumptuous
          demagogues. The same danger, in kind, if not in
          degree, attends all states, whatever their form, in
          which the ultimate sovereignty rests with the
          numerical majority. All this we mention, in consequence
          of the value which we attach to liberty as
          a reality, and in order to put people on their guard
          against the illusions of a name. Let it be remembered
          that government is a complex machine, fulfilling
          a wide variety of purposes, and that it is to
          be judged of less from the precise nature of its construction,
          than the quality of the work it performs.
          Another conclusion we arrive at is - That good
          government, although it certainly promotes the
          civilisation of a country, is much more its consequence
          than its cause ; and that attention to the
          conduct and constitution of government, although
          a duty of the citizen, is only one of many public
          duties not less important and necessary both to
          the general wellbeing of society and the happiness
          of the individual</p>

                <head>GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION.</head>
                <p>Whatever be the form of government, it requires
          to be conducted by a set of functionaries
          capable of superintending the different branches
          of the public service. The chief officials at the
          head of affairs, and who act as the cabinet council
          of the sovereign, are usually styled <hi rend="italic">ministers</hi>, a
          word signifying servants ; and collectively they
          are called the <hi rend="italic">ministry</hi>. In constitutional governments
          the ministry are appointed by the sovereign,
          and take on themselves the entire responsibility
          of all acts of the crown. The British
          ministry, which is constructed on no broad principle,
          but is merely a result of occasional additions<pb n="14"/>dictated by special circumstances, is as follows : 1.
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Lord_of_the_Treasury">First Lord of the Treasury</name> ; 2. <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Chancellor">Lord High Chancellor</name>

          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster">Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster</name>. Such
          usually compose the cabinet ; but there are
          nearly twenty other ministers - as <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</name>,
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postmaster_General_of_the_United_Kingdom">Postmaster-general</name> ; and occasionally several
          of these are included in the cabinet, while one
          or two of those above specified are excluded.
          There is, in short, no distinctly settled ministry
          in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>. The whole affair is a matter of
          arrangement at each change of ministry.</p>
                <p>The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Lord_of_the_Treasury">First Lord of the Treasury</name> is in general
          Prime-minister, and sometimes, as at present,
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</name>. The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Home_Department">Secretary of State for the Home Department</name> may be said to
          stand at the head of the executive as far as the
          internal affairs of the country are concerned. The
          appointment of judges, sheriffs, and other functionaries
          is in his hands. Military affairs come
          under the jurisdiction of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secretary_of_State_for_War">Secretary at War</name> and
          Commander-in-chief. The royal navy is similarly
          regulated by the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lords_Commissioners_of_the_Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</name>,
          and other members composing his council. The
          finances come under the cognisance and responsibility
          of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</name>.</p>
                <p>For the sake of local administration, the country
          is divided into counties, divisions anciently under
          the charge of earls or counts, but now committed
          to sheriffs and other officers. The <hi rend="italic">sheriff</hi>, however, is a functionary of old standing. The title
          is derived from <hi rend="italic">shire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reeve</hi>—the reeve of the
          shire. Reeve is an old title for an officer of
          justice inferior in rank to an alderman, and is
          derived from the <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_English">Anglo-Saxon</name> term <hi rend="italic">gerefa</hi>. In
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>, the sheriff of a county is a judge ordinary
          of his bounds, besides being intrusted with
          the execution of writs issuing from the crown.
          Towns possessing burghal privileges are exempted
          from the administration of sheriffs, and are
          governed by town-councils, including a burgh
          magistracy - such councils being annually elected
          by the parliamentary voters or qualified inhabitants.
          The chief magistrate of a town in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>
          is entitled <hi rend="italic">Mayor</hi>; in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>, <hi rend="italic">Provost</hi>. In
          the principal cities only, the prefix Lord is added.
          In towns, and also in the rural districts, there is
          a miscellaneous magistracy, styled <hi rend="italic">Justices of the
          Peace</hi>, who are nominated by the crown, and who
          possess a limited jurisdiction in civil and criminal
          matters.</p>
                <p>The British is the least centralised government
          in the world, and in no other country is so much
          unpaid labour performed for the public, or performed
          so well.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Diplomacy</head>
                <p>Is in all countries a separate branch of administration,
          which relates to intercourse with foreign
          powers. The persons deputed to act as foreign
          ministers are of several classes. Those of the
          highest class, called <hi rend="italic">ambassadors</hi>, are not merely
          the agents of their governments, but represent
          their sovereign personally, and receive honours
          and enjoy privileges accordingly. The second
          class are envoys extraordinary and ministers
          plenipotentiary. A third class are called residents
          and <hi rend="italic">chargés d'affaires</hi>. Consuls, of whom
          there are various grades, are confined in their
          duties to commercial affairs, and conduct no
          correspondence in relation to state-policy; yet,
          along with the whole ambassadorial class, they
          are expected to succour all subjects of the power
          which they represent, and facilitate their journey
          as to passports, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Ambassadors, and even ministers plenipotentiary,
          have young gentlemen with them called <hi rend="italic">attachés</hi>,
          who have no particular charge, but merely this
          title, to connect them with the legation, and to
          give them admission into the highest society.
          Sometimes they are sons of noble families, who
          are preparing themselves for diplomatic offices,
          and to whom the lighter duties of the embassy are
          intrusted. The suite of ambassadors always includes
          more individuals than the business of the
          embassy requires, a certain degree of pomp being
          considered necessary. An ambassador has generally
          three, always two secretaries of legation;
          other ministers often but one. A foreign minister
          receives letters of credence from his court, of
          which he delivers an attested copy to the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secretary_of_State_(United_Kingdom)">Secretary
          of State</name>, and afterwards gives himself to the
          monarch, or head of the government - if he is an
          ambassador, in a public audience ; if not, in a
          private audience. After the reception of the credentials,
          the minister is said to be acknowledged.
          In some countries, he puts the arms of his nation
          or sovereign on his mansion. After his credentials
          have been received, he makes formal visits
          to the other ambassadors, to be recognised by
          them as such. These arrangements have been to
          some extent modified in this country in recent
          times, and as the Foreign Office is now far more
          exacting than formerly, our embassies have
          become comparatively hard-working institutions.
          From the moment that a minister enters the
          territory of the sovereign to whom he is sent, his
          person is held sacred and inviolable, and he
          acquires important privileges. To these belongs,
          first of all, his freedom from territorial restrictions - that is, he is not regarded as an inhabitant of
          the country ; but his person, suite, house, equipage,
          &amp;c. are considered as never having left the
          country to which he belongs, and as being without
          the jurisdiction of that in which he actually
          resides. From this follows the freedom of foreign
          ministers from the civil and criminal law ; and
          the same applies to their suite ; and all property
          belonging to a minister is free from taxes,
          &amp;c. No common police-officer, tax-gatherer,
          or other public servant, can enter his hotel and
          make inquisition, as in the house of a private
          citizen. One of the especial privileges of ambassadors
          is that of worshipping according to
          the forms of their own religion in countries where
          their religion is not tolerated. In general, an
          embassy is considered as ended from the moment
          when the minister shews his letters of recall, or
          receives his passports for his journey home.
          When these are furnished him, he must leave
          the country ; but his person remains inviolable
          even in case of war, and he is allowed to retire
          unmolested. The same inviolability of person
          is enjoyed in time of peace, by couriers and<pb n="15"/>expresses, as also by persons who, without any
          public character as envoys, are intrusted by
          their governments with the transaction of affairs
          of importance, and requiring secrecy and despatch
          ; but these are not allowed to assume the
          state of a minister, and, in their relations to other
          citizens, are regarded as private persons merely.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>Forces.</head>
                <p>Every government employs force in the execution
          of its orders, or in defence of its rights. This
          force is divided into two departments, civil and
          military. The civil force consists of constables
          and other functionaries usually employed in the
          execution of legal judgments, in the maintenance
          of public peace, and in the enforcement of municipal
          regulations. Military force is quite a different
          thing : it is an organisation of men armed
          with weapons capable of inflicting wounds and
          death. In forces of this latter kind are included
          an army and a navy (see MILITARY AND NAVAL ORGANISATION). In the present day, with
          all its enlightenment, every civilised community
          less or more feels itself obliged to maintain an
          army; although many look forward to a time
          when international law and arbitration will supersede
          war.</p>

                <head>HERADLRY - RANKS - TITLES</head>
                <p>No characteristic distinguishes so strongly a
          civilised from a barbarous people as the preservation
          of historical memorials. Savages have no
          history, and even their traditions lose all distinctness
          when they extend beyond the generation
          immediately preceding. And as historical nations
          retrograde in civilisation, they forget their past,
          even whilst they retain many traces of the culture
          which they owe to it. The <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kabyle_people">Kabyles</name>, or <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berber_people">Berbers</name>
          of the northern coast of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name>, whom their long
          contact with <name type="people">Phoenicians</name>, <name type="people">Carthaginians</name>, and
          <name type="people">Romans</name> had raised to a high degree of culture,
          and who had been the hearers of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine</name> and
          <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertullian">Tertullian</name> in their day, have continued in some
          parts of the country to produce a species of poetry
          which it was supposed might throw light on their
          own conceptions of their history. But when translated
          by the industry of European scholars, these
          effusions were found to have reference almost exclusively
          to quite recent eventsm - chiefly to the
          French conquest of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeria">Algeria</name>. It is the same with
          families as with nations. Cultivated and progressive
          families retain, ignorant and retrograde families
          lose, the memory of the generations that have
          passed away. It is as a means of preserving family
          history, and of marking the relationships in which
          the different branches of families stand to each
          other, that the curious science of heraldry has
          kept its place in modern life. Originally, it was
          used for a different purpose. It consisted of an
          ingenious system of emblems and marks, which
          were painted on the shields of knights and nobles,
          in order that they might be readily distinguishable
          in battle. After these emblems ceased to serve
          their original purpose, they were retained by the
          families to whose heads they originally belonged,
          and are still cherished by their descendants as
          precious memorials. In the first instance, it is
          probable that each warrior adopted whatever
          emblem he fancied. But such license, it is
          obvious, must very soon have led to endless confusion,
          and defeated the whole objects of the
          institution. With a view to obviating this inconvenience,
          the right of granting armorial ensigns
          suited to the rank and condition of the wearer,
          was, at an early period, assumed by the sovereigns
          of this and all other European countries, and penalties
          were imposed upon those who arrogated to
          themselves emblems which they had not derived
          from this source. As the duty thus undertaken
          could not, except in very rare instances, be performed
          by the sovereigns in person, they delegated
          their authority to their heralds, who, in general,
          had made a study of what had now become a very
          refined and complicated branch of knowledge.
          It was thus that the heralds, whose function had
          been to proclaim within the lists the armorial
          bearings which individual knights had assumed,
          came to be government officials intrusted with
          the duty of conferring them and adjusting them to
          the condition of the wearers in the community at
          large. Jurisdiction in questions of arms has long
          been, and is now, vested, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, in the
          <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/College_of_Arms">Heralds' College</name> ; in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>, in the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_the_Lord_Lyon">Lyon Court</name>;
          and in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland">Ireland</name>, in the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/College_of_Arms">College of Arms</name>. No one
          is entitled to bear arms unless he can claim them
          either by hereditary male descent from a person
          who has obtained them, or has himself obtained
          them by grant from the competent authority.
          Penalties, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland">Scotland</name>, of rather a severe kind,
          may be enforced against any one by whom arms
          are assumed. The unauthorised use even of a
          crest renders the assumer legally subject to these
          penalties, whilst it involves the payment of assessed
          taxes equally as if the crest were genuine. Penalties
          for the use of false arms are seldom enforced,
          except in the case of a formal complaint
          being made to the Lyon by some one whose
          rights have been invaded. The social ridicule
          attending an act which in kind is the same as if a
          commoner were to call himself a lord, is generally
          found a sufficient deterrent, and practically, false
          arms are assumed only by ignorant and vulgar
          persons.<pb n="16"/>

                <p>REFERRING the reader for all that appertains
          to the general constitution of the
          globe to the article on PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
          No. 4), we purpose, in this and several following
          sheets, to direct attention to the special features of
          the respective continents - describing the territories
          of the several states, their natural products,
          their commercial industry, population, laws, religion,
          and other topics usually comprehended
          under the title of POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY.</p>
                <p>Constituting but a fragment of the Old or
          Eastern World, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>, strictly speaking, is not
          entitled to be called an independent continent. But though the smallest of the <hi rend="italic">quarters</hi>
          into which geographers have divided the globe,
          it is by far the most important - its inhabitants
          giving now, as they have long done, the tone and
          character to human progress. Its limits are
          usually comprehended within the 36th and 71st
          degrees of north latitude, and the 10th degree of
          west and 68th of east longitude ; thus placing it
          almost wholly within the northern temperate zone.
          Including the islands, which contain about 317,000
          square miles, the land superficies of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name> is
          estimated at rather more than 3,720,000 square
          miles ; its population at nearly 328,000,000. If
          we count the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">German Empire</name> as one state only,
          there are in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name> upwards of 20 states in all.
          The leading states, usually styled  <q>the Five Great
            Powers of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>
                    </q>, are <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia">Russia</name>,
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> (representing <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>), <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>, and
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria">Austria</name> ; but the vast changes that have taken
          place on the continent since the close of the
          <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crimean_War">Crimean wa</name>r, have entirely altered their relative
          importance. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name> also might fairly claim, since
          its unification, a place among the leading states.
          Those of a secondary rank are <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweden">Sweden</name>,
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denmark">Denmark</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holland">Holland</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium">Belgium</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland">Swiss Confederation</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Turkey">Turkey</name>. It is no longer
          necessary to assign any rank to the minor states
          of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">German Empire</name>, since, even where not
          absorbed by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name>, they have no military independence,
          and, therefore, no place in European
          politics. It is to the continental or foreign states
          that we now confine our description, reserving the
          component parts of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</name> - <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>,

                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>, one of the largest and most important

          42° 20' and 51° 5' north, and long 8° 15' east and
          4° 54' west. It is bounded on the north by the

          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prussia">Prussia</name> ; on the east, by the German
          territory of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</name> (annexed in 1871 at
          the close of the war with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>), by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland">Switzerland</name>,
          and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name> ; on the south, by the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</name>

          greatest length of the country from north to south
          is 676 miles, and its greatest breadth from east
          to west is 494 ; its area, including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corsica">Corsica</name>, is a
          little over 204,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Superficially</hi>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> may be described as a flat
          country, the greater portion consisting of valleylike
          tracts or open plateaux, with low hilly ranges
          or swelling eminences between. The principal
          ranges which diversify the surface are - 1. The
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vosges">Vosges</name>, on the north-east, presenting rounded
          outlines, with gentle slopes, and affording much
          open pasture ; the highest point over 7000 feet.
          2. The <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jura_Mountains">Jura Mountains</name>, lying south of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vosges">Vosges</name>,
          and forming part of the boundary between <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>
          and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland">Switzerland</name>, the extreme height of which is
          about 6000 feet. 3. The <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cévennes">Cevennes</name>, and other
          portions of the long range which forms, as it were,
          the western brim of the valley of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saône">Saone</name> and
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhone">Rhone</name> : the highest points do not exceed 5800
          feet. This range may be said to form the great
          water-shed of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>, from which all the large
          rivers flow in a north-west direction to the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name>.
          4. The clustering hills of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Auvergne_(region)">Auvergne</name>, or Central <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>, remarkable for their crateriform tops and
          recent volcanic origin, the highest of which reaches
          an elevation of 6200 feet. The largest and best
          defined <hi rend="italic">river-basins</hi> or <hi rend="italic">valleys</hi> are those of the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saône">Saone</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhone">Rhone</name> on the east, which may be
          regarded as one ; those of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adour">Adour</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garonne">Garonne</name>,
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lot_River">Lot</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://sws.geonames.org/3021044/">Dordogne</name> on the south and south-west;
          those of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loire_River">Loire</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine">Seine</name> in the centre ; and
          those of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somme_(river)">Somme</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meuse_River">Meuse</name> on the north.
          The soil of most of these valleys is a fine deep
          alluvium, with a greater or less admixture of sand.
          There are large tracts of heath in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brittany">Bretagne</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anjou">Anjou</name>,
          and <name type="Place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maine_(province)">Maine</name> ; and the Atlantic sea-board presents
          in many places, as in the tract called the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Landes_forest">Landes</name>,
          wide expanses covered with sand-dunes.</p>
                <p>The great <hi rend="italic">rivers</hi> exclusively French have all a
          westerly flow towards the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name> ; those flowing
          northward - the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scheldt">Scheldt</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sambre">Sambre</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meuse_River">Meuse</name> - have
          only the upper portions of their courses in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> ;
          and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhone">Rhone</name>, the sole large river running southward,
          has also a great portion of its course in
          another country. Of those flowing westward, the
          most important are the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seine">Seine</name>, the , and the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garonne">Garonne</name>.</p>
                <p>
                    <q>
                        <hi rend="italic">Geologically</hi>
                    </q>, says one authority, <q>the whole of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> may be considered as one extensive basin,
          the circumference and centre of which consist of
          primitive formations, the intermediate space being
          filled with those of a secondary and tertiary kind.</q>
          Taking this statement as a mere proximate outline,
          we find primary rocks in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ardennes">Ardennes</name> on the
          north ; in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vosges">Vosges</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jura_Mountains">Jura</name>, and Alpine ridges on
          the east ; in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</name> on the south ; in
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brittany">Bretagne</name>, <name type="Place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maine_(province)">Maine</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normandy">Normandy</name> on the west;
          and, centrally, in the hilly ranges of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Auvergne_(region)">Auvergne</name>.
          Lying upon these in many places, without the
          intervention of the transition and older secondary
          strata, occur the coal-measures, the oolite<pb n="17"/>limestones and shales, and the chalk ; and not unfrequently
          even the coal-measures are absent, and
          the oolitic and chalk repose immediately on the
          upper primaries. The tertiaries generally occupy
          the great river-drainage of the centre, shewing
          that at no very distant epoch a large portion of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> was a shallow sea or estuary of deposit
          The chief <hi rend="italic">minerals</hi> are - coal, of which it possesses
          several considerable beds, principally in the east
          and north, the amount raised, however, being less
          than one-twelfth of that raised in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>;
          iron largely from ten or twelve districts ; gypsum,
          or plaster of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris">Paris</name>, in unlimited quantities ; and
          abundance of building-stone of various kinds,
          granite, freestone, marble, slate, basalt, lava, &amp;c.
          With the exception of iron, the other metals are
          of no great commercial importance.</p>
                <p>Geographers have divided the <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> of France
          into four regions - namely, 1. The most southerly,
          in which the vine, olive, mulberry, and orange
          flourish, bounded north and west by a line drawn
          from <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bagnères-de-Luchon">Bagnères-de-Luchon</name>, in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</name>, to
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Die,_Drôme">Die</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drôme">Drôme</name> ; 2. That through which the cultivation
          of the vine and maize extends, stretching
          as far north as a line passing from the mouth
          of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Garonne">Garonne</name> to the northern extremity of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alsace">Alsace</name> ; 3. That region which terminates with
          the culture of the vine, near a line drawn from the
          mouth of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loire_River">Loire</name> to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charleville-Mézières">Mezieres</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ardennes">Ardennes</name> ; and
          4. The remaining portion of the country, having a
          climate somewhat allied to that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England">England</name>, and
          yielding rich verdant pastures and forest growth.
          Along the entire western coast the climate is distinguished
          by a greater degree of humidity than
          in any other district ; the south and east have
          about a third fewer rainy days than the north and
          west ; winter is often pretty severely felt in the
          north-east ; snow seldom lies in the central and
          southern regions, yet the Mediterranean districts
          in particular are exposed at times to the ravages
          of the burning winds which have passed over the
          deserts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name>, and to the destructive northwest
          wind known as the <hi rend="italic">mistral</hi>, which often does
          great injury to the fields near the mouths of the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhone">Rhone</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Var_River">Var</name>.</p>
                <p>Of grains and vegetables largely cultivated, we
          may enumerate wheat, rye, oats, maize, millet,
          buckwheat, kidney-beans, pease, carrot, beet,
          melons, potatoes, flax, hemp, and tobacco ; and
          madder, saffron, and hops on a smaller scale. Of
          fruit-trees, the vine, olive, orange, pistachio, fig,
          apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, and cherry,
          with which we may also class the mulberry and
          caper. Of forest-trees, the oak, beech, maple,
          ash, chestnut, walnut, birch, poplar, larch, pine,
          fir, box, cornel, acacia, and cork-tree. The forestgrowth
          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> is said to cover about oneseventh
          of the entire surface, an amount which
          is rendered necessary by the use of wood as the
          chief domestic fuel.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">wild animals</hi> are fast diminishing from the
          soil of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> ; the lynx is rarely seen, even
          among the higher Alpine regions ; but wolves are
          still numerous in the mountainous districts of the
          central departments ; while the chamois and wildgoat,
          as well as the marmot, ermine, and hamster,
          are found among the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/ALPS">Alps</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vosges">Vosges</name>.
          The wild-boar, roebuck, fox, squirrel, polecat,
          and marten are to be met with in the woods.
          The red and fallow deer are scarce ; hares and
          rabbits abound, and game generally is plentiful.
          The <hi rend="italic">insects</hi> of any economical importance are
          the bee, silkworm, gall-nut fly, and the blisteringfly.
          Respecting the breeds of the <hi rend="italic">domesticated
          animals</hi>, if we except the merino sheep and
          poultry, it may be safely asserted that they have
          hitherto been inferior to those of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>.
          A spirit of improvement, however, has of late
          sprung up. During the half-century, for example,
          from 1812 to 1862, the number of homed cattle
          was doubled in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fisheries</hi> are not on a great scale, in spite
          of liberal help from the state. The coasts of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Normandy">Normandy</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brittany">Brittany</name>, however, yield large
          quantities of pilchards and mackerel. The  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bay_of_Biscay">Bay of Biscay</name> has extensive oyster and mussel beds ;
          while tunnies and anchovies are caught on the
          shores of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</name>.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi> may now be arranged under
          four distinct heads or races : 1. The <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">
                        <hi rend="italic">French</hi>
                    </name>
          proper, constituting nine-tenths of the population,
          and consisting of the descendants of the ancient
          Romanised inhabitants of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gaul">Gaul</name>, with a considerable
          admixture of Germanic blood infused at the
          overthrow of the Roman dominion ; with these
          may be classed the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/page/Italian_people">Italians</name> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corsica">Corsica</name> ; 2. The

          securing them against much external influence ;

                    </name>, who are
          found in all the principal towns. There are thus
          four distinct languages spoken within the country - <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_language">French</name> and <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italian_language">Italian</name> (both of <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin">Latin</name> origin), <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celtic_languages">Celtic</name>,
          and <name type="language" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basque_language">Basque</name> ; independent of several widely differing
          provincial dialects. In 1881, the population of
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> was 37,672,048.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Roman Catholic faith</hi> is the predominant
          religion, the adherents of all the other denominations
          being under 2,000,000. Though it is thus
          the national religion, it is not exclusively associated
          with the state ; for Catholic and Protestant,
          Jewish and Mussulman clergy, are paid out of the
          public revenue. The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic Church</name>
          has about 54,000 clergy of all ranks ; while the
          Protestant ministers number scarce 800, and the
          rabbis less than 70. Public education is entirely
          managed by the government. The <hi rend="italic">facultés</hi>, practically
          universities, are fifteen in number. There
          is in every department an <hi rend="italic">Académie</hi>, or board of
          education, consisting of a rector and council, of
          which the bishop or bishops of the department
          and a Protestant clergyman are members. The
          direction of the educational matters of the department
          is in the hands of this board, subject to
          the control of the Minister of Public Instruction.
          Nearly every commune has one or more primary
          schools, the larger communes have also secondary
          schools, and the more important centres have
          institutions of a higher grade, called colleges and
          lyceums, which serve as preparatory to the universities.
          There is in general a <q>normal school</q>
          or seminary for training elementary teachers in
          every department ; while the superior <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/École_Normale_Supérieure">Normal
          School of Paris</name> trains professors for the lyceums.
          It is allowed on all hands that education has
          made great progress in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> within the last
          generation ; yet there must have been something
          very unsatisfactory in the methods of instruction,
          for in 1870-80, there were nearly eight millions of<pb n="18"/>the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">French</name> population above 20 years of age who
          were unable to read or write, as well as 20 per
          cent, of those under 20 years. Perhaps the cause
          of this lies to some extent in the hostile attitude
          of the dominant church to enlightened instruction.
          Roman Catholic children seldom remain at school
          after eleven or twelve years of age, and are consequently
          apt to forget, in after-years, the little they
          may have been indiflferently taught. But the
          quality of education varies in different parts of the
          country ; in the east and north, it is more general
          and more effective than in the southern districts.</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">national industry</hi>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> may
          be regarded more as an agricultural than a manufacturing
          country. By the law of inheritance, the
          property of a father is divided equally among his
          children ; and consequently, there is a progressive
          tendency to more minute divisions and subdivisions
          of the land. According to the latest
          official returns, the cultivated land of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>, embracing
          an area of 90,00x3,000 acres, was divided
          into 5,550,000 distinct properties. Of these properties,
          over 5,000,000 were under six acres in
          extent, and the result is a generally mean condition
          of rural affairs, and a deficiency of high-class
          systematic agriculture. The chief agricultural
          product is bread-corn, chiefly wheat. The next
          article in importance is wine. Silk and olive-oil
          are largely produced in the south ; and from beetroot
          are manufactured yearly above 300 million
          pounds of sugar. Poultry is a more important
          article of agricultural produce in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> than
          elsewhere. In <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> ranks next
          to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>. The leading articles are silks,
          woollens, tapestry, shawls, cotton, shoes, gloves,
          hardware, &amp;c. The <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">French</name> specially excel in
          articles of ornament and <hi rend="italic">mode</hi>, wherever skill and
          taste are required, and the manufacturer must
          also be an artist. <hi rend="italic">Ship-building</hi> is carried on at
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rochefort,_Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brest,_France">Brest</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</name>, &amp;c. ; and in enginebuilding
          and other heavy machinery, the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">French</name>
          are beginning to attain considerable eminence.
          The <hi rend="italic">commerce</hi> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> has enormously ineased
          since the peace in 1815 ; the annual
          value of her imports and exports together, during
          he fifteen years from 1867 to 1881, being on an
          average nearly 240 millions sterling. The number
          of vessels that entered the harbours of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>
          in 1881 were 35,420, with a tonnage of 11,675,750;
          departures, 23,373 vessels, tonnage, 7,527,000.
          The mercantile marine in 1880 consisted of 15,058
          vessels, having a tonnage of 919,298 ; of these,
          652 were steamers, with a tonnage of 277,760.
          The internal communication of the country is
          carried on by well-kept roads - these being classed
          into national, departmental, and communal, according as they are upheld by the government, or
          by the departments and communes to which they
          belong ; by river-navigation, of which there is
          upwards of 5616 miles ; by 2250 miles of canal;
          and by railways, of which, according to the official
          report of 1882, about 16,500 miles are in operation.
          About 10,000 miles more are arranged for.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name> has repeatedly
          changed its form since the first great <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Revolution">Revolution</name>
          in the end of the eighteenth century. On September 4, 1870, the Emperor <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon_III_of_France">Napoleon III.</name> was
          declared to be no longer the head of the state,
          and a republic was proclaimed. At the close of
          1872, the supreme power was vested in a <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)">National
          Assembly</name>, with whom rests the nomination of the
          chief officer of the state, bearing the title of President
          of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">French Republic</name>. He is authorised
          to execute all laws and ordinances passed by
          the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)">Assembly</name>. The <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)">Assembly</name> consists of two

          ; and the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Senate_of_France">Senate</name> of 300 members. There

          the revenue amounted to about 2,856,500,000
          francs (£114,000,000), and the expenses to about
          3,315,000,000 francs (£132,500,000). In the same
          year the public debt was about £96o,ooo,ooo,
          one half of which was incurred in the dreadful
          war of 1870. The army, according to the government
          estimates of 1882, is calculated at 498,500
          men ; the effect of the new law of military service
          passed by the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Assembly_(French_Revolution)">National Assembly</name> in 1872, being
          that practically the whole <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_people">French</name> people are subjected

                <p>These two perfectly distinct and independent
          kingdoms belong to a region so unique in character
          and situation, that we shall treat them, in
          regard to their physical geography, as one. This
          region, commonly known in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Britain</name> as <q>the Peninsula</q>,
          lies at the south-western extremity of the
          European continent, with which it is connected
          by an isthmus 230 miles broad, and is situated
          between lat. 36° and 43° 46' north, and between
          long. 3° 20' east and 9° 30' west. It is bounded
          on the north by the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bay_of_Biscay">Bay of Biscay</name>, and by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>,
          from which it is separated by the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</name> ; on
          the east, by the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</name> ; on the south, by
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strait_of_Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</name>, and
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name> ; and on the west, wholly by the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name>. The only islands geographically connected
          are the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Balearic_Islands">Balearic</name> - an important group, exhibiting
          in miniature all the characteristic features
          of the mainland. The area thus included is computed
          at 231,577 square miles, of which 195,766
          belong to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name>, and 3S,8ii to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name>.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">superficial character</hi>, the Peninsula is
          decidedly mountainous. The interior may be
          considered as one vast table-land, from 2000 to
          3000 feet above the level of the sea, traversed by
          numerous mountains, and intersected by rivers.
          Around this central nucleus extends a narrow belt
          of maritime low land, sloping gradually towards
          the sea, and broken into an alternation of hills
          and valleys, which produce a most agreeable
          variety of aspect, and present a pleasing contrast
          to the bleak and barren sameness by which the
          central region is characterised. The principal
          mountain chains, all of which run east and west
          across the Peninsula, are : (1) the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cantabrian_Mountains">Cantabrian
            Mountains</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrenees">Pyrenees</name>, forming the most
          northern range ; (2) the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sierra_de_Guadarrama">Sierra de Guadarrama</name>;
          (3) the <name type="place">Sierra de Toledo</name> ; (4) <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sierra_Morena">Sierra Morena</name> ; (5)
          the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sierra_Nevada_(Spain)">Sierra Nevada</name>, running parallel to the shores
          of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</name>. Between these ranges flow
          the great rivers of the Peninsula - the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ebro">Ebro</name>, the
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Douro">Douro</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tagus">Tagus</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guadiana">Guadiana</name>, and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</name>,
          all of which, except the first, discharge
          their waters into the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name>, and form channels<pb n="19"/>of communication with the interior. In this
          respect the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</name> is the most important,
          being navigable for vessels of 100 tons to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seville">Seville</name>,
          about 80 miles from its mouth. The principal
          economic minerals are - granite, marble, serpentine,
          common limestone, coal, rock-salt, gypsum,
          alabaster, meerschaum, and several of the precious
          stones ; the metals - iron, lead, silver, mercury,
          tin, copper, antimony, and cobalt.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, as might be expected from the
          position and physical conformation of the region,
          is extremely diversified. All along the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</name>
          sea-board, the temperature is mild and
          equable, seldom sinking below 32°, and generally
          ranging between 55° and 60° Fahrenheit. Here
          snow is almost unknown, and verdure is rarely
          checked, unless during the occasional droughts
          of summer. On the central plateau, matters are
          quite reversed ; the summer's heat is excessive,
          and the winter's cold, rendered keener by stormy
          blasts from the mountains, is equally so. In this
          region the winter is long, and snow covers the
          sierras ; while the summer is short, and so hot,
          that verdure is often destroyed. On the northern
          and western sea-board the summer becomes
          cooler ; and the winds, charged with moisture
          from the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name>, bring rains and other atmospheric
          diversities.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vegetation</hi> of a country so diversified in
          surface and climate must necessarily present great
          variety, and thus we find within its limits the
          banana and palm of the tropics, and the pine of
          the northern regions. Besides the usual grains
          and fruits, the vine, olive, sugar-cane, and mulberry
          are largely cultivated. The <hi rend="italic">animal kingdom</hi>
          presents only one or two features worthy of
          notice. The principal wild animals are - the bear;
          wolf, fox, herds of wild-boar, lynx, wild-cat, and
          monkey ; the vulture, quail, bustard, flamingo,
          and some African birds ; and of insects economically
          important, may be mentioned the bee,
          silkworm, gall-nut fly, and cantharides. The distinguishing
          features in the domesticated animals
          are - the horse, of Arab extraction ; mules, the
          finest in the world ; and the merino sheep.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> of both countries is Roman
          Catholic. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name>, the whole population, with
          the exception of about 34,000 persons, nominally
          adhere to that faith ; but recent political events
          seem to have proved that large sections of the
          populace are imbued with notions hostile to all
          forms of the Christian religion. The <hi rend="italic">Intransigentes</hi>
          of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cartagena,_Spain">Carthagena</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barcelona">Barcelona</name>, and other large
          cities are in favour of subverting all ecclesiastical,
          as well as all civil organisations, and even the
          moderate liberals are probably sceptical in regard
          to the utility of the church. In 1862 <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name> possessed
          about 40,000 clergy of all ranks, including
          9 archbishops and 43 bishops. The Primate of the
          church is the archbishop of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toledo,_Spain">Toledo</name>. <hi rend="italic">Education</hi>
          at the close of last century was in a deplorable
          state. In 1797, less than 400,000 children were at
          school ; but since the government undertook the
          superintendence of the matter, great progress has
          been made, and in 1880 more than 1,769,000 were
          attending school <hi rend="italic">Secondary</hi> education is given in
          Institutions, or middle-class schools, which prepare
          for the universities, of which there are ten.</p>
                <p>
                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name> has not more than 500 professed Protestants,
          mostly foreigners. The clergy number
          over 3800, and the head of the church is the
          <q>Patriarch</q> of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lisbon">Lisbon</name>, who is always a cardinal.
          There are also two archbishops and fourteen
          bishops. The superintendence of public instruction
          is under the management of a superior
          council of education, and is entirely free from the
          control of the church. The kingdom possesses
          one university, that of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coimbra">Coimbra</name>, which has 46
          professors and lecturers, and about 900 students.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">industrial</hi> pursuits of the two kingdoms
          composing the Peninsula are much of the same
          kind and character. Both are more agricultural
          than manufacturing or commercial countries;
          comprehending under the former term all that
          appertains to grain, fruits, herds, and other produce
          depending upon the soil. But <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name>, during
          the last twenty years, has made more progress
          than <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name>, whose agriculture is particularly
          wretched. In <hi rend="italic">mining</hi>, of late, considerable activity
          has been exhibited, principally, however, through
          the agency of foreign companies, in the quicksilver,
          lead, and iron departments. In the <hi rend="italic">arts</hi>
          and <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>, neither country exhibits much
          skill or activity. Their commerce, once the
          greatest in the world, fell off miserably during the
          17th and 18th centuries, but is reviving again.
          During the ten years from 1862 to 1872, their
          exports to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name> doubled themselves. The
          chief exports of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name> are - wine, quicksilver, lead,
          wool, raisins, figs, oranges, lemons, and other
          fruits ; olive-oil, barilla, cork-bark, honey, and
          occasionally wheat - the total value during the
          years 1877-81 averaging £20,000,000 annually:
          those of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portugal">Portugal</name> are wine, oranges, lemons, figs,
          and other fruits ; cork-bark, olive-oil, sumach,
          wool, goats' skins, and small quantities of tallow,
          brandy, and other articles, valued in 1880 at nearly £5,500,000.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Railways</hi> and <hi rend="italic">telegraphs</hi> have now been introduced
          into both countries. In 1880, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain">Spain</name> had

          occupies the very centre of the Alpine development,
          and is consequently the most elevated and
          irregular of European countries. It is bounded
          on the north by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name> ; on the east, by
          <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria">Austria</name> ; on the south, by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name> ; and on the west,
          by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/France">France</name>. Its superficies is estimated at 15,991
          square miles, of which a large proportion is
          covered with lakes and glaciers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">superficial character</hi> of the country is suffi-ciently indicated by the mention of its position - 
          a region composed of mountain-ridges, radiating in
          every direction, with narrow and tortuous rivervalleys between. The higher mountain-ridges
          range from 6000 to 15,700 feet above the sea;
          their summits, from 9600 feet and upwards, buried
          in perpetual snow and glaciers, and their sides
          broken into every imaginable diversity of crag,
          cliff, ravine, and water-fall, dotted at intervals with
          clumps of pine and fir. The valleys, on the other
          hand, are distinguished alike for fertility and
          beauty, and form a singular contrast with the
          Tugged heights which frown above them. The
          tract lying between the Alps and the Jura Mountains,
          and in which all the great lakes, from
          Constance to Geneva, are situated, may be regarded
          as the Lowlands of Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">rock formations</hi> in the higher and central
          districts are strictly primary, flanked by transition
          and the older secondaries. The equivalents of
          four own lias and chalks are also found at great
          heights overlying the older rocks, thus marking
          the date of the Alpine and Jura elevation ; and in
          the low tract above described, occur alternations
          of soft greenish sandstones and limestones, the
          supposed equivalents of the Paris tertiaries. The
          mineral products are insignificant.</p>
                <p>Several important European <hi rend="italic">rivers</hi> - the Rhine,
          Rhone, Inn, Ticino, and Doubs - have their sources
          amid the glaciers of Switzerland, but the Aar is
          the only river of any navigable importance having
          its course exclusively within the territory of the
          Confederation. The <hi rend="italic">lakes</hi> of Switzerland, either
          as regards their extent or the beauty and magnificence of their scenery, are unexcelled by any in
            the world. The principal are - Constance, or the
            Boden-see, Geneva or Leman, Neuchâtel, Zurich,
            and Lucerne, on this side the Alps ; and portions
            of Maggiore, Lugano, &amp;c. which lie on the other
            side of the Alps, chiefly within the confines of
            Italy.</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, Switzerland is much
          colder than its latitude or its position in Europe
          would appear to warrant. While the mean annual
          temperature at London is 50.5° Fahrenheit, that
          at Bern, which is more than four degrees of latitude
          further south, is 45° ; at Zurich, 48° ; Geneva,
          49.5° &gt; at St Gothard, 30°. Of course, altitude is
          the prime cause of this deficiency. The plants of
          nearly all the different zones of Europe are found
          in Switzerland, from the vine, olive, and mulberry
          of the sunny valley, up to the herbaceous willow,
          the lichens, and mosses that struggle up to the
          confines of eternal snows.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi> are usually ranked under two
          races - the Germanic and the Celtic : the former
          comprising the German Swiss of the northern,
          eastern, and central cantons ; the latter, the
          French and Italian Swiss of the western and
          southern parts. Of the 2,846,102 inhabitants
          (1880), 2,030,000 speak German, 608,000 French,
          and 162,000 Italian ; while the language of
          38,700 inhabiting the valleys of the Grisons, is
          derived from Latin, and called Romansch.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> statistics give the Protestants
          1,667,000 of the population; the Roman Catholics,
          1,160,369; other Christian sects, 11,000; and
          Jews, 7370. Some of the cantons (Ticino, Uri,
          Unterwalden, Valais, Schwytz, Lucerne, &amp;c.) are
          almost exclusively Catholic ; while in others
          (Bern, Aargau, Basel, and Geneva), Protestantism
          predominates.</p>
                <p>In regard to <hi rend="italic">education</hi>, Switzerland holds a
          high place in Europe. In most of the Protestant
          and mixed cantons, 1 in 5 of the population may
          be assumed as attending school, and a greater
          proportion of the public revenue is devoted to
          schools of various grades than in any European
          state. The Catholic states are not quite so far up.
          There are normal schools for teachers in most of
          the cantons. For higher education there are
          gymnasia in all the chief towns ; and universities
          at Basel, Zurich, Bern, and Geneva, with 300 professors
          and teachers, and 1000 students. Several
          schools in Switzerland are distinguished for combining
          industrial training with intellectual culture.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">productive industry</hi> of the country is
          great. Although more a pastoral than agricultural
          country, a considerable area is under
          tillage, yielding excellent crops of wheat, oats,
          barley, and rye. Maize, beans, lentils, potatoes,
          turnip, hemp, and flax are also raised. It is in
          the management of the dairy that the Swiss
          chiefly excel - cattle, cheese, and butter being
          articles of export The vine is cultivated in the
          valleys ; and in some districts are large orchards of
          apples, pears, and cherries, for the manufacture of
          liqueurs. In several of the <hi rend="italic">arts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>
          the Swiss exhibit great ingenuity and taste ; and
          many branches (watch-making, wood-carving, &amp;c.)
          are carried on in the cottages of the peasants.
          Zurich is the chief seat of the silk and cotton
          manufacture. The chief industrial products for
          export are silk, cotton, watches, jewellery, and
          straw-plait. The <hi rend="italic">railway and telegraph systems</hi>
          have penetrated even into Switzerland. At the
          end of 1882, nearly 1600 miles of railway had
          been laid down; and at the end of 1881, more
          than 4000 miles of telegraph.</p>
                <p>In respect of <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, Switzerland is a
          federative republic, composed of 22 cantons, each
          of which has an internal government of its own.
          The sovereign power of the confederation is
          vested in the Federal Assembly, which consists
          of a national council and a senate or council of
          state. The first is chosen for three years, by
          universal suffrage, one member for every 20,000
          inhabitants ; the senate consists of forty-four
          members, two from each canton. The Federal<pb n="21"/>Assembly can alone make war and peace with
          other countries. It chooses a federal council or
          ministry of seven members, who conduct the
          several departments of administration. At the
          head of this executive board is the president of
          the confederation, who is chosen yearly in a
          united sitting of the assembly. Bern, with a
          population, in 1880, of 44,000, is the federal
          capital.</p>
                <p>The federal army, at the end of 1881, consisted
          of 115,700 men of all arms; besides these, the
          <hi rend="italic">landwehr</hi> of the several cantons can be called out
          by the federal authority. The federal revenue, in
          1882, was 42,000,000 francs ; the expenditure,
          rather less ; the debt is almost nominal.</p>

                <head>ITALY.</head>
                <p>Italy is partly a peninsular and partly an insular
          country, lying between lat. 36° 35' and 46° 40'
          north, and long. 6° 40' and 18° 30' east. It is
          bounded on the north by Switzerland and Austria,
          from which it is naturally separated by the
          Alps ; on the east, by the Gulf of Venice ; on the
          south, by the Mediterranean ; and on the west, by
          the Mediterranean and France. Its area, including
          that of the islands, is computed at 114,290
          square miles. The largest and most important
          of these islands are - Sicily and the Lipari group,
          Sardinia, and Elba.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Superficially</hi>, Italy exhibits much diversity and
          beauty. Guarded by the Alps, its northern fringe
          exhibits all the features of the Swiss landscape ;
          but this soon changes into scenery of the most
          opposite description - namely, the great plain of
          Lombardy, which extends along the base of these
          mountains for more than 250 miles, with an
          average breadth of 50, is flat and low, but fertile
          and well cultivated, and watered throughout by
          the Po and its numerous affluents. The only
          other mountain development is that of the Apennines,
          which, branching from the Maritime Alps
          in Genoa, ranges southward like a backbone or
          spine through the centre of the peninsula, bifurcating
          at Venosa into two minor ridges—the one
          forming the heel, the other the fore-foot of the
          fanciful boot. From the Apennines, which, in
          Gran Sasso d'ltalia (<q>The Great Rock of Italy</q>),
          attain an extreme height of 9520 feet, the country
          slopes on both sides, intersected by streams and
          valleys, and terminating near the coast in flattish
          land, forming the <q>Maremma</q> of Tuscany, the
          Roman Campagna, the Pontine Marshes, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The principal <hi rend="italic">rivers</hi> of the country are - the Po,
          with its numerous Alpine tributaries, flowing
          through the great plain of Piedmont and Lombardy,
          and falling by several mouths into the
          Gulf of Venice ; the Adige, also flowing into the
          Gulf of Venice ; the Tiber, with its small affluents,
          rising in the Apennines, and falling into the
          Mediterranean, navigable to Rome ; and the
          Amo in Tuscany, navigable to Florence, and
          connected with the Chiana, one of the tributaries
          of the Tiber, by means of a canal.</p>
                <p>As regards its <hi rend="italic">geology</hi>, granite, primary schists,
          and limestones occur in the Alps, in the northern
          extremity of the Apennines, and in their southern
          bifurcations. The great central range of the
          Apennines is said to consist chiefly of Jurassic
          limestones, occasionally broken through by older
          strata, flanked on the north by secondary rocks,
          and on the south, downwards to the Mediterranean,
          by recent tertiaries, replete with marine
          remains. Through these tertiary sandstones and
          marly limestones rise numerous volcanic hills,
          but lately extinct, or still in operation. This
          chain of volcanic action may be said to fringe the
          whole of the Mediterranean sea-board, from the
          Arno to Sicily - exhibiting numerous dormant
          craters, and the still active ones of Vesuvius, the
          Lipari Isles, and Mount Etna. The principal
          mineral products of the country are - iron, from
          Elba ; the finest statuary marble, from Carrara, in
          Modena ; sulphur, from Sicily; alum and nitre,
          from near Rome ; alabaster, from Tuscany ; puzzolana
          (a hydraulic cement), from Puzzuoli, near
          Naples ; and borax.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> of Italy has been greatly extolled ;
          but this is true only of certain localities, and under
          certain seasons. The temperature may be generally
          mild, the atmosphere of unexampled transparency,
          and the sky unclouded ; but certain
          tracts - as the Maremma of Tuscany, Campagna
          di Roma, the Pontine Marshes, &amp;c. - are subject
          to the fatal scourge of the <hi rend="italic">Malaria</hi>, while the
          southern shores are occasionally visited by the
          pestilential and enervating sirocco and simoom.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vegetable</hi> productions of Northern Italy
          differ little from those of Southern France and the
          valleys of Switzerland, already described ; the cultivation
          of rice, and the more extensive growth
          of the mulberry, being perhaps the main peculiarities.
          In Southern Italy, the products, such
          as the olive, the orange, the lemon, and the sugarcane,
          are more analogous to those of the south of
          Spain - receiving greater diversity from the successive
          stages of the Apennines, which are clothed
          in many places with forest-growth to the very
          summit.</p>
                <p>Even in ancient times the <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi> of Italy
          were not one race. The north was Celtic ; the
          region between the Arno and the Tiber, Etruscan;
          the shores of the southern half of the Peninsula,
          Greek ; but the political predominance of the
          Latin race through the conquests of Rome, in the
          course of years obliterated all primitive distinctions,
          and created a practical unity among the
          population. The vicissitudes of history have not
          materially altered this. The Lombard, the Byzantine,
          the Arab, have left untouched the noble
          impress of classic antiquity, and the language of
          Cicero and Virgil in the modern form of Italian
          still rules from the Alps to the Strait of Messina.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Roman Catholic religion</hi> is the national
          religion, and is professed by nearly the whole
          nation ; the only exceptions being the Protestant
          Waldenses in Piedmont, the Greeks in the principal
          commercial towns, and the Jews, who are
          found chiefly in Rome, Leghorn, and Venice. Yet
          here (as in Spain) there is intense hostility to the
          priesthood among the educated and liberal party.
          Infidelity is wide-spread, and even atheism is not
          rare. The number of ecclesiastics is extraordinarily
          great; in May 1869, it was reckoned that
          the proportion was seven to every thousand of the
          population, which would give over 180,000, and
          that was after the law which annihilated ecclesiastical
          jurisdiction and the privileges of the clergy
          had been in operation for eight years. The confiscation
          of monastic property by the new Italian
          government has been fortunate for the cause of
          education. The money thus obtained has been<pb n="22"/>devoted largely to the instruction of the peoiple. Primary schools are nearly universal, schools
          for training teachers are springing up, and twentytwo universities give a liberal and professional
          culture. But in 1881, the average number of the
          people above six years of age who could not read
          or write was 61 per cent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">productive industry</hi> of Italy presents considerable
          variety. Lombardy is the chief corngrowing
          state ; in Tuscany, the culture of fruit is
          much attended to ; the central parts are mainly
          pastoral ; and in Naples and Sicily, <q>the abundance of vegetable productions is more owing to the
          climate and soil than to the industry of the husbandman</q>.
          The culture of silk, the vine, and olive,
          are important. Fish form an important article of
          consumption ; and the tunny, anchovy, mullet,
          and other fisheries are conducted upon an extensive
          scale. The chief manufactures are those of silk
          fabrics, silk thread, &amp;c. which have their principal
          seat in Lombardy. The commerce of Italy has
          largely increased of late. In 1885, the total value
          her export trade was given at £47,250,238;
          that of the imports was a little more. There are
          over 5500 miles of Italian railway in use. In 1885
          the revenue, shewing, contrary to custom, a surplus,
          was £62,428,506 ; the debt was over £400,000,000.
          The war effective of the Italian army amounts to
          1,990,000 men, including militia. The <hi rend="itali">navy</hi> has
          nearly 120 ships of war, of which over 20 are ironclads,
          including several of the most powerful afloat.
          The population in 1881 amounted to 28,459,628.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Politically</hi>, Italy was long divided into a number of independent states, but since 1870, when
          the troops of Victor Emanuel took possession of
          the papal territories, it has become a single nation.
          Thee government is a limited monarchy, with two
          Houses, a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies;
          the latter elected by the people, the former,
          mainly nominated by the king for life. Rome, the
          capital, had in 1881 about 273,000 inhabitants.</p>

                <head>ROUMANIA, SERVIA, MONTENEGRO.</head>
                <p>The three <hi rend="italic">principalities</hi>, Roumania, Servia, and
          Montenegro, formerly subject to Turkey, secured
          the recognition of their independence at the
          Berlin Congress of 1878; and since 1882, Roumania
          and Servia are kingdoms.</p>
                <p>ROUMANIA, lying between the Danube and the
          Eastern Carpathians, which separate it from
          Austria, has an area of 45,000 square miles, and a
          population in 1880 of above 5,000,000. Both of
          its main divisions, Moldavia and Walachia, are
          fairly fertile. The inhabitants are a mixed race,
          descended partly from Roman colonists, and speak
          Roumansch, a language largely derived from
          Latin. The principality is a constitutional monarchy
          ; the creed is that of the Greek Church.</p>
                <p>SERVIA, partly highland and partly plain, lies
          south of the Danube; it has an area of 18,800
          square miles, and a population of 1,900,000. The
          people are of the Slavonic race, and, speaking a
          pure Slavonic tongue, belong mainly to the Greek
          faith. The king and his council are responsible
          to the Senate and Assembly.</p>
                <p>MONTENEGRO, chiefly a wild highland, just
          touches the Adriatic on its western border. The
          area is near 3550 square miles, and the population
          is estimated at 250,000. The people are
          Slavs of the Servian branch, and adhere to the
          Greek church. The prince is substantially an
          absolute monarch.</p>

                <head>TURKEY IN EUROPE.&gt;</head>
                <p>Turkey in Europe lies between lat. 39° and 48°
          north, and long. 16° and 29° east. It is bounded
          on the north by Austria, Servia, and Roumania ;
          east, by the Black Sea, Sea of Marmora, and the
          Archipelago ; south, by Greece ; and west, by
          the Ionian and Adriatic Seas. Since the Berlin
          treaty of 1878, when Montenegro, Servia, and
          Roumania became independent, Turkey in
          Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina (now
          occupied by Austria), the principality of Bulgaria,
          and the autonomous province of Eastern Roumelia,
          has an area of about 130,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>The chief mountain-range is the Balkan, the
          ancient Hasmus. Branching off from the Dinaric
          Alps, which separate the plains of Hungary from
          the Adriatic Gulf, it passes eastward to the Black
          Sea. The greatest known height is 9700 feet.
          North of the Balkan, Bulgaria, lying in the great
          valley of the Danube, consists mainly of rich alluvium.
          The country south of the Balkan is diversified
          by offsets from that range ; and a branch
          known in ancient times as the Pindus range is
          sent off southward into Greece. Between these
          southern offshoots of the Balkan are inclosed
          valleys and plains, often of great beauty and
          fertility. The <hi rend="italic">minerals</hi> of economical importance
          are marble ; iron, copper, lead, and silver ore;
          magnesia, meerschaum, and whetstones ; but
          mining, unless in Bosnia, is little attended to.</p>
                <p>As to climate, the flat provinces in the north
          have a hot and sultry summer ; the winter, on the
          other hand, is severe, and snow lies for fully five
          months on the mountains. South of the Balkan,
          the seasons are less marked, and the climate of
          the valleys is delightful. In Bosnia and the
          adjoining provinces, the cereals and other cultivated
          crops can be raised in any quantities on the
          plains, while the mountain-slopes are clad with
          forests of oak, elm, and pine. South of the
          Balkan, the country is covered with forests of the
          sycamore, plane, carob, box, and cypress ; gardens
          of roses, jasmine, and lilac ; vineyards and orchards
          of nearly all kinds of fruit-trees. In Thessaly -
          the garden of European Turkey - the olive, vine,
          fig, pomegranate, walnut, almond, orange, lemon,
          citron, cotton, tobacco, silk, &amp;c. are reared in perfection.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ruling people</hi> of the country are the Ottoman
          Turks or Osmanlis, an offshoot from the
          Tatars of Central Asia, who, between 1390 and 1470,
          conquered that part of the country lying within
          the confines of Europe. They form, however, but
          a small minority in the European portion of their
          empire. Of the 9 million inhabitants, they numbered,
          in 1880, only about 2 millions, the rest
          being Slavs, Albanians, Greeks, Armenians, and
          Jews. They have, however, imposed their Mussulman
          religion on 3 1/2 millions of the inhabitants,
          although the adherents of the Greek Church are
          nearly twice as numerous. There is some <hi rend="italic">education</hi>
          of a kind, but it is almost restricted to the
          reading of the Koran and its commentaries.</p>
                <p>Every branch of <hi rend="italic">industry</hi> is in a backward
          state in Turkey. <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> is in a very rude
          and even declining condition. Were the Turkish
          farmers and herdsmen secure from plunder and<pb n="23"/>extortion, the produce of the country might be ten
          times what it is ; still, so great is the fertility, that
          there is a surplus of corn for exportation. The
          grains chiefly cultivated are - maize, wheat, rye,
          barley, oats, and buckwheat ; the vine is grown
          in most of the provinces ; and flax, hemp, saffron,
          cotton, tobacco, madder, &amp;c. chiefly in the south.
          <hi rend="italic">Manufactures</hi>, of late years, have been depressed
          by foreign competition ; and the domestic
          weaving of cotton stuff for family use, and some
          silks at Constantinople and Salonica, are now
          almost the only branches of consequence. Commerce
          is carried on chiefly with Italy, Britain,
          Austria, Greece, and Russia, and centres in Constantinople.</p>
                <p>During the war with Russia in 1877-78, Turkey
          called into the ranks of its army no less than
          752,000 men, including reserves and irregular
          troops. In 1880, a partial re-organisation of
          the shattered military system had been carried
          through ; and the Turkish army was estimated to
          comprise 150,000 available men. The navy has
          been seriously crippled ; it counted in 1880 only
          some 18 vessels (formerly 80). The financial condition
          of Turkey has for years been on the verge
          of utter bankruptcy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> is an absolute monarchy or
          despotism, hereditary in the family of Osman, but
          restricted to males. The sultan, as calif, or successor
          of the prophet Mohammed, unites the
          highest spiritual dignity with the supreme secular
          power. The only limit to his will is the
          Koran, or Book of Mohammed (see <ref target="#MOHAMM">MOHAMMEDANISM</ref>),
          which he is bound by his oath
          of office to observe ; and this is in reality the
          source of all civil, political, or criminal law. The
          legislative and executive authority is exercised
          under the supreme direction of the Sultan by two
          high dignitaries, the <hi rend="italic">Sadr-azam</hi>, or Grand Vizier,
          the head of the temporal government, and the
          <hi rend="italic">Sheik-ul-Islam</hi>, or Head of the Church. Both
          are appointed by the sovereign, the latter with
          the nominal concurrence of the <hi rend="italic">Ulema</hi>, a body
          comprising the clergy and chief functionaries of
          the law. The <hi rend="italic">Divan</hi>, or Ministerial Council, has
          eight portfolios. All offices of state are open to
          the humblest subjects. Since 1856, religious
          toleration has been the law of the land. Capital,

                <head>GREECE.</head>
                <p>This country, whose ancient history is so intimately
          associated with much that is refined and
          noble in human progress, occupies the south-east
          extremity of Europe, commonly distinguished as
          the Hellenic Peninsula. It is surrounded by the
          Mediterranean, except on the north, where it is
          bounded by Turkey, of which, till 1821, it formed
          one of the component sections. Its area, with
          the recent additions, is about 25,000 square miles,
          of which about three-fifths are cultivable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">physical aspect</hi> of the country is decidedly
          mountainous and rugged ; its hills, though seldom
          rising above 5500 feet (Guiona, the culminating
          point of Greece, is 8783 feet; Parnassus, 8068 feet;
          and St Elias - anc. Taygetus - in the Morea, 7900
          feet), being so abrupt and craggy as to assume
          an appearance more majestic and imposing than
          many others of double the altitude. Rising and
          radiating in every direction, the hills occupy fully
          three-fifths of the surface, leaving the remainder
          in narrow defiles, glens, and basin-shaped valleys,
          which severally formed the sites of the numerous
          petty states into which ancient Greece was divided.
          The mineral products are - marble of various
          colours, porphyry, slate, coal, gypsum, sulphur,
          alum, asphalt, zinc, lead, iron, gold, silver, copper,
          manganese, and cobalt ; none of which, however,
          are obtained in important quantities.</p>
                <p>Considerable <hi rend="italic">diversity of climate</hi> is experienced,
          in consequence of the varied altitude of the
          country, and the manner in which it is intersected
          by bays, gulfs, hills, and valleys. No portion
          reaches the snow-line, but snow annually falls on
          the higher hills, where it often lies for weeks
          together. The vegetable and animal products of
          continental Greece are quite analogous to those
          of Southern Italy and Turkish Thessaly, already
          described.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dominant people</hi> are the Hellenes or Greeks, who chiefly inhabit the eastern and central parts,
          and who boast of descent from the Greeks of
          classic times. Their language is the Romaic, a
          modernised form of the ancient Greek, to which
          it bears a much closer resemblance than the
          Italian does to the Latin. The other inhabitants
          are Albanians, occupying the greater part of
          Livadia and part of the Morea ; and Walachs,
          descended from a colony from Walachia. The
          established or national religion is that of the
          <q>Orthodox Oriental Apostolic</q>, or Greek Church,
          having the sovereign for its head, and governed
          (since 1833) by a holy synod, consisting of five
          members annually elected by the dignitaries from
          their own number. The only other ritual observed
          to any extent is that of the Roman Catholic, and
          this more especially in the Ionian Islands and the
          Cyclades. <hi rend="italic">Educationally</hi>, Greece is still in a
          backward state, but the government is doing a
          good deal to improve it. The public schools are
          of four grades—the <hi rend="italic">communal</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">ancient Greek</hi>,
          the <hi rend="italic">gymnasium</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">university</hi>. In 1880,
          the educational returns gave 1200 teachers, with
          91,000 pupils. Besides the schools already mentioned,
          there are schools of medicine, and theological,
          military, and naval academies. The two
          universities are those of Athens and Corfu. Athens
          possesses a university, with a numerous staff of
          professors and a library, and also a Polytechnic
          School.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">productive industry</hi> of the country differs
          little from that of the southern parts of Turkey,
          already described. The vine and currant-grape
          are extensively cultivated ; the latter, indeed,
          forms the staple article of export. In 1881, the
          value of the currant trade with Great Britain
          amounted to £1,656,000. The other fruits are
          more the gift of nature than the results of culture.
          The manufactures are mostly domestic and quite
          inconsiderable ; fishing is largely carried on. The
          Greeks are remarkable for commercial enterprise ;
          and a great part of the Mediterranean trade is in
          their hands. Their commercial fleet numbered
          in 1882, 6790 vessels, of a burden of near 300,000
          tons. The <hi rend="italic">railway system</hi> embraces short lines
          from Athens to the Piraeus and in Thessaly ; and
          others are in progress.</p>
                <p>Greece formed a part of the Turkish empire till
          1821, when the people revolted, and after a long
          and severe struggle, succeeded, with the aid of<pb n="24"/>
          England, France, and Russia, in achieving their
          independence. The country was accordingly
          formed into the new kingdom of Hellas, and
          Otho, a prince of Bavaria, appointed king. Otho
          abdicated in 1862, and was succeeded by Prince
          George of Denmark. The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> is a constitutional
          monarchy, the legislature consisting of a
          senate and chamber of representatives. The
          administration is corrupt and inefficient, and
          brigandage is prevalent. During King George's
          reign, the average duration of ministries is less
          than a year. The population, according to the
          census of 1879, amounted to 1,979,423; the
          revenue is about two millions; debt, 15 millions
          sterling; army, 30,000 men; navy, 15 vessels (2
          iron-clads) manned by 2700 men. Capital, Athens,
          with a population, in 1884, of 84,000.</p>

                <head>AUSTRO-HUNGARY.</head>
                <p>The Austro-Hungarian Empire occupies a large
          portion of Central Europe, and consists of an agregation
          of kingdoms, principalities, and duchies,
          acquired at various times by treaty or by conquest;
          but though composed of a heterogeneous assemblage
          of tribes and nations, it lies compactly
          together, and is situated between lat. 42° and 51°
          north, and long. 9° 41' and 26° 30' east. Its area
          estimated at 240,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">natural features</hi> of the empire exhibit wide
          and well-marked diversity of hill and plain. Of
          the former, the principal are - the Alpine development
          of the Tyrol, which, under the title of the
          Carnic, Julian, and other ridges, diverges into
          Illyria and Styria ; the eastern and western Carpathians,
          which encircle the whole of Hungary
          and Transylvania north of the Danube ; and
          lastly, the Riesengebirge, Erzgebirge, and Böhmerwald
          ranges, which, inclosing Bohemia, form
          the boundary with Saxony and Bavaria. In the
          western or Germanic provinces of the empire,
          there are a number of fine valleys, watered by such
          rivers as the Inn, Enns, Moldau, March, Muhr,
          and Drave ; while in Galicia and Hungary expand
          some of those vast plains which give character to
          this region of Europe.</p>
                <p>The country abounds in <hi rend="italic">minerals</hi>, and mining
          has long been practised and encouraged by the
          government. Gold and silver are mined in Hungary
          and Transylvania ; quicksilver at Idria in
          Carniola ; iron, lead, tin, and copper are abundant
          ; calamine, zinc, cobalt, antimony, bismuth,
          manganese, and almost every other metal can be
          procured. There are also abundant supplies of
          rock-salt, as at Wieliczka ; marble, coal, alum,
          saltpetre, and sulphur.</p>
                <p>In point of <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, the country is generally
          divided into three regions. 1. The southern,
          extending from lat. 42 to 46° north, where are
          found the fig-tree, olive, mulberry, and myrtle.
          2. The middle region, from lat. 46° to 49° north,
          where the olive is not found, but where maize
          and vines thrive in favourable situations. 3. The
          northern zone, extending from lat. 49° to 51° north,
          where winter is severe, and lasts fully five months ;
          where vines and maize are no longer met with,
          but wheat, barley, oats, and rye form the usual
          crops. The forests of Austria are very extensive,
          forming about a fourth part of the surface, and
          comprising all the timber-trees known in England.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">population</hi> of Austria, amounting, in 1880,
          to 37,900,000, embraces a great variety of peoples
          distinct in origin and language. The most
          numerous are the <hi rend="italic">Slaves</hi>, stated at 16,200,000.
          They form the bulk of the population of Bohemia,
          Moravia, Carniola, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia,
          the Military Frontiers, the north of Hungary and
          Galicia. The <hi rend="italic">Germans</hi> number 9,840,000, or one-fifth
          of the whole. They are more dispersed over
          the empire than any other race ; but they occupy
          in greater numbers the Duchy of Austria, Salzburg,
          Tyrol, Styria, Carinthia, and the west of Hungary.
          The <hi rend="italic">Roumans</hi> - speaking languages derived from
          that of ancient Rome - amount to 31 millions.
          They consist of the Italians of Istria and Dalmatia;
          the Ladins, occupying some valleys in the Tyrol
          and the Vallaks or Walachians of Transylvania,
          &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">Magyars</hi> or Hungarians proper, 6,430,000
          in number, are located chiefly in Hungary and
          Transylvania. Besides these leading races, there
          are Armenians, Albanians, Gipsies, Jews, whose
          combined numbers are estimated at 1,350,000.</p>
                <p>In respect of <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, 2 1/2 millions of the inhabitants
          (66 per cent.) belong to the dominant
          church, the Roman Catholic ; the Greek and
          Armenian churches, including those Greeks who
          acknowledge the supremacy of the pope, 7 millions;
          the Protestants, 3 1/2 millions; and Jews, 1,600,000.
          The extensive powers formerly secured to the
          Roman Catholic clergy by a special concordat
          (1855) with the pontifical government, were all
          swept away by the Reichsrath in 1867-68, and at
          present throughout the empire the law recognises
          the perfect equality of all religious creeds. In
          1880, the Catholic Church in Austria had 11 archbishops,
          51 bishops, and more than 30,000 secular
          priests.</p>
                <p>Of late years, since the rapid growth of liberal
          opinion in Austria, education has made great
          progress. Naturally, the German provinces stand
          foremost in this honourable work. Primary education
          is universal and compulsory, but the variety
          of languages spoken in the country embarrasses
          and impedes the operation of the law. Sometimes
          three or four are required in one school.
          There are 9 universities—Vienna, Prague, Pesth,
          Gratz, Innsbrück, Cracow, and 3 minor ones.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Industrially</hi>, Austria is more an agricultural
          and pastoral than a manufacturing country. It furnishes
          wheat and other bread-corns in abundance;
          fruits, wine, hops, hemp, flax, tobacco, saffron, and
          dye-stuffs ; hides, horns, wax, honey, silk, and
          other animal produce. Bohemia and Moravia
          have long been celebrated for their manufactures
          in woollens, linens, cottons, leather, glass, hardware,
          and fire-arms. The <hi rend="italic">mineral</hi> produce has
          been already adverted to ; and, <hi rend="italic">commercially</hi>,
          Trieste is a place of great importance. Austria
          possesses magnificently constructed roads, leading
          throughout the chief provinces ; has several well-kept
          canals of considerable length; and in 1872,
          7530 miles of railway, and 22,700 miles of telegraph,
          besides its great navigable rivers, the Maros,
          Theiss, Drave, Po, and Danube, on the last of
          which, passengers and goods are conveyed by
          steam between Ulm and Galatz, and on to Constantinople.</p>
                <p>Since 1867, the Austro-Hungarian empire has
          formed a double state, consisting of a German or
          <q>Cisleithan</q> (so called from the river Leitha, which
          runs near the Hungarian border), and a Hungarian
          or <q>Transleithan</q> monarchy. Each country has<pb n="25"/>its own parliament, ministers, and government,
          and is so far self-regulative ; but there is also a
          higher parliament, composed of delegates from
          both parts of the empire, whose decisions are
          final on imperial questions, such as foreign diplomacy,
          war, &amp;c. The form of government is now
          essentially <hi rend="italic">constitutional</hi>, and, as far as liberal
          reforms can give solid unity to a heterogeneous
          mass of peoples, the thing is being done in Austria.</p>
                <p>In 1881, the revenue of the empire, and of
          Austria and of Hungary, was nearly £90,000,000;
          and its expenditure, £80,000,000 The debt in the
          same year amounted to £470,000,000. The <hi rend="italic">army</hi>
          in 1882 numbered 268,470 on the peace, and
          1,031,700 on the war footing. The <hi rend="italic">navy</hi> consisted
          of 50 steamers (13 iron-clads), and 10 sailingvessels.
          Pola and Trieste are the two Austrian
          war-harbours. Capital, Vienna, with 1,103,000

                <head>GERMANY.</head>
                <p>Germany, so called from the Latin <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>,
          is the English name of the country which the
          natives call Deutschland, and the French, L'Allemagne.
          The word is sometimes employed to
          denote the whole area of the European continent
          within which the Germanic race and language
          are dominant. In this broad sense, it includes,
          besides Germany proper, parts of Austria, Switzerland,
          and perhaps even of the Netherlands ;
          but using the word here to denote the territory
          belonging to the new Germanic empire of 1871,
          it may be said that Germany occupies the central
          portions of Europe, and extends from 6° to 22°
          40' east longitude ; and from 49° 7' to 55° 50'
          north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the
          Danish peninsula, the German Ocean, and the
          Baltic ; on the east, by Russia and Austria ; on
          the south, by Austria, Italy, and Switzerland ; and
          on the west, by France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
          Its area is estimated at 208,000 square
          miles, and its population, in 1880, at 45,234,000.</p>
                <p>With regard to physical configuration, Germany
          presents two very distinct formations : 1. A range
          of high table-land, occupying the centre and
          southern parts of the country, interspersed with
          numerous ranges and groups of mountains, the
          most important of which are, the Harz and
          Teutoburgerwald, in the north ; the Taunus and
          Thuringerwald, in the middle ; and the Schwarzwald
          and Rauhe Alps, in the south ; and containing
          an area, including Alsace and Lorraine,
          of 110,000 square miles. 2. A vast sandy plain,
          which extends from the centre of the empire north
          to the German Ocean, and the boundaries of
          Jütland, and including Slesvig-Holstein, contains
          an area of 98,000 square miles. This great plain,
          stretching from the Russian frontier on the east,
          to the Netherlands on the west, is varied by two
          terrace-like elevations. The one stretches from
          the Vistula into Mecklenburg, at no great distance
          from the coast of the Baltic, and has a mean
          elevation of 500 to 600 feet, rising in one point
          near Danzig to 1020 feet ; the other line of elevations
          begins in Silesia, and terminates in the
          moorlands of Lüneburg in Hanover, its course
          being marked by several summits from 500 to
          800 feet in height. A large part of this sandy
          tract is interspersed with deposits of peat ; but
          other parts are moderately fertile, and admit of
          successful cultivation. In respect of drainage,
          the surface of Germany belongs to three different
          basins—(1.) The Danube, from its source
          in the Black Forest to the borders of Austria,,
          belongs to Germany, and through this channel
          the waters of the greater part of Bavaria are
          poured into the Black Sea ; thus opening up communication
          with the East. (2.) The North Sea.
          {3.) The Baltic. The chief German streams flowing;
          into the North Sea are the Rhine, the Weser, and
          the Elbe ; into the Baltic, the Oder and the
          Vistula. The most important of the numerous
          canals which connect together the great river
          systems of Germany are Ludwig's Canal in
          Bavaria, which unites the Danube and Main, and
          thus opens a communication between the Black
          Sea and German Ocean ; the Finow and Friedrich-
          Wilhelm's Canals in Brandenburg ; the Plaue
          Canal, which connects the Elbe and the Havel ;
          and the Kiel and Eyder Canal, uniting the Baltic
          and German Ocean. Numerous lakes occur both
          in the table-land of Southern Germany and in
          the lowlands of the northern districts, but few
          of them are of any great size. Germany abounds
          in swamps and marsh lands, which are especially
          numerous in the low northern districts. Its mineral
          springs occur principally in Nassau, Würtemberg,
          Baden, Bavaria, and Rhenish Prussia.
          Many of these springs have retained their high
          reputation from the earliest ages.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> of Germany is said to be <q>less
          variable than the nature of its mountain-system,
          and the ranges of latitude within which it lies,
          would lead us to imagine ; and its vegetation
          resembles in its general character that of England
          or the north of France</q>. Germany is rich in
          mineral products, among which the most important
          are silver, found in the Harz Mountains ; iron
          in numerous mountain ranges ; salt in many parts
          of the country ; coal in Rhenish Prussia and
          Silesia. Cobalt, arsenic, sulphur, saltpetre, alum,
          gypsum, bismuth, pumice-stone, tripoli-slate,
          kaolin, emery, ochre, and vitriol are all among the
          exports of Germany. The vegetable products
          comprise a very large proportion of European
          flora. All the ordinary cereals are extensively
          cultivated in the north, and largely exported ;
          hemp and flax, madder, woad, and safifron grow
          well in the central districts, where the vine, the
          cultivation of which extends in suitable localities
          as far north as 51°, is brought to great perfection —the best wine-producing districts being the
          valleys of the Danube, Rhine, Main, Neckar, and
          Moselle, which are, moreover, noted for the excellence
          of their fruits and vegetables. Tobacco is
          grown in sufficient quantities for extensive exportation
          on the Upper Rhine, Werra, and Oder.
          The hops of Bavaria have a high reputation, and
          the chicory grown in that country, and in the district
          between the Elbe and the Weser, finds its
          way all over Europe as a substitute for coffee.
          The most extensive forests are found in Central
          Germany, and in some parts of Prussia, while the
          north-western parts of the great plain are deficient
          in wood, the place of which is in some degree
          supplied by the abundance of turf yielded by the
          marshy lands. Germany has long been noted for
          its good breed of horses, while Saxony, Silesia,
          and Brandenburg have an equal reputation for
          their sheep-flocks, and the fine quality of their
          wool. The rich alluvial flats of Mecklenburg and<pb n="26"/>Hanover are celebrated for their cattle ; the
          forests abound in swine and small game, while
          the Bavarian Alps afford shelter to the larger
          animals, as the chamois, red-deer, wild goat, fox,
          marten, and wolf ; and in all the plains of the
          north, storks, wild geese, and ducks are abundant.
          Germany stands next to Great Britain in regard
          to the care and success with which its agricultural,
          mining, and other natural capabilities have been
          cultivated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">people</hi> are mainly of Germanic (Deutsch)
          origin, speaking various dialects of High and
          Low German ; but using the former as a written
          medium. Other races are - French and Walloons,
          on the Rhine and in Lorraine ; Slaves (including
          Poles, Wends, and Czechs) in the east ; Danes in
          the north ; and a number of Jews in the principal
          cities. Lutheran and Calvinistic Protestantism,
          with Roman Catholicism, divide among them the
          great bulk of the people—the former having 28
          millions of adherents ; the latter, 16 millions ; the
          rest are Jews, Moravian Brethren, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Education</hi>
          is more generally diffused in Germany than in
          any other country of Europe, and is cultivated
          with an earnest and systematic devotion not met
          with to an equal extent among other nations.
          The elementary schools are so general, that none
          but the wilfully ignorant, or those of imperfect
          faculties, can be unacquainted with reading, writing,
          and the first rules of arithmetic. The schools
          for classical instruction, denominated gymnasiums,
          pedagogiums, and lyceums, are found in almost
          every large town, and dispense learning at a
          very cheap rate. The universities are numerous
          (twenty-one within the new Germanic empire), and
          provide the most liberal and various instruction
          in the higher branches of knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Industrially</hi>, the Germans are a thrifty, plodding
          people. Their agriculture and husbandry are
          of a tidy and domestic character. Their <hi rend="italic">mines</hi>
          have been long conducted upon correct and
          scientific principles. The principal <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>
          are those of linen, in Silesia, Lusatia, and Westphalia
          ; woollen, in Saxony, Rhenish Prussia,
          Pomerania, and Bavaria ; cotton, in Saxony and
          Rhenish Prussia ; toys, in the hilly districts of
          Saxony, Bavaria, and the Black Forest ; glass, in
          Silesia; porcelain, at Berlin and Meissen; clocks,
          in the Black Forest ; tobacco, at Hamburg and
          Bremen, &amp;c. Germany exports grain, wood,
          cattle, horses, wax, wine, beer, woollen, linen, and
          cotton goods, glass, hardware, &amp;c. ; and imports
          sugar, coffee, tea, rice, cotton, &amp;c. Internal communication
          is carried on by navigable rivers,
          canals, and roads. In 1882, there were over
          22,000 miles of railway within the Germanic
          empire, and 45,000 miles of telegraphic lines.</p>
                <p>Since 1871, Germany has been an empire,
          composed of a confederation of German states,
          but welded together, for national purposes, into
          one great power, governed by the king of Prussia,
          who is hereditary German emperor ; and represented
          by two legislative bodies—the <hi rend="italic">Bundesrath</hi>,
          or Federal Council, the members of which are
          annually appointed by the governments of the
          various states ; and the <hi rend="italic">Reichstag</hi>, or Imperial
          Diet, the members of which are elected by universal
          suffrage and ballot for a period of three
          years. With the consent of these two bodies, the
          German emperor can declare war, make peace,
          enter into treaties with foreign nations, and
          appoint and receive ambassadors. The empire
          comprises four kingdoms (Prussia, Bavaria,
          Saxony, and Würtemberg), six grand-duchies, five
          duchies, seven principalities, three free cities, and
          the imperial territory of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>
                <p>The revenue of the empire, apart from the
          revenues of the several states which comprise it,
          was in 1882 nearly £30,000,000, and the debt
          £18,000,000. The army had then on the peacefooting
          a strength of 450,000 men, and on the warfooting
          1,500,000. The navy, formed under
          Prussian auspices, has grown rapidly, till in 1882
          it comprised 24 iron-clads, 58 other steamers,
          besides some sailing-vessels. The total imports of
          Germany in 1877 had a value of £193,350,000,
          and in 1878, £186,150,000; the exports in 1877,
          £134,760,000, and in 1878, £145,820,000. Between
          1872 and 1879, the annual imports from Great
          Britain ranged in value from £19,500,000 to-
          £31,618,000, the greatest value being in 1872; the
          exports to Great Britain ranged in annual value
          during the same years from £19,230,000 to
          £26,270,000, the greatest value of exports beings
          in 1877. The mercantile navy of Germany comprised,
          in 1879, 4804 sea-going ships, of 1,129,129
          tons burden - 351 of them being steamers, with
          a tonnage of 179,662 tons.</p>

                <head>HOLLAND, OR THE NETHERLANDS.</head>
                <p>This is one of the secondary kingdoms of
          Europe, lying along the south-eastern shores of
          the German Sea, which, from their uniformly low
          and level character, are generally known to geographers
          as the Netherlands. Its area is estimated
          at 12,650 square miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Superficially</hi>, the whole country, saving some
          slight elevations in Gelderland, Utrecht, and
          Overyssel, forms one unbroken flat, without
          forests, or, except in the south part, running
          waters ; the land consisting mainly of moor,
          marsh, and meadow land, traversed by numerous canals,
          which, while they are absolutely necessary
          to drain it, and render it fit for cultivation, answer
          for the most part the purposes of roads - many of
          them being navigable for large vessels. In many
          places, the level of the surface actually falls from
          twenty to forty feet below that of the sea, against
          which it is protected partly, as in Zealand, Friesland,
          and Gelderland, by enormous dikes, and
          partly, as between the Helder and the Hook of
          Holland, by sandhills or <hi rend="italic">dunes</hi>, cast up by the
          ocean upon the shores.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, as might be expected from the
          situation and lowness of the country, as well as
          from the number of water-courses which intersect
          its surface, is generally moist and foggy. In
          winter, Holland experiences a much lower temperature
          than the opposite coast of England - the
          river-mouths and canals being covered with ice
          often for three months together.</p>
                <p>The natural <hi rend="italic">vegetation</hi> is of the scantiest
          description : there are no forests, and only a few
          plantations of oak, beech, and elm, clumps of
          pine on the links or sand-drift, and rows of willow
          and poplar along the banks of the canals. The
          principal cultivated plants are - wheat, oats, and
          barley ; buckwheat, and the leguminous crops in
          smaller quantities ; potatoes to a great, and flax,
          hemp, tobacco to a considerable extent ; madder,
          rape-seed, chicory, mustard, and beet ; tulips<pb n="27"/>hyacinths, lilies, dahlias, and other garden flowers,
          for which the country around Haarlem has long
          been celebrated.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi>, about three-fourths are Hollanders
          or Dutch, speaking that dialect of Low-German which, of all modern Teutonic tongues,
          has retained most of the primitive characteristics ;
          the Frisians, also a Low-German race, whose
          speech was anciently spread over almost the
          whole country, but is now confined to parts of
          North Friesland ; the High-Germans in Luxemburg
          and Limburg, and Walloons in Limburg.
          As to <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, the majority of the people are
          Calvinistic Protestants ; the minority consisting
          mainly of Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Jews.
          There is, however, no dominant sect in the
          country : all forms of faith and ritual are alike
          tolerated ; the clergy are indiscriminately maintained
          by the state ; the universities are upheld in
          the same manner, and these are open to students
          of all sects, whose theological studies are conducted 
          under professors of their own creed. Education
          is spreading rapidly throughout the kingdom, 
          through the operation of the Primary Instruction 
          Law of 1857, but even yet it is calculated
          that in the rural districts one-fourth of the men
          and one-third of the women can neither read nor
          write. According to the government returns in
          1880, the number of pupils in the public schools
          amounted to 408,000, and in the private schools
          to 137,000. There are about 100 secondary
          schools. A new university has been founded at
          Amsterdam; and the universities of Leyden,
          Utrecht, and Groningen, once famous, are again
          attracting the notice of Europe by the liberality
          and learning of their professors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Industrially</hi> and <hi rend="italic">commercially</hi> the Dutch have
          long been celebrated. The nature of their <hi rend="italic">agricultural</hi>
          produce has been already adverted to ;
          and the careful, cleanly style in which they cultivate
          the soil and manage their dairies, as well as
          the manner in which they embank and drain their
          low plots or <hi rend="italic">polders</hi>, are beyond all praise. The
          chief <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi> are those of woollen, in
          Leyden and Utrecht ; silks, in Utrecht, Haarlem,
          and Amsterdam ; calicoes, shirtings, drills, tablecloths,
          and dimities, in the town of Overyssel;
          tobacco-pipes at Gouda ; and paper, leather,
          sugar-refining, painters' colours, and cordage, at
          various other places. The distilling of gin is extensively
          conducted at Schiedam. Delft, and Rotterdam
          ; and ship-building at the ports of Rotterdam
          and Amsterdam. The trade of the Netherlands
          is chiefly carried on with Germany and
          Great Britain, and is rapidly increasing year by
          year. In 1867, its imports were valued at
          £44,500,000, and its exports at £36,400,000 ; in
          1880, they had risen respectively to over
          £69,000,000 and £52,000,000.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, since the establishment of
          peace in 1815, has been a constitutional hereditary
          monarchy. The legislative power is vested in the
          sovereign and the States-general, which consists
          of two chambers - the first, of thirty-nine members,
          elected by the provincial assemblies ; the second,
          of a representative for every 45,000 inhabitants,
          which, in 1881, gave 86 members, all of whom are
          paid. Population in 1881, 4,114,000; the revenue
          of late years has averaged about £9,000,000; the
          expenditure has generally been a little less. In
          1882, the national debt was £78, 500,000; the
          army at the same date was 62,000; the navy
          consisted of 103 steamers, of which 17 were ironclads.

                <head>BELGIUM.</head>
                <p>Belgium, another of the lesser kingdoms of
          Europe, is situated between lat. 49° 27' and 51°
          31' north, and long. 2° 33' and 6° 5' east ; and is
          bounded on the north by Holland ; east, by
          Rhenish Prussia, Dutch Limburg, and Luxemburg
          ; south, by France and Germany ; and
          west, by the German Ocean. Area, 11,372 square
          miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Superficially</hi>, the northern and western provinces
          of Belgium, in their flatness, fertility, dikes,
          and canals, may be regarded as a continuation of
          Holland - with this difference, that in no part
          does the surface fall beneath the level of the sea.
          The south and east provinces have an opposite
          character ; they are generally more thinly peopled,
          less cultivated, and exhibit an irregular hilly
          surface, with tracts of marshy land and extensive
          forests. The country is intersected by numerous
          streams - the affluents of the navigable rivers
          Meuse, Sambre, Dender, Scheldt, Lys, &amp;c. The
          chief mineral products of Liege, Namur, Hainault,
          and Luxemburg are - coal, iron, lead, copper, and
          zinc ; besides which may be mentioned manganese,
          calamine, alum, various kinds of stone, slate,
          marble, whet-hones, and porcelain clay. Of the
          <hi rend="italic">mineral springs</hi> arising from these formations, the
          most celebrated are those of Spa.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> resembles that of the south-east of
          England, but is, on the whole, more humid and
          variable ; some districts, moreover, as Flanders,
          being at certain seasons rendered unhealthy by
          noxious exhalations from the water-courses and
          low polder-lands. The <hi rend="italic">vegetation</hi>, both natural
          and cultivated, is the same as that of England
          and the north of France.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi>, about two-thirds, inhabiting
          the northern provinces, are Flemings, an offshoot
          of the great Teutonic stem, and speaking a
          language resembling Dutch. The south-eastern
          provinces are inhabited by Walloons, who are
          Celts like the French, and speak dialects (Walloon
          and Picard) of the French language. French is
          the language of the educated classes. In regard
          to <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, nineteen-twentieths of the people are
          Roman Catholics. There are not more than
          15,000 Protestants, and perhaps about 3000 Jews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Education</hi> is almost entirely in the hands of the
          Jesuits. The colleges of that order have more
          pupils than the royal athenaeums and other upper
          and middle class schools ; while the Roman
          Catholic university of Louvain has twice as many
          students as the two state universities put together.
          Elementary education is not yet generally diffused,
          but is growing.</p>
                <p>At present, the <hi rend="italic">industry</hi> of Belgium is happily
          distributed between agriculture, mining, and manufactures.
          The Belgian or Flemish system of agriculture
          is well known over Europe for its minute
          and careful management ; and no people understand
          better the method of collecting and preparing
          every species of manure, without which much
          of their sandy soil would be next to worthless.
          Half the surface of the country is under tillage.
          The mines of Belgium are an important source of<pb n="28"/>wealth. The amount of coal raised annually is
          about 16,000,000 tons, and the number of men
          employed is over 100,000. The most important
          manufactures are - woollen cloths, at Verviers,
          Liege, Ypres; carpets, at Tournay; linens, at
          Bruges, Courtray, Ghent, Termonde, &amp;c. ; cotton
          goods, at Ghent, Bruges, Courtray, Mechlin,
          Louvain, Tournay, Mons, and Antwerp; superb
          lace, at Brussels and Mechlin; ribbons, at
          Antwerp, Tournay, Ypres; metallurgy, at Charleroi,
          Liege, Namur, &amp;c. ; steam-engines, firearms,
          and machinery, at Liege ; hardwares and
          cutlery in various localities ; porcelain, at Brussels,
          &amp;c.; glass, at Namur, Liege, and Charleroi. The
          internal communication of the country is carried
          on by means of the rivers, already noticed, a
          number of well-kept canals, good macadamised
          roads, and a partly national system of railways,
          which in 1882 had a length of 2600 miles.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, as established in 1831, is a
          constitutional, hereditary monarchy. The legislative
          power is exercised collectively by the king, senate, and house of representatives - the members
          of both of these chambers being elected by all
          citizens who pay a small amount of direct taxes.
          The executive is exercised by the sovereign,
          assisted by responsible ministers. Population,
          5,520,000; revenue (in 1882), £12,000,000; debt,
          £72,000,000 ; imports (in 1881), £112,000,000, and
          exports, £98,500,000; army, on the war-footing,
          100,000 - on peace-footing, 40,000. Capital,

                <head>DENMARK.</head>
                <p>This small but ancient kingdom occupies the
          greater part of that peninsular and insular portion
          of Europe betwixt the German Ocean and the
          entrance to the Baltic Sea ; and lies between lat.
          54° 35' and 57° 42' north, and long. 8° 5' and 12°
          45' east. The Danish dominions consist of the
          kingdom of Denmark proper, which includes the
          peninsula of Jütland, with the islands of Sjaeland
          or Zealand, Funen, Laaland, Falster, Möen, Langland,
          &amp;c. The area is 14,740 square miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Superficially</hi>, both the peninsular and insular
          portions are low and flat ; in many places rising
          little above the sea, and requiring the protection
          of mounds and dikes ; and in no portion exceeding
          an altitude of 1200 feet. In the north and
          west of Jütland, large sandy tracts are prevalent,
          partially covered with bent, heath, and juniper,
          and utterly unavailable for culture. The soil of
          the islands is composed of calcareous sand and
          clay, and is, upon the whole, of average quality.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, in consequence of the low-lying
          nature of the land, and the proximity of the surrounding
          seas to its most central portions, is, on
          the whole, much milder than the latitude would
          indicate. The distinguishing characteristics are
          humidity and changeableness. All the common
          grasses, rye, wheat, oats, potatoes, hemp, flax,
          and rape-seed, are raised ; and in several of the
          islands are large orchard-growths of apples, pears,
          cherries, and hazel-nuts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">people</hi> belong to the Scandinavian branch
          of the great Teutonic family, and speak a modern
          form of the old Norse, which is much simpler in
          structure, and more musical in sound than its
          venerable parent. Lutheranism is the established
          <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> of the state, and according to the census
          of 1880 was professed by all but 17,000 of the
          people. Elementary education is widely diffused,
          attendance at school being obligatory from the
          age of seven to fourteen. Almost every one can
          read and write. Besides the university of Copenhagen,
          there are thirteen gymnasia in Denmark,
          where classics are taught, and a large number of
          what the Germans call <hi rend="italic">real-schulen</hi>. The parish
          or elementary schools are nearly 3000 in number.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Industrially</hi>, Denmark is more an agricultural
          and pastoral than a manufacturing country. Its
          commerce consists almost exclusively in barley,
          wheat and oats, cattle and butter. The total
          value of the exports in 1880 was £12,650,000.
          They consist mainly of butter, grain, and cattle;
          and nearly half go to Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> is a hereditary monarchy. The
          constitution of 1849 gives an elective parliament,
          or <hi rend="italic">Rigsdag</hi>, for the whole kingdom, consisting of
          two houses, a Folkething and a Landsthing, the
          latter forming a Senate or Upper House. Since
          1866, Slesvig and Holstein have ceased to be
          Danish provinces, and now form part of Prussia,
          Population (in 1880), 1,969,000; revenue (in 1881),

                <p>This country occupies the eastern and more
          important section of the Scandinavian peninsula,
          and is situated between lat. 55° 20' and 69° north,
          and long. 11° 10' and 24° east. Its extreme length
          is about 965 miles, and its average breadth 188 :
          the area is computed at 172,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Physically</hi>, the country presents several districts
          of very different aspect ; the whole, however,
          declining from the Kjölen and Dofrine ranges
          towards the basin of the Baltic. Starting with
          these, which have the character of an irregular
          table-land, about 20 or 25 miles across, and only
          at intervals studded with mountains of more than
          5000 feet high, we find the general elevation
          between 2000 and 2800 feet, covered with straggling
          forests of pine and birch. From this tract
          the country descends by steps or terraces.
          Throughout the whole of these, the rivers which
          rise in the mountain-plateau hold on their course,
          presenting numerous rapids and water-falls ; only
          a few of them, as the Angermans, being navigable
          during the lower stages of their descent. Such
          is the superficial character of Nordland. As we
          travel southward through Svealand, the face of
          the country becomes flat, or only diversified by
          the insignificant ridges which inclose the great
          lakes Wener, Wetter, &amp;c. South of the lakes,
          the greater part of Gothland presents the same
          low and sandy character as the opposite coast of
          Denmark. The most important <hi rend="italic">mineral products</hi>
          are - iron (the best in Europe), copper, and lead
          in abundance ; cobalt, zinc, antimony, gold, and
          silver in minor quantities.</p>
                <p>Respecting <hi rend="italic">climate</hi>, Nordland, part of which
          lies within the Arctic Circle, has from five to six
          months of winter ; snow and ice then covering
          the mountains and rivers, and locking up the
          waters of the Gulf of Bothnia. On the other hand,
          the summer is sudden and short, but excessively<pb n="29"/>warm ; at midsummer, the sun never falls beneath
          the horizon north of Tornea ; and the crops of
          oats and barley come to maturity in six or eight
          weeks. In the central parts, winter lasts only
          about four months, but is severe enough in most
          seasons to lock up the Baltic ; and in the southern
          level tracts, the climate is very similar to that of
          Northern Germany.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vegetable productions</hi>, as might be expected
          from the high latitude and natural poverty of the
          soil, are by no means abundant. In the forests,
          pines, firs, alders, and birches are prevalent in the
          north ; these, with oak, elm, and ash in the central
          districts ; and the beech, chestnut, mulberry,
          &amp;c. only in the south. Apples, pears, and other
          garden-fruits are grown in Gothland. The cultivated
          products consist chiefly of rye, barley, oats,
          wheat, potatoes, peas, hemp and flax, buckwheat,
          madder, hops, and woad, in the south ; but as we
          proceed northward, most of these disappear, and
          oats, barley, maslin (a mixture of barley and oats),
          and potatoes, are alone cultivated - oats ripening
          so far as 66° north, and a coarse variety of barley
          even to the limits of the pine-woods in 69° 30'.
          The principal <hi rend="italic">wild animals</hi> are - the bear, wolf,
          wolverine, fox, lynx, badger, otter, squirrel, lemming,
          and other small rodents ; with a few scattered
          members of the beaver family. Game-birds
          are everywhere rife, from the partridge to the
          capercailzie ; and aquatic birds appear in great
          abundance. Seals and porpoises are found in
          the Baltic, whose waters also furnish plentiful
          supplies of cod, sole, turbot, pilchard, herring,
          stremming, mackerel, oysters, &amp;c. ; while in the
          rivers and lakes are sturgeon, salmon, trout, pike,
          and perch.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi>, with the exception of a few
          Finns and Laplanders, belong (like the Danes) to the
          Scandinavian branch of the great Teutonic family,
          and speak a variety or dialect of the old Norse.
          The <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> of the state, and that to which the
          whole population, with the exception of some 7000,
          adhere, is the Lutheran, administered by 1 arch-
          bishop, 11 bishops, and over 3000 inferior clergy.
          Education in Sweden is both free and compulsory.
          In 1881, 97 per cent, of all the children between
          eight and fifteen attended school. High schools
          or gymnasia exist in all the provincial capitals ;
          and there are two universities - namely, those of
          Upsala and Lund.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Industrially</hi>, the Swedes are a busy, hardy,
          clear-headed, and progressive people. The staple
          exports are timber, bar-iron, and corn ; and the
          staple imports, textile fabrics, coal, colonial merchandise,
          and machinery. In 1880, the total value
          of all Swedish exports amounted to £12,500,000,
          and of all Swedish imports to £16,000,000, an
          increase of more than 100 per cent, in ten years.
          The manufactures are chiefly domestic, the
          peasantry supplying themselves, as winter employment,
          with nearly all the coarse woollens, linens,
          and cottons they require. There is now a considerable
          network of railways in Sweden, partly
          belonging to the state, and partly to private companies.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> is a limited monarchy, hereditary
          in the male line, and restricted to the
          Lutheran creed. The legislative power is vested
          in the king and representative Diet, consisting of
          two chambers - both elected by the people. The
          executive is managed by the king and a state council.
          Population in 1881, 4,572,000; revenue in 1882,

                <head>NORWAY.</head>
                <p>Norway occupies the western section of the
          Scandinavian peninsula ; extends from lat. 58°
          to 71° 10' north, and from long. 5° to 31° east;
          and is bounded on the west and north by the
          Northern Ocean ; east, by Russian Lapland and
          Sweden ; and south, by the Skagerrack. Its
          greatest length is upwards of 1100 miles, and
          average breadth 50; area, 120,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">general aspect</hi> of the country is bleak,
          rugged, and sterile ; the shores are rocky and
          precipitous, and, on the west, fenced by numerous
          small islands, and indented by <hi rend="italic">fiords</hi>. The interior
          consists chiefly of the mountain masses of the
          Kjölen and Dovre-fjeld, rising in the north almost
          from the water's edge, and in the south spread
          out in plateaux, or <hi rend="italic">fielle</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> fields), intersected by
          narrow valleys susceptible of a scanty culture, or
          by steep ravines, down which impetuous rivers
          cleave their way by rapids and water-falls. The
          lowest tracts, and those to which cultivation is
          chiefly limited, occur round Christiania fiord, and
          the adjoining shores of the Skagerrack, or to the
          south and east of the Bay of Trondhjem. The
          geology of the country is primary, and yields, like
          the contiguous parts of Sweden, iron, copper,
          cobalt, zinc, marble, and slate.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> is milder, but more variable than
          that of Sweden under the same parallels. The
          cause is supposed to be the warmth of the Gulf
          Stream. At Christiania, winter lasts from the
          middle of September to the middle of May, and
          summer is short and warm ; in Lapland, winter
          endures from August till May, and for many weeks
          the sun is invisible (the aurora borealis and stars
          being the only natural lights) ; while summer is
          short and fervid, the sun never sinking beneath
          the horizon.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi>, with the exception of the Laplanders,
          are members of the Teutonic race, and
          immediately descended from the old Scandinavian
          Norsemen - a dialect of whose language
          they employ. According to the census of 1865,
          the whole population, except some 5000, were
          Lutherans in <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">educational</hi> matters,
          Norway occupies a high position : elementary
          instruction is compulsory between the ages of
          seven and fourteen, and is provided for partly by
          stationary parish schools, partly, on account of
          the scattered state of the population, by ambulatory
          teachers ; and the higher departments by 13 <hi rend="italic">laerd
          skole</hi> (learned schools) in the principal towns. The
          subjects taught in these higher schools are theology,
          Latin, Greek, Norwegian, German, French,
          English, mathematics, history, and geography.
          There is a university at Christiania.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">industry</hi> of Norway is chiefly limited to
          her forests, which yield excellent timber, bark, and
          tar ; to her <hi rend="italic">fisheries</hi> of cod, lubfish, herrings, lobsters,
          salmon, anchovies, &amp;c. ; to her <hi rend="italic">mines</hi> and
          foundries of iron, copper, and cobalt ; and to
          <hi rend="italic">shipping</hi>, much of which is employed in the
          carrying-trade of other countries. <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> is
          improving ; the manufactures are almost wholly
          domestic. During the years 1877-81, the average<pb n="30"/>due (annually) of the imports into Norway was
          £8,963,000 ; and of the exports, £5,684,000.</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">government</hi>, Norway was an
          appanage of the Danish crown until 1814, when,
          by the convention of Kiel, it was placed under
          that of Sweden. It still, however, retains its own
          representative body or <hi rend="italic">Storthing</hi> (which is essentially
          democratic); and is, in reality, no more
          connected with Swedish rule than Hanover was
          formerly with Britain. The <hi rend="italic">Storthing</hi>, when
          assembled, divides itself into <hi rend="italic">two</hi> houses, the
          <hi rend="italic">Lagthing</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odelsthing</hi>. The executive is
          vested in a council of state at Christiania. Population
          in 1876, 1,806,900; public revenue (1881-82),
          £2,313,000; debt, 6 millions ; army, 40,000; navy,
          37 steamers, of which 4 were iron-clads, carrying

                <head>PRUSSIA.</head>
                <p>Prussia, the most powerful state in Germany,
          and, since the wars of 1866 and 1871, one of the
          most powerful in Europe, occupies the northern
          half of the imperial territory, from 49° 6' to 55° 35'
          N. lat. and from 6° to 22° 15' E. long. Its area
          amounts to 134,380 square miles.</p>
                <p>Its <hi rend="italic">physical aspect, geology, climate, vegetation,</hi>
          and <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> productions are identical with those
          already described under the north and west of
          Germany.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">people</hi> of Prussia belong principally to the
          great Teutonic and Slavonic families - the Germans
          forming seven-eighths of the whole. The
          <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> of the majority (five-eighths) is Protestantism
          (Lutherans and Calvinists), while rather
          less than three-eighths are Roman Catholics.
          These enjoy equal civil rights. The recently
          formed secession from the Roman Catholic Church,
          imder the title of <q>Old Catholics</q>, is now recognised
          by the state. <q>In no other country is the
          <hi rend="italic">system of education</hi> so complete ; and in none is
          the instruction of all classes so carefully provided
          for. The law imposes upon parents the strict
          obligation of sending their children to school,
          unless they can prove that they are giving them a
          proper education at home ; and care is everywhere
          taken to furnish the poor with the means of complying
          with this law, by providing their children
          with the things necessary. Every parish is bound
          to have an elementary school, and every town one
          <hi rend="italic">bürgerschule</hi> ('citizen-school') or more, according
          to the population. Above these are gymnasia,
          and in these institutions classical learning is
          pursued preparatory to admission into the universities,
          of which there are eight - in the cities of
          Berlin, Göttingen, Breslau, Halle, Bonn, Königsberg,
          Greifswalde, and Kiel.</q> Besides these, there
          are normal schools for the training of teachers,
          establishments for instruction in particular arts,
          and collections of natural history, philosophical
          apparatus, and public libraries, accessible to any
          person who chooses to avail himself of their
          assistance. The whole of this admirable system
          is upheld partly by the respective towns and
          provinces, and partly by the state, and partly also
          by fees ; the whole being under the strict and
          unremitting surveillance of government functionaries.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">national industries</hi> have been already
          mentioned under the head of Germany. Prussia
          is well provided with means of communication in
          navigable rivers and roads; and in 1882 had
          13,000 miles of railway.</p>
                <p>The government, until 1847, was an absolute
          monarchy ; since then, a modified constitutionalism
          has been introduced, though the king still
          declines to be a mere cipher, and appoints his own
          ministers, irrespective of parliamentary majorities;
          and there is therefore always the risk of a collision
          between him and his parliament. But the vigorous
          and triumphant <hi rend="italic">national</hi> policy pursued of late
          years by the monarch, under the bold and
          sagacious guidance of Prince Bismarck, has
          hitherto prevented any quarrel. Both in the
          <hi rend="italic">Herrenhaus</hi> (<q>House of Lords</q>) and the <hi rend="italic">Abgeordnetenhaus</hi>
          (<hi rend="italic">House of Deputies</hi>) the majorities
          are in sympathy with the policy of the king
          and his ministry. Population (1880), 27,279,000;
          revenue (1881), £45,500,000; debt, £103,000,000.
          The army of Prussia is the most important section
          of the army of the German Empire, and the
          imperial navy is wholly due to the initiative of
          Prussia. The Prussian troops number 350,000 in
          peace, and 900,000 in war. Capital, Berlin, with
          (1880} a population of 1,122,330.</p>

                <head>RUSSIA.</head>
                <p>Russia, the largest country in Europe, is
          bounded on the north by the Arctic Ocean ; east,
          by the Ural Mountains and the Caspian ; south,
          by the Caucasian range and the Black Sea ; and
          west, by Turkey, Austria, Prussia, and the Baltic.
          The area is estimated at 2,059,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Superficially</hi>, the territory may be regarded as
          one vast plain, with a slight elevation running
          diagonally across the interior, and forming the
          great water-shed which diverts the rivers to the
          Arctic Ocean on the one hand, and to the Caspian
          and Black Seas on the other. If we except the
          Uralian Mountains on its eastern border, and a
          hilly tract in the Crimea, there is no portion of
          the country which rises more than 1100 feet above
          the sea, and that only near Valdai in the central
          plateau. <q>The northern section, which sensibly
          declines,</q> says a native author, <q>towards the
          White and Frozen Seas, is covered with vast
          forests, abounds in marshes and lakes, and is but
          little fit for cultivation. The other, and more
          southerly portion of the plain includes the whole
          district along the Volga as far as the sandy
          steppes or deserts between the Caspian and the
          Sea of Azov, and constitutes the finest part of
          Russia ; generally, it has a fertile soil, the arable
          and pasture land preponderating over the woods
          and marshes.</q>
                </p>
                <p>The chief economic <hi rend="italic">minerals</hi> of Russia are - gold,
          platina, silver, lead, and copper from the
          Ural ; copper and tin in Finland ; iron from the
          central elevation of Valdai, &amp;c. ; coal, in Poland,
          Tula, and Ekaterinoslav, but of little importance ;
          rock-salt and brine-springs in Poland, Taurida,
          Perm, and other places ; lime, alabaster, gypsum,
          and amber.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">climate</hi> of Russia is much colder than that
          of other European countries in the same latitude ;
          and the farther we proceed eastward, the temperature
          becomes still lower, in consequence of
          the uncultivated state of the surface, distance
          from the tempering influences of the ocean, and
          the frequency of easterly and northerly winds<pb n="31"/>from the icy regions of the Arctic Ocean. In the
          northern section, the winter is severe, and lasts
          from eight to nine months ; summer, on the other
          hand, is short and hot ; and there is, generally
          speaking, neither spring nor autumn. In the
          central region, winter is also severe, but shorter;
          there is something like spring and autumn, and
          summer is still warmer. In the south, winter
          continues only for about five months ; and summer
          is often fervid and oppressive. The provinces
          bordering on the Baltic have a wet and variable
          climate, and this feature extends to the elevated
          tract which borders the upper basin of the Volga.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vegetable</hi> and <hi rend="italic">animal productions</hi> present
          less variety than might be expected from a region
          lying between the 45th and 70th parallels. The
          most remarkable feature in the former is the vast
          expanse of forest growth, covering about two-fifths
          of the entire superficies. Among the cultivated
          plants, we may notice rye all over the country ;
          barley to 67° north ; oats to 62° north ; wheat in
          the fertile tracts along the southern rivers, but
          also pretty far north ; millet along the Don ; hemp
          and flax in the west and centre ; tobacco in the
          Ukraine ; cranberries in the marshes of the north,
          fruit in the south-east ; the vine in the Crimea
          and Caucasian provinces ; and variously, potatoes,
          rape, rhubarb, poppy, &amp;c. The characteristic
          wild <hi rend="italic">animals</hi> are - the polar bear, the black and
          brown bears of the forest, the reindeer, elk, urus,
          wild-horse of the Ukraine, wolf, blue fox, lynx,
          beaver, sable, ermine, lemming, &amp;c. ; game, but
          not abundantly ; the sturgeon, salmon, trout,
          carp, pike, mackerel, and a variety of other fishes
          in the rivers ; and the bee, whose honey and
          wax form valuable products of consumption and
          export</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">population</hi> of the country, amounting in
          1881 to more than 83,000,000, is composed of a
          vast variety of races, differing in language,
          religion, manners. The chief are : the <hi rend="italic">Slavonic</hi>,
          including the Russians proper, the Poles, Bulgarians,
          and Servians ; the <hi rend="italic">Finns</hi> of Finland,
          Lapland, and Esthonia ; the <hi rend="italic">Lettish</hi> tribes of the
          Baltic provinces ; the Tatars of the Caucasus,
          Astrakhan, Kazan, the Crimea, &amp;c. ; the <hi rend="italic">Germans</hi>
          in Riga, Revel, and the Baltic provinces generally;
          the <hi rend="italic">Swedes</hi> of Finland ; and in lesser numbers,
          Jews and Greeks, with some French and English
          traders. The settled inhabitants are ranked in
          four classes - nobles, clergy (along with whom are
          classed government officials, artists and professional
          men generally), merchants, and peasants. Each
          of these classes either possesses special privileges,
          or is subject to special obligations ; on the other
          hand, each enjoys, to a certain extent, the right
          of self-administration in its own affairs. Each
          apportions its taxes, and chooses some of its own
          functionaries. In 1861, serfdom was abolished,
          and 20,000,000 peasants became freemen.</p>
                <p>All forms of <hi rend="italic">religious faith</hi> are tolerated ; but
          that of the orthodox Greek Church, which has
          54,000,000 adherents, is the established religion
          of the empire, and is professed by the Russians,
          Servians, &amp;c The Roman Catholic faith is that
          of the Poles and Lithuanians ; the Swedes, Danes,
          Finns, and most of the Germans are Lutherans ;
          Calvinism reckons but a small number of Poles
          and Germans ; Islamism is the creed of the Tatar
          tribes. In Russia there are nearly 500 cathedrals,
          and about 29,000 churches, with 70,000 parish
          clergy belonging to the established faith. Besides,
          there are about 550 convents. The emperor
          is the Head of the Church, and appoints to every
          office in it, but he does not possess the power to decide
          questions of doctrine. The ecclesiastical
          chief is the archbishop of Moscow. <hi rend="italic">Educationally</hi>,
          the country is in a very backward state.
          In 1882, 19 out of every 100 of the inhabitants
          could read and write. The number of primary
          schools was only 28,000, and the number of pupils
          1,539,975, but this is an immense advance on 1860.
          In the same year, there were 456 secondary schools
          for boys, and 384 for girls, and 8 universities.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">industrial operations</hi> of the country are
          rapidly increasing. <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> is in its first
          stage, and yet, owing to the excellency of the soil
          and comparatively small home-demand, large supplies
          are annually exported. Of late years, <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>,
          under high protective duties, have risen
          to some consideration, and the country now possesses
          a number of establishments for the preparation
          of woollen goods, silk, cotton, linen, and
          metal wares. The chief seats of these are the
          governments of Moscow, Novgorod, Vladimir,
          Saratov, Tula, and St Petersburg. The Russians
          excel in the manufacture of leather ; and from
          their advantages in respect to raw material, their
          canvas, strong linens, cordage, felt, mats, potash,
          soap, candles, caviare, and isinglass are quite
          as good as those made elsewhere. During the
          ten years from 1861 to 1871, the trade of Russia
          with foreign countries more than doubled itself;
          the imports in 1870-1880, varied from 54 to 91
          millions, the exports from 55 to 96 millions. The
          internal commerce has, of late years, been
          immensely extended by the introduction of the
          railway system; and in 1883 nearly 15,000 miles
          of railway were open for traffic; and in 1882,
          nearly 60,000 miles of telegraph.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">government</hi> is an absolute hereditary monarchy
          ; all power emanates from the czar, emperor,
          or autocrat, whose authority is without limit or
          control. He is the central point of the administration,
          the head of the church, as well as of the
          state, and to his decision, or for his sanction, all
          important measures must be submitted. His authority
          is delegated to four great boards, the
          members of which are of his own appointment
          and to these respectively are committed the ordering
          and execution of all legislative, judicial, civil,
          religious, financial, and other affairs. Population
          (1881) of Russia in Europe, 83,000,000, and
          of the empire, 98,000,000 ; revenue, £93,000,000;
          debt, £640,000,000; army, on the peace-footing,

          vessels, of which 31 are iron-clads. Capital, St

                <p>ASIA - the most extensive, the most diversified,
          and, so far as the early history of mankind
          is concerned, the most interesting of the great
          divisions of the globe - is situated between lat.
          1° 28' and 78° north, and long. 26° and 190° east. It
          thus occupies the greater portion of the Eastern
          Hemisphere, and is bounded on the north by the
          Arctic Ocean ; east, by the Pacific ; south, by the
          Indian Ocean ; and west, by Africa and Europe -
          being separated from the former by the Red Sea
          and the Isthmus of Suez ; and from the latter, by
          the Mediterranean, Black Sea, Caucasus chain,
          Caspian Sea, and the Ural Mountains. The
          region thus inclosed lies compactly together, the
          only irregularities in its bounding outline being
          that succession of peninsular projections and intervening
          gulfs which give character to its eastern
          and southern sea-board. Its greatest length, along
          the 40th parallel, is 5500 miles ; the greatest
          breadth, from Cape Romania, in the Malayan
          Peninsula, to North-east Cape, along the 104th
          meridian, 5300 miles; its area is estimated at
          upwards of 16,000,000 square miles, or above four
          times that of Europe.</p>

                <head>SUPERFICIAL FEATURES, ETC.</head>
                <p>The most striking feature in the surface of
          Asia is the great table-land of Tibet, which rises
          between India and Mongolia, like a mountain
          with a flattened top, spreading out over a
          space equal to two or three European countries,
          Tibet has an elevation of 15,000 feet - that of
          the summit of Mont Blanc - and it is the most
          extensive, and in every way the most remarkable
          of the table-lands which exist on the surface of
          the globe. On the south, its upturned edge forms
          the Himalaya Mountains, which look down upon
          the plains of India ; on the north, it terminates in
          the Kuen Lun. Beyond this chain it sinks to a
          lower table-land - that of Mongolia - which runs
          north-eastward from Western Tibet to the upper
          basin of the Amour River, at an elevation of less
          than 4000 feet. Round these two central table-lands
          of Tibet and Mongolia, the mountains and
          other highlands of Asia may be grouped. Eastward,
          the highlands of Tibet are continued by
          those of Southern China, which, furrowed and
          hollowed into great valleys by the rivers which
          traverse them, have lost the form of a plateau, and
          assumed that of a mountainous country. Between
          China and India, there projects, from Eastern
          Tibet, the highland of Indo-China, which, as it
          proceeds southwards, splits into a series of mountain
          chains, running like so many fingers from the
          back of a hand, and inclosing between them the
          valleys of Burmah, Siam, Cambodia, and Tonquin.
          Towards the north-west, the edge of the
          great Tibetan table-land is continued by the
          Pamir table-land, a lofty elevation without abrupt
          descent on either side, described by the people
          of Central Asia as <q>the roof of the world.</q> It is<pb n="33"/>connected on the south-west by the Hindu Kush
          with another table-land, that of Iran, which extends
          from the Indus to the Greek Archipelago,
          with an elevation of 6000 feet in Afghanistan,
          4000 in Persia, 5000 in Armenia, and from 2000
          to 4000 in Asia Minor. Two detached table-lands,
          above the elevation of 1000 feet, fill the
          interior of Arabia and Southern India. The mountain-
          chains of Asia generally run along the edges
          of the plateaus. The Himalaya include the loftiest
          mountains of the globe - Mount Everest, 29,000
          feet; Kunchinginga, 28,156 feet ; and Dhawaligiri,
          26,680.</p>
                <p>The plains of Asia - by which we mean that
          part of the surface of the continent lying at an
          elevation of less than 500 feet above the sea - form
          a vast expanse in North-western Asia, stretching
          from the edge of the Iranian table-land, through
          Northern Siberia, to the Arctic Ocean and Behring
          Strait. This great plain sinks on the shores of
          the Caspian to a level below that of the ocean.
          The other plains of Asia, which lie south and east
          of the table-lands, are much less extensive, but,
          lying under a warmer climate, they are of infinitely
          greater importance. The great plain of China
          includes the deltas of Yang-tze-kiang, the Hoang-ho,
          and the Pei-ho ; the Indo-Gangetic plain,
          those of the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra ; the
          Assyrian or Babylonian plain, that of the Tigris
          and Euphrates.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">seas, bays,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gulfs</hi> which indent and
          intersect the surface of Asia are in noway so
          remarkable as those which give character to
          Europe.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">islands</hi> more immediately connected with
          Asia are the Liakhov group, in the Arctic Ocean;
          the Aleutians, in the Sea of Kamtchatka ; the
          islands of Japan ; Saghalien, Formosa, Hainan,
          and Chusan, off the coast of China ; Ceylon, the
          Andaman and Nicobar Isles, in the Indian
          Ocean ; and Cyprus, in the Levant. (The large
          islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, &amp;c.
          generally known as the East India Islands, are
          treated in the following number.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lakes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inland seas</hi> of Asia constitute one
          of its peculiar features, most of these being salt or
          brackish, having no visible outlet, and being in
          some instances considerably beneath the general
          level of the ocean. The largest of these is the
          Caspian, having a length of 760 miles, with an
          average breadth of 200, receiving the rivers Volga
          and Ural, but with no outlet ; its waters brackish,
          and of unknown depth, and its surface-level 84
          feet beneath that of the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">rivers</hi> which water the continent, a large
          number are of the first-class. In Eastern Asia,
          we find the Amour, Hoang-ho, Yang-tze-kiang,
          and Hong-kiang, all of which are slow-flowing
          rivers, and navigable for a long way into the
          interior. India without the Ganges is watered
          by the Camboja, Meinam, and Irrawadi; and
          Hindustan by the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and
          Indus. The Ganges, though subject to annual
          inundations, and to a very rapid and dangerous
          tidal bore, is one of the most valuable rivers in
          the world, being, with most of its tributaries,
          navigable to the very basis of the mountains.
          The same, however, cannot be said of the Indus,
          which, though of ample volume, has an obstructive
          and shifting delta, which renders it of little
          avail, unless to small steamers. In Western
          Asia are the Tigris and Euphrates - the latter,
          navigable for flat-bottomed steamers so high as
          Bir.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>CLIMATE, ETC.</head>
                <p>In Northern Asia, no mountain chain prevents
          the entrance of the polar winds, and, in consequence,
          they sweep southwards over the plains
          of Siberia and Turkestan. In Southern and
          South-eastern Asia, the monsoons (see METEOROLOGY)
          explain the cause and course of the
          winds. They enable us also to explain the distribution
          of rain in Asia. The great mountains
          which fringe the table-land condense the vapours
          brought from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and
          thus China, Indo-China, Eastern India, the
          coasts of the Indian peninsula, and the southern
          sea-board of Arabia, are well watered by periodical
          rains. North of the table-land and its fringe of
          mountains there is a fall of periodical rains, which,
          although scanty, redeems from sterility the countries
          on which it falls. In the interior of the continent
          and within the plateaux, on the other hand,
          rain is scarcely known. Thus, the Altai, the Himalaya,
          and the Chinese highlands make Tibet and
          Mongolia the most arid countries of the globe.
          The great Desert of Gobi, the deserts of Persia,
          of Syria, Arabia, and Western India, may all be
          explained by the fact, that the winds which come
          to them from the ocean have been robbed of their
          vapour by the mountain ranges. In Southern
          India, the Western Ghauts receive the vapours
          of the south-west monsoon ; the Eastern Ghauts,
          those of the north-east monsoon, and both are
          well watered. But the winds which pass into the
          interior have become dry, and hence the aridity of
          the table-land of the Deccan, and the necessity of
          irrigation to make it fertile. The fact is, that
          aridity is the chief feature of all the countries lying
          between the Red Sea and Northern China.
          They can be rendered fertile when cultivated by a
          peaceful and industrious population, intelligent
          enough to construct and keep in repair reservoirs
          and irrigation canals; but they become utterly
          desert when war or bad government interferes
          with the combinations and arrangements necessary
          for this purpose. Hence, there are no countries
          the prosperity of which is so completely dependent,
          as those of Western and Central Asia, on
          peace and good government.</p>
                <p>Asia is traversed by all the zones of climate into
          which the surface of the globe has been divided by
          meteorologists and botanists. Northern Siberia,
          to a line just south of the Arctic circle, has a temperature
          of from 5° on the north to 30° Fahr. on
          the south. It is the country of the Tundras -
          frozen marshes which fill the lower basins of the
          Siberian streams. The cold temperate zone succeeds -
          stretching from the last area to a line running
          from the Gulf of Finland to the northern
          shore of the Sea of Okhotsk. It has a temperature
          of from 30° to 40° Fahr. and is the zone to
          which Norway and Finland belong. There occur
          within it tracts of arable soil, in which the hardier
          grains, oats, barley, and rye, potatoes and turnips,
          can be cultivated in sheltered situations. The
          next, the temperate zone, from 40° to 60° Fahr.
          extends southwards to a line which runs from the
          Black Sea to the north of Corea, and the Strait of
          Sangar, which separates the southern from the
          northern islands of Japan. It has the climate of<pb n="34"/>
          England ; and in it deciduous trees, meadowgrasses,
          and the European cereals are cultivated
          with success. It includes on the east the Desert
          of Gobi, and on the west the parched steppes of
          Northern Turkestan. The warm temperate zone
          from 60° to 70° Fahr. lies south of the Caucasus
          and the Desert of Gobi. It includes Northern
          Arabia, the south of Persia, and the Punjab
          and Northern China. It is the climate of Spain
          and Italy, of the orange and fig, the vine and
          the tea-plant. In it the grains usually cultivated
          are rice and millet. It occupies on the west
          the arid region of Asia, including the Syrian,
          Persian, and Bactrian and Indian deserts ; but on
          the east, it receives copious showers. Its driest
          districts are traversed by great rivers. Tibet,
          which is in the latitude of Cairo, is thrown by
          its high elevation into the colder zones. The
          tropical belt - temperature from 72° to 82° - in
          Asia occupies a comparatively limited space. It
          includes the Arabian sea-board, the greater part of
          India, the Indo-Chinese peninsula, and that part
          of China which lies south of the Nan-ling chain.
          It is the zone of the palm, the banana, and the
          sugar-cane. Within this belt, forests of flowering
          trees, infinite in their variety, and interlaced with
          lianas and parasitic plants in all places where
          the atmosphere is moist, overshadow the soil with
          an almost impenetrable covering of vegetation.
          Central, Northern, and Western Asia are, in short,
          characterised by deserts and scanty meadows,
          the forests being confined to Southern Siberia, and
          the mountain-ranges exposed to the southern
          winds. In the promontories of South-eastern Asia,
          on the other hand, is displayed all the tropical
          luxuriance of vegetation which characterises Central
          America.</p>
                <p>With this distribution of the zones of climate
          and of vegetation is connected that of animal
          life. In Northern Siberia, where there is almost
          perpetual ice and snow, and little more than a
          scanty vegetation of lichens and mosses, the reindeer
          finds its proper food, and supports whole
          tribes of men. In Central Asia, the horse and
          the ox are the chief domestic animals of the Tatar
          population. The Bactrian camel enables them
          to cross the inhospitable deserts of Mongolia and
          Turkestan. Farther to the south, it is replaced by
          the Arabian camel, in the Persian and Syrian
          deserts. In India, the buffalo and the elephant
          are the characteristic beasts of burden. In the
          tropical woods of South-eastern Asia, reptiles and
          beasts of prey become dangerous enemies to man.
          The reports given of the destruction of human life
          by snake-bites and tigers in Indo-China, have
          been pronounced exaggerated ; but the statistics
          annually collected in India confirm the most
          startling of them. An official notice gives the
          number of persons killed in British India in 1881
          at the frightful total of 18,670; while 2757 were
          slain by wild animals. In the same year, 43,609
          head of cattle were reported killed by snakes and
          wild animals; while 254,968 snakes and 15,274
          wild animals were destroyed, 103,000 rupees being
          paid by government for their destruction. In
          Madras province, 1195 were killed by snakes and
          wild animals in 1882 - 920 by snakes, 206 by tigers,
          28 by panthers and leopards. In 1873, a single
          tigress caused the destruction of thirteen villages,
          and threw 256 square miles of country out of cultivation.
          In the Central Provinces, in three years
          the deaths of 946 persons had been ascertained
          to have been caused by tigers. It is scarcely
          possible to believe that Mr Markham is not
          talking ironically when he enumerates among
          the difficulties in the way of getting rid of these
          <q>gigantic cats,</q> that their wholesale destruction
          is objected to by Englishmen in India, as
          that of a kind of game which affords excellent
          sport when shot with the rifle ; and by the native
          population, on the ground, that the <q>man-eating
          tiger</q> is a kind of incarnate divinity, and that it
          would be dangerous to offend it!</p>
                <p>In the number devoted to ANTHROPOLOGY,
          enough has been said of the distribution of man
          in Asia ; while the rise and course of the chief
          streams of civilisation have been traced in the
          HISTORY OF ANCIENT NATIONA. It may be
          well, however, to remind the reader of the events
          occurring in the twelfth century which were
          destined to influence the whole continent. The
          Mongols who dwelt on the border of the Great
          Eastern Desert, under the lead of Genghis Khan,
          then penetrated into Siberia, attacked and took
          possession of China on the east, and Turkestan
          and Persia on the west. The sons of Genghis
          continued his conquests, destroying the califate
          of Bagdad, and advancing into India. His grandson,
          Kublai Khan, ruled over the greatest empire
          that ever existed, extending as it did from the
          Baltic to the Pacific, and from the Arctic zone
          to the Indian Ocean. It was in the reign of the
          Great Khan that Marco Polo, the Venetian, travelled
          through Asia, and recorded his observation
          in a wonderful narrative, which has been of inestimable
          value in guiding and stimulating geographical
          research, and which, as recently done into
          English by Colonel Yule, is one of the most readable
          and fascinating of books. Towards the
          end of the 14th century little remained of the
          empire of the Great Khan. A new conqueror
          then made his appearance - Timur the Tatar,
          or Tamerlane, who, after invading Persia, Egypt,
          and India, made Samarcand the seat of his
          empire, and a chief centre of Mohammedan
          piety or learning, the position it has ever since
          retained in the Mohammedan East, a fact which
          it is important to remember in connection with
          the recent conquests of Russia. The empire of
          Timur was soon broken up ; but his descendant,
          Baber, in the early part of the i6th century, still
          ruled at Samarcand over countries extending
          south and westward to the Indus. Baber invaded
          India in 1525, and taking Delhi and Agra, founded
          the empire of the Great Moguls. The modern
          history of the continent is that of the English conquest
          of India, the Russian conquest of Siberia
          and Turkestan, and the growth of English commerce
          in China and Japan. Before we refer to
          these subjects, it is desirable to describe separately
          the different countries into which Asia is
          divided.</p>

                <head>GREAT DIVISIONS OPF ASIA.</head>
                <p>A line running through the steppes north of the
          Caspian and Aral Seas, and along the northern
          edge of the Desert of Gobi and Shamo to the
          north of Corea and the Japanese islands, divides
          Asia into northern and southern parts. Southern
          Asia is, in turn, divided into a western and
          eastern section by the mountains of Eastern<pb n="35"/>Afghanistan, and the western Desert of Gobi ; and
          the eastern section is again subdivided, in a more
          conventional manner, by the chain of the Himalaya,
          into the Chinese and the Indian countries.
          The great divisions of Asia, with an estimate of
          their populations, are as follows : 1. Northern Asia,
          8 millions ; 2. Chinese region, 375 millions ; 3.
          Indian region, 260 millions ; 4. Western Asia, 47
          millions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>NORTHERN ASIA.</head>
                <p>The Siberian countries, as has already been
          seen, are traversed by a mountainous tract, which
          bounds the great Mongol desert on the north.
          It includes the Altai and the Yablonoi Mountains.
          These sink on the north to the great plain which
          is drained by the rivers Obi, Yenisei, Lena, and
          Kolima, descending to the frozen plains of the
          Arctic Sea. Siberia is not an unproductive
          country ; it abounds in mineral wealth, the
          great mining districts being those of Barnaul,
          in the Altai, and Nerchinsk, in the Yablonoi
          Mountains. The middle valley of the Yenisei
          is the most favoured agricultural district ; and
          there, rye, oats, and wheat are successfully cultivated.
          The countries recently annexed in Manchuria,
          on the banks of the Amour, have a warmer
          climate, and when colonised, will probably become
          the most productive of the Russian settlements
          in Northern Asia. The Siberian rivers are admirably
          suited to inland navigation, and have been
          connected along their upper courses by canals, so
          that it is possible to convey the products of the
          middle Yenisei to the confines of European
          Russia and the peninsula beyond the Lena. A
          great highway also traverses Siberia, along which
          Chinese products are brought from Katchta, 150
          miles south of Lake Baikal, to Moscow. The
          length of the road between these places is 4452
          miles. Politically, Siberia forms a province of
          the Russian empire. Its towns are unimportant.
          The largest is Irkutsk (pop. 28,000), on the Angara,
          north-west of Lake Baikal. Tomsk (pop. 21,000)
          depends on the mines. Although Siberia formed
          part of the empire of Genghis Khan, Europeans
          were ignorant of its existence as late as the end
          of the 16th century. In the year 1580, a Cossack,
          an absconded criminal, named Yermak, at the
          head of a crowd of wild adventurers, crossed the
          Ural, and conquered Western Siberia. In 1584,
          he was drowned in the Irtish ; but the Russians
          continued their conquests. They founded Tomsk
          in 1604, and Irkutsk in 1661. To their conquests
          in Turkestan, we shall refer below.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>WESTERN ASIA.</head>
                <p>This region lies west of the Indus and the
          Desert of Gobi, and south of the Siberian steppes.
          It is Asia Proper, the Asia of history, and the
          ancient abode of the Arabian and Persian races.
          We have seen that it is covered from east to west
          by the lofty table-land of Iran ; bounded on the
          north by the plains of Turkestan ; on the south, by
          those of the Tigris and Euphrates. Arabia, south
          of the latter, forms an independent table-land. The
          whole region is characterised by its arid climate,
          the hills by which it is traversed shutting out
          all the winds which might bring rains to the
          parched soil. Its lofty summits, however, are
          reached by vapour-laden clouds; and two river-systems, that of the Oxus and Jaxartes, on the
          north, and the Tigris and Euphrates, on the south,
          of the Iranian table-land, were made the means,
          in ancient times, of irrigating countries which
          supported a vast population.</p>
                <p>Three races inhabit Western Asia - the Aryans,
          chiefly Persians, the central table-land ; the
          Semites, chiefly Arabs, Arabia, and the southern
          plain ; and the Mongol Turks, the plain of Turkestan.
          The contest between these three races has
          lasted since history began. The most powerful
          governments of Western Asia are now those of
          Turkey and Persia, representing rival Mohammedan
          sects, the Sunnites and Shiites, who are
          bitterly hostile to each other ; and they, like all
          eastern states, are constantly weakened by the
          interminable strife and feuds which, on the death
          of a monarch, are sure to break out among the
          members of his family, owing to varied and illunderstood
          rules of succession.</p>
                <p>Western Asia lies between the two most populous
          regions of the globe, Europe and Southeastern
          Asia. In all ages, great commercial
          routes have existed between them. One passed
          from the Black Sea across Northern Persia into
          India. The traffic on this line has been interfered
          with by Turkish banditti in Northern Persia,
          and by Afghan civil wars farther east. It has
          been also, and more seriously, interfered with by
          steam-navigation in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.
          There is still, however, a great necessity for a direct
          route overland from Europe to India. A network
          of railways connects all parts of Europe, and a
          similar system has just been completed for India.
          The importance of connecting the two is evident.
          Various schemes are suggested. One is to connect
          the Mediterranean with the Upper Euphrates, and
          to make that river and the Persian Gulf the line
          of a railway to India. Another is to connect Constantinople
          with Angora, Sivas, Diarbekir, Mosul,
          and Kermanshah ; and to cross Persia by Ispahan
          and Kerman to Bender-Abbas, thence proceeding
          along the coast to Kurrachee. One reason for
          promoting this scheme is, that it would continue
          Turkish lines already in process of construction.
          A third scheme is proposed by M. de Lesseps.
          It would connect Orenburg with Samarcand,
          Balkh, Cabul, and Peshawur, on the Indian
          frontier. The proposal seems wild, but not more
          so than American undertakings recently completed.
          That any of these lines would confer incalculable
          benefits on the countries through which
          they pass, it is impossible to doubt Western
          Asia may be divided as follows :</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Turkestan</hi> was said, till recently, to be bounded
          on the east by the Bolor Mountains ; but a better
          knowledge of the geography of these countries
          has shewn that no such chain exists. In Europe,
          mountains and uplands form the boundaries
          between states ; but it is different in Central
          Asia, where the best cultivated tracts often lie
          along the mountain-ridges, and wastes surround<pb n="36"/>the hollows they inclose. Turkestan is, for this
          reason, bounded rather by the Gobi Desert, than
          the <q>roof of the world,</q> or Pamir steppe, which,
          in recent maps, takes the place of the Bolor chain.
          The country consists of the mountain-system
          which ramifies north-east and west from the
          Pamir table-land, and the low plains to which
          these highlands sink on all sides. Two races
          occupy Turkestan - the Tajiks, or Aryan and Persian
          speaking native population, who are agriculturists
          and inhabitants of towns ; and the Turks,
          chiefly nomads, but to whom the ruling caste
          belongs. They are Mongol in race and language,
          and under their nile the independent states or
          khanates into which the country has been divided,
          have been the scene of perpetual strife and anarchy.
          The Russians, in those parts of Turkestan which
          they have annexed, have found the subject population,
          the Tajiks, industrious and frugal, remarkably
          intelligent, and, like the Japanese, anxious to adopt
          European habits, and to become acquainted with
          the arts and sciences of Europe.</p>
                <p>The advance of the Russians in Northern Turkestan
          promises to confer inestimable benefits on
          the country. In 1864 they took possession of
          Tashkand, forming part of Fergana, long famous
          for its beauty and fertility. A religious war
          against the Russians followed the conquest, and
          they added to their territory in 1868 Samarcand,
          the old capital of Tamerlane and Baber - venerated
          all over the East, and especially in India,
          as a holy city, only second to Mecca. The possession
          of Tashkand and Samarcand enabled
          Russia to control two of the chief Turkish khanates.
          One remained, that of Khiva, at the mouth
          of the Oxus, surrounded by deserts, and, in consequence,
          deemed inaccessible. But in 1873 it too
          was conquered, and a treaty was concluded with
          the khan. The Russians have more recently subjected
          Merv and other districts belonging to the
          most savage people of the East - the Turkomans,
          who inhabit the northern frontier of Persia, and
          who have converted the once beautiful Khorassan
          into a desert, and destroyed all security for life
          and property in Northern Persia.</p>
                <p>The chief cities of Turkestan are Tashkand
          (pop. 90,000), and Samarcand (pop. 20,000), both
          Russian. The other towns are small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Eastern Turkestan, or Kashgaria</hi>, which lies
          east of the Pamir table-land, has only recently
          become known to us from the works of Mr Shaw
          and Dr G. Henderson. Shut up between the
          Thian Shan and Kuen Lun Mountains and the
          Desert of Gobi, geographers did not suspect that
          in this part of Asia there existed a well-cultivated,
          well-governed country, with three millions of
          inhabitants. Although the inhabitants now
          speak Turkish, they are said to shew many
          Aryan characteristics ; and in the upper valley
          of the Pamir table-land, recent travellers have
          discovered what they believe to be pure Aryan
          tribes. East Turkestan contains cities of 100,000
          inhabitants, the chief of which are Kashgar
          and Yarkand. In 1853 a rebellion broke out
          in Kashgar, which ended in throwing off the
          Chinese yoke ; and Kashgaria was an independent
          Mohammedan state till the death in 1877 of
          Yakoob Beg, its first native prince. On the
          accession of his son, the Chinese authorities
          reasserted themselves ; and in 1879 the little
          state was again a Chinese province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Afghanistan</hi> forms the north-eastern part of the
          table-land of Iran already described. Its chief
          slope lies towards the Persian desert, and it is
          drained by the river Helmund, which falls into
          the Lake of Seistan. In the north, the country is
          traversed by ridges of hills, but to the south-east
          it is more level. Everywhere the soil is arid ; but
          the tracts lying along the streams are cultivated,
          and considerable crops of rice, maize, sugar, cotton,
          and tobacco are produced. The Tajiks, who
          form about one-third of the population, are agricultural
          labourers in a state of serfdom. The
          Afghans, who form nearly another third, are the
          ruling race. They are a tall, vigorous, and handsome
          people. The remaining third of the population
          is chiefly composed of Mongols, including the
          Hazareh and Eimak - Mongols proper, and the
          Turkoman tribe of Kuzzilbashes, who act as
          domestic servants and soldiers. The Tajiks speak
          Persian, the Afghans Pushtu, which, although an
          Aryan language, is more akin to the languages of
          India than of Iran. The chief towns of Afghanistan
          owe their importance to their military position.
          They are Candahar (pop. 50,000), Cabul (50,000),
          and Herat (100,000). The city last named, and the
          country surrounding it, are inhabited by a Persian
          population, who differ, however, from the Persians
          of Western Iran in professing the Sunnee rather
          than the Shiite Mohammedanism. The Afghans
          made their first prominent appearance in the
          history of the East, on the death of Nadir Shah,
          when Persia became finally dismembered. It
          was then that Ahmed Khan Duranee seized
          Candahar, and founded the dynasty, the Duranees,
          who have since retained the throne. The
          law of succession in Afghanistan is, that the
          Ameer shall select his successor from his generally
          numerous family ; and the consequence has
          been an interminable strife on the death
          of every monarch, and such a record of fratricidal
          crime and warfare as no other chapter
          of history presents. The war with Britain in
          1879-80 could hardly be expected to improve the
          state of affairs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Beloochistan</hi>, south of Afghanistan, and east of
          Persia, sinks to the low tracts adjoining the Indus
          and the Indian Ocean. The climate of the highlands
          is cold for the latitude ; that of the plains,
          tropical and arid. The inhabitants are chiefly
          pastoral, and there are no important towns. Two races
          occupy the country - the Belooches, who speak
          a Persian dialect, in the west ; and the
          Brahoes, who speak an Indian tongue, on the
          east. The former are a powerful, bold, military
          race, living in tents, and chiefly pastoral. The latter
          are a people of smaller stature, but patient
          and laborious. They are agriculturists and
          mechanics. The chief town is Kelat (pop.
          12,000). The history of Beloochistan as an independent
          state is quite modern, and the country
          has been alternately considered as forming part
          of India and of Persia. England has endeavoured,
          by granting a subsidy to the Khan of
          Kelat, to enable him to establish a powerful
          government in Beloochistan, which may be made
          responsible for the conduct of the petty chiefs along
          our frontier.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Persia</hi> forms the middle part of the Iranian
          table-land. It has an elevation of from 2000 to
          3000 feet above the sea-level. On the north it is
          bounded by the Elburz chain, continued eastward<pb n="37"/>at a lower elevation by the hills of Khorassan.
          The western part of the country is traversed by a
          series of mountains, running north-west and south-east,
          and inclosing numerous valleys which can
          be rendered exceedingly fertile by cultivation. In
          these districts, the grams and fruits of Southern
          Europe are cultivated. The central region of
          Persia forms a depression with a desert surface
          in which the streams from the surrounding hillcountries
          disappear. It contains, however, a few
          depressions which form fertile oases. The northern
          slope of the Elburz Mountains sloping to the Caspian,
          forms on the margin of that sea a country
          of wonderful fertility. The forests of Central
          America are not more luxuriant than Mazanderan
          and Ghilan, the two Caspian provinces of Persia.
          They produce rice, sugar, and all the products of
          the tropics, and more especially silk, which forms
          one of the chief exports of Persia. Persia has an
          importance in history much out of proportion with
          its present population. There is no doubt that
          in antiquity, and during the middle ages, while
          irrigation-works still fertilised great tracts of
          country, Persia supported a great population. A
          native estimate fixed the population at 200,000,000;
          and the French traveller, Chardin, in the 17th
          century, thought 40,000,000 not too high a figure.
          It is only within a few years that careful estimates
          made on the spot have reduced the current
          estimate to 7,653,600, 1,900,000 nomads, 1,900,000
          peasants, and the rest townspeople. The same
          estimate states the population of the chief cities
          to be as follows : Tabriz, the commercial capital,
          120,000; Teheran, 100,000; Meshed, 60,000;
          and Ispahan, 60,000. The population of Persia
          has been long diminishing, a fact no doubt
          chiefly due to the invasion of the Turkish races,
          and long continuance of misrule and extortion
          by the provincial governors, the neglect of
          irrigation works, and the consequent recurrence
          of famines, in a dry country where successful
          cultivation depends on an artificial supply of
          water.</p>
                <p>The history of Persia in modem times is chiefly
          that of the struggle between the native and the
          invading races, the periods of prosperity generally
          coinciding with the success of the former.
          Thus the country flourished under the Sassanian
          kings from the 3d to the 7th century. The Arab,
          Mongol, and Turkish invasions followed. Early in
          the 16th century, the Sofi dynasty restored the
          prosperity of Persia. Shah Abbas the Great,
          who drove the Turks out of Khorassan, extended
          toleration to the Armenian Christians, whom he
          induced to settle in the country ; constructed
          important public works, irrigation canals, and
          roads, and did all he could to encourage agriculture
          and trade. He established a splendid capital
          at Ispahan. Nadir Shah (1736-1747), a Turkish
          adventurer, put an end to the Sofi dynasty.
          After his death, Persia became really split into
          a number of independent states until 1795, when
          another adventurer, a Turkoman of the Kajar
          race, founded the present dynasty. During this
          century, Persia has been weakened by wars with
          Russia. In October 1856, the Persians took
          possession of Herat, which they were compelled
          to restore, after a war with England. They have
          since been engaged in disputes with the Afghans
          and Belooches, settled by English arbitration, and
          in the old struggle with the Turkomans, which the
          advance of the Russians now bids fair to terminate - if it be decided that the exigences of European
          policy do not absolutely require that there should
          be an artificial desert bet^veen the English and
          Russian possessions in the East.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Armenia and the Caucasian countries</hi> lie between
          Persia and Asia Minor, bounded on the
          north by the Caucasus, or rather by the steppe
          beyond, and on the south by the plains of the
          Euphrates. Armenia Proper forms part of the
          great Iranian plateau. It has an elevation of
          from 5000 to 6000 feet, and is a bare, treeless
          country, with a cold climate. Georgia is warmer,
          and the soil is in many places very fertile.
          Under Russian protection, German colonists have
          founded settlements in various parts of the
          country, and good roads have been formed. A
          railway is now being constructed which will
          connect the Black Sea and the Caspian. The
          Armenians are Christians of the Armenian
          Church ; the Georgians belong to the Greek
          Church. Mohammedanism prevails in the Caucasus.
          The chief town in Armenia is Erzeroum
          (pop. 40,000) ; and in Georgia, Tiflis (pop. 60,000).
          Since the beginning of this century, the Caucasus,
          Georgia, and part of Armenia have been annexed
          to Russia, with great advantage to the native
          populations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Asia Minor</hi> forms the western extremity of the
          table-land of Iran. It sinks, as it proceeds westward,
          from an elevation of 4000 to 1000 feet above
          the level of the sea, and finally subsides into low
          and fertile valleys drained by the rivers falling into
          the AEgean Sea. In the interior of the peninsula,
          there are desolate plains and wastes, which never
          can be cultivated ; but there are also vast tracts of
          fine agricultural soil, covered with the remains of
          old and splendid cities, shewing that the country
          was at one period the abode of a numerous, a
          prosperous, and highly civilised people. The
          chief inhabitants of the interior of the table-land
          are now wandering Turks and Kurds. The Greek
          population is chiefly confined to the sea-coast.
          We know little of the peoples inhabiting Asia
          Minor before the Greeks, but it seems probable
          that the discoveries made in the plain of Troy
          by Dr Schliemann will establish the fact, that it
          has been occupied in succession by races which
          had made considerable progress in civilisation,
          long before its colonisation by the Greeks. It
          was during the Roman epoch that Asia Minor
          seems to have reached its highest prosperity.
          It was then that great roads were constructed
          throughout the country, that agriculture and trade
          flourished, and that the great and beautiful cities,
          to the ruins of which we have just referred, sprang
          up over the whole country. The religious controversies
          which broke out in the 5th century, and
          which led to so much strife in the Eastern empire,
          were the chief cause of the weakness which opened
          the way for Turkish invasion. After the Crimean
          war, when the Turks were less carefully watched
          than they had been by Russia and the other
          European powers, the last relic of the independent
          Christian communities in Asia Minor, Zeitun,
          was destroyed - the inhabitants being massacred
          in a manner which recalls the worst atrocities of
          Cawnpore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Syria and Mesopotamia</hi> may be held to include
          all the countries lying between Armenia and
          Arabia, Persia and the Mediterranean Sea. Syria<pb n="38"/>is traversed from north to south by two mountain-chains, inclosing a valley, which, in the south,
          where it is occupied by the Dead Sea, sinks
          below the level of the Mediterranean. Like the
          rest of Western Asia, it suffers from aridity. In
          some places, however, where the streams have
          been employed for irrigation, as in the country
          round Damascus, it becomes amazingly fertile.
          The inhabitants of Syria speak Arabic, but are
          not Arabs ; they resemble more the inhabitants
          of South-eastern Europe. Neither are they all
          Mohammedans. They are hopelessly divided by
          their religious creeds. The Druses of the Lebanon
          have a religion of their own. In 1860 their sanguinary
          conflicts with the Maronites, Christians
          who now acknowledge the supremacy of the pope,
          were put an end to by a French expedition.
          The Mohammedan population is partly Shiite,
          and partly Sunnite, and is split by minor distinctions,
          which also appear to be causes of strife.
          At Aleppo (pop. 70,000) there are large manufactories
          of silk and cotton. The city has been
          for a time falling off in population, due to an
          earthquake in 1822, and more recently to the
          growing competition of the West in the markets
          of Asia. Damascus (pop. 150,000), the capital
          of Syria, is less prosperous than it was, it never
          having recovered from the injury done to its
          trade in 1860, when the fanatical Mohammedan
          mob rose and massacred the Christian population.
          Beyrout (pop. 60,000) is the seaport of
          Damascus, and the chief seat of European commerce
          with Syria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Palestine</hi>, although forming only a small, and
          one of the least fertile provinces of Syria, claims
          special notice as the scene of events which have
          influenced the whole course of human history. It
          consists of (1) The deep valley of the Jordan, in
          which lie the Sea of Galilee, 120 feet above, and
          the Dead Sea, 653 feet below, the Mediterranean ;
          (2) The hills and table-lands of Gilead and Moab,
          which bound this vaUey on the east ; (3) The
          table-land of Judaea, Samaria, and Galilee, with a
          mean elevation of 1000 feet, bounding the valley
          of the Jordan on the west ; and (4) The plain
          of Sharon, which lies between the last-mentioned
          table-land and the sea. The geography and history
          of Palestine are probably better known to
          most Englishmen than those of any country except
          their own ; however, the pleasure-excursions
          which the enterprising Mr Thomas Cook now
          conducts through the chief scenes of sacred history,
          give his pilgrims a very different impression
          of the Syrian landscape from that obtained
          from the works of the old Italian painters, and
          the engravings from them, which still find a place
          in our illustrated Bibles. The tourists return probably
          better pleased than when they went with
          the fogs and leaden skies of England, and above
          all, impressed with that want of water everywhere
          which now characterises the Promised Land. Yet
          they see traces of ancient cultivation. They see that
          the country must at one time have been highly productive,
          and supported a teeming population, for
          even in those places where it is now most desolate,
          are the vast remains of terraces, constructed to
          collect the rains and fertilise the soil, and of cities,
          which seem to have crowned every eminence.
          Jerusalem (population probably 20,000) stands on
          the highland of Judaea, in a rocky country, at an
          elevation of 2660 feet above the sea. One-half of
          the population is Mohammedan ; one-third, Christian
          ; and what remains, Jewish. Its only industry
          is the manufacture of beads and crucifixes and
          other objects, sold to pilgrims, of whom more than
          10,000 annually visit the holy places in and
          around the city.</p>
                <p>Assyria was the name once given to the country
          lying west of the Zagros Mountains, and drained
          by the Upper Tigris and its eastern tributaries.
          It corresponds pretty nearly with the modern
          Kurdistan. In the east, the mountainous districts
          are well watered and productive; but westward,
          the plains are alternately a garden and a wilderness,
          the heat of summer completely drying up
          the vegetation. The Kurds are a rude people,
          speaking an Indo-Germanic language, but indulging
          to a great extent in the predatory habits
          of the Turks and Arabs. Mossul (pop. 30,000) is
          the seat of a Syrian Christian patriarch, and was
          anciently the metropolis of the Mesopotamian
          Christians, of whom there are still said to be
          10,000 in the city. It is needless to say that the
          ancient prosperity of Assyria is attested by wonderful
          ruins of reservoirs and canals for irrigation,
          and of splendid and populous cities, of which
          Nineveh was the chief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Babylonia</hi> is the name given to that part of the
          plain of the Tigris and Euphrates south of the
          point where the rivers first approach each other.
          It is a low alluvial plain, and forms for the most
          part an unproductive and unhealthy wilderness;
          but in early times it had, under a skilful system
          of irrigation, the very highest fertility. In antiquity,
          the country was, in fact, traversed in all
          directions by great canals, which have been described
          by the Greek historians. The soil is now
          only cultivated near the villages, but where it is
          irrigated, its fertility is unbounded. The depredation
          of wandering Kurds and Arabs, and Turkish
          misgovernment, give no hope of any improvement
          in its cultivation. The capital is Bagdad (pop.
          65,000). It has manufactures of silk, cotton, and
          leather. Bassorah (pop. 60,000), on the Shat-el-
          Arab, the name given to the Tigris and Euphrates
          after their union, is the port for Indian
          commerce. According to Sir Henry Rawlinson,
          recent researches carry back the historical
          period of Babylon to about 5000 years B.C. (see
          HISTORY OF ANCIENT NATIONS). Now that
          the extension of the cultivated surface of the
          globe has become the chief necessity of the
          rapidly increasing population of Europe and
          India, it is not impossible that modern statesmen
          and capitalists may consider if it would not be
          possible to recultivate an area which could supply
          with food and clothing the inhabitants of a whole
          series of cities which, in ancient Babylonia, seem
          to have rivalled the capital in size and splendour.
          Asia Minor, Syria, and Mesopotamia form part
          of the Turkish empire, as immediate possessions
          of the sultan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Arabia</hi> lies south of the Syrian countries. It
          forms, as has been already stated, a lofty table-land,
          nowhere sinking to less than 1000 feet, and
          surrounded on the west and south by lofty
          mountain-chains and terraces. The southern
          slopes are, at certain seasons, well watered, especially
          in parts of Yemen on the west, and Oman
          on the east. Between these countries lies Dahma,
          or the great sandy desert which spreads over one-third
          of the table-land. Farther north is the<pb n="39"/>highland of Nedjed, in which rain falls at certain
          seasons and fertilises the soil. This district is
          bounded on the north by the Syrian Desert. The
          Nedjed was, until recently, when it was visited by
          Mr Palgrave, supposed to be as sterile as the
          coasts of the Red Sea. This has been found to
          be a mistake. It is a fertile and well-cultivated
          country, inhabited by a numerous population of
          settled inhabitants. It is the seat of the empire
          of the Wahabis, described as a sect of warlike
          Mohammedan Quakers, who do not recognise
          the claims of the Turks to any suzerainty over
          Arabia. Their chief city is Riad (pop. 40,000),
          and their territory includes a large number of
          towns with populations of from 10,000 to 30,000
          inhabitants. The Turks exercise a nominal sovereignty
          over Yemen and the Hedjaz. The former
          is a fertile country, which seems at a remote
          period to have been better cultivated than now,
          by means of reservoirs and irrigation canals.
          It produces coffee, which has a high reputation.
          Its capital is Sana (pop. 40,000) ; and its chief port
          is Mocha (pop. 7000). Aden (pop. 20,000), the great
          English packet-station on the route between Suez
          and India, stands on a peninsula of the Yemen
          coast. The Hedjaz is chiefly important as the
          country in which is situated Mecca (settled pop.
          45,000), the birthplace of Mohammed, and the
          seat of the Kaabah, an inclosure which contains
          the famous black stone which all pilgrims must
          kiss. Upwards of 100,000 men still assemble
          annually at Mecca from all parts of the Mohammedan
          East The state of Oman, in Eastern
          Arabia, is populous. Its chief town is the seaport
          of Muscat (pop. 60,000). The ruler is the Imaum,
          who has a considerable navy, and, till recently,
          exercised great power on the shores of Persia
          and Beloochistan, and the east coast of Africa.</p>

                <p>In dividing Asia into its great regions, we used
          the name India to describe the countries which
          lie south of the great mountain-wall of the Himalaya,
          and the mountains which continue it eastwards
          into Southern China. It consists of the
          two great promontories of Hindustan and Indo-
          China, and the Malay Islands. For an account
          of the last, we refer to AFRIKA - OCEANIA.</p>

            <div>
                <head>HINDUSTAN.</head>
                <p>It is often said that no country is so completely
          isolated from the rest of the world as Hindustan,
          by great natural barriers ; but perhaps the statement
          has been exaggerated, for in the East it is
          difficult to say whether Bhotan and Assam belong
          properly to it or to Tibet or Indo-China ; and in
          the west, Beloochistan is as much Indian as it is
          West Asian. We have already briefly referred to
          the great natural features of Hindustan. South of
          the Himalaya is an elevated terrace, which slopes
          towards the low plain of the Ganges. To it
          belong the hill-countries of Nepaul, and Bhotan,
          and Assam, which are separated from the low
          plain on the west by the great pestilential swamp
          or forest of the Terai, and on the east by the
          forests which clothe the Garrow Hills. The Vindhyan
          Mountains bound on the north the long
          and narrow valley of the Nerbudda, which falls
          into the Gulf of Cambay. The table-land of the
          Deccan lies south of them. It forms an undulating table-land, 2000 feet above the level of the
          sea. The Western Ghauts bound it on the west,
          leaving between them and the sea a narrow plain
          30 or 40 miles in width. They are 2000 feet high
          in the north ; but in the south, at the Neilgherries,
          have an elevation of 9000 feet. The Eastern
          Ghauts have a lower elevation, and are situated at
          a greater distance from the sea. The table-land
          of Malwah, 2000 feet above the level of the sea,
          extends from the Deccan towards the Aravilli
          Hills. Farther north, extends the plain of India.
          The Thur, or Indian Desert, separates the basin
          of the Indus from that of the Ganges, and the
          Upper from the Lower Indus. North of it lies
          the Punjab ; south of it, Sinde, separated from
          Gujerat by the Runn of Cutch. The basin of the
          Ganges is divided into two parts at a point east
          of Benares, where the plain is contracted by a
          ridge running eastward from the plateau of the
          Deccan. West of this line, the plain is described
          as that of Hindustan proper ; east of it, is that
          of Bengal.</p>
                <p>The soil of India is fertile in almost all these
          districts where it is well watered. The Deccan,
          like other table-lands, does not support great
          forests ; but its soil and climate are favourable to
          the growth of cotton and the grain plants. The
          great plains of the Indus and Ganges, where
          watered, are very productive, and it has been found
          possible by irrigation to increase their fertility to a
          wonderful extent, and, accordingly, the greatest
          efforts are now being made by the government
          to encourage the formation of irrigation canals,
          especially on the Indus and Western Ganges, and
          the plateau of the Deccan. The consequence has
          been, to avert to a great extent the recurrence
          of those famines which from time immemorial at
          intervals depopulated India.</p>
                <p>Hindustan is rather a continent than a country,
          in the European sense of the term, and its inhabitants
          are in every stage of civilisation. In the
          most inaccessible districts, protected by dense
          forests, tribes linger in the first stages of human progress;
          but generally the natives are agriculturists,
          remarkable for their contented, sober, and
          industrious habits. A description of the lower
          classes in Bengal probably gives a tolerably correct
          impression of the general condition of the Indian
          population. It is stated that, in Bengal, the ordinary
          habitations of the people are built of mud, or of
          brushwood plastered over with mud. The frames
          consist of bamboos tied together, and the roofs
          are constructed of two sloping sides, which meet
          at the top in a ridge. There is no window or
          aperture except the doorway. Each hut is concealed
          by thick vegetation, to keep off the sun, and
          each has a patch of ground in which vegetables
          are cultivated. These, rice, and occasionally fish,
          supply the ordinary food. The only dress of the
          men consists of a turban, and a cloth fastened
          round the waist, and reaching to the knees. The
          dress of the women is more elaborate and elegant,
          and even the poorest of them have armlets of
          silver or brass. Of course, this description does
          not apply to all the people of India, or to the
          landlords of Bengal, who are often enormously
          rich. The position of the peasantry in different
          districts of India has been very much influenced
          by the systems of tenure of the land which prevail
          in them. These may be classed under three<pb n="40"/>heads - the village, zemindary, and ryot systems.
          Under the first, which seems to have belonged
          to the earliest period of Hindu civilisation, the
          country was divided into villages or districts, the
          inhabitants of which formed an association, in
          which all trades and official duties were discharged by members, who received as a reward
          part of the produce of the soil. The potail, or
          general manager, collected the revenue, and paid
          it. The system chiefly prevails in the North-west
          Provinces. The second system seems to have
          sprung from the Mohammedan conquest. The
          collection of the revenue in many places was
          intrusted by the conquerors to a class of taxcollectors
          known as zemindars. They gradually
          acquired a hereditary right to act in this capacity,
          and being intrusted also with the administration
          of justice, they were supposed, by the English
          rulers of India, to be landed proprietors, and were
          accordingly recognised as such. The third or
          ryotwary system is that under which rents are
          paid by the ryots, or peasants, under leases, direct
          to the government. The zemindary system was
          that adopted in Bengal by Lord Cornwallis in
          1793. The ryotwary system was favoured in
          Madras by Sir Thomas Munro, when governor of
          the presidency. It was afterwards extended to
          Bombay. The fact seems so far to explain the
          poverty of the peasant in Bengal. All over India,
          the formation of railways and other public works<pb n="41"/>has wonderfully helped to benefit the working-classes,
          who have secured and retained for their
          own use the wages paid to them.</p>
                <p>The north-eastern part of India, or the Punjab,
          belongs to the warm temperate zone, and in it the
          chief products are wheat, flax, and hemp. Wheat
          is the grain of the Upper Ganges. Where there
          is too little moisture for its cultivation, as in the
          southern basin of the Indus, millet and maize are
          grown. Rice is cultivated in the irrigated parts of
          the Punjab and in Bengal. Cotton is produced
          in all parts of India, and opium in Oude and
          Bahar. The commerce of India is chiefly with
          the United Kingdom. In 1872, the value of the
          imports was £42,651,560 ; of exports, £64,661,940.
          The chief exports were: cotton, £12,862,500;
          rice, £3,432,o58 ; indigo, £1,905,132 ; tea,
          £1,398,106. The chief imports were : cotton
          goods, £13,078,831 ; iron, raw and manufactured,
          £956,921. In 1872, the revenue of India amounted
          to £50,110,215. Of this income, £20,520,337 was
          derived from land revenue, £9,253,859 from
          opium, and £5,966,595 from a tax on salt, and
          £2,369,109 from the excise on spirits and drugs.
          The chief item of expenditure was the army,
          £156,781,121. In 1881, the imports were
          £62,105,000; the exports, £76,000,000; revenue,
          £72,560,000 ; expenditure, £76,604,000 ; debt
          in India, £86,000,000 ; and in Great Britain,
          £71,400,000. The European army had 64,500
          men ; the native army, 126,000.</p>
                <p>The government of India, in 1858, was transferred
          from the East India Company to the English
          crown, by an act passed in that year <q>for
            the better government of India.</q> The executive
          authority of India is now exercised by a viceroy,
          appointed by the crown, and acting under the
          orders of the Secretary of State for India. A
          supreme council sits at Calcutta, and consists of
          six members, including the viceroy; an imperial
          legislative council, consisting of the supreme
          council and additional members ; and separate
          councils for Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. The
          chief officers of the crown after the governor-general
          are governors in Madras and Bombay ;
          lieutenant-governors in Bengal, the North-west
          Provinces, and the Punjab ; and chief commissioners
          in Assam, the Central Provinces, and
          British Burmah.</p>
                <p>A census of India was taken during the years
          1868-1872, and another in 1881. By the latter
          the population under British administration was
          198,755,993; in the native states, 55,150,456 -
          total 253,906,449. The tables give the results of
          the last census.</p>

                <p>There were 87 millions of Hindus, 50 millions of
          Mohammedans, 3 1/2 millions of Buddhists (mostly
          in British Burmah), 85,000 Parsees, and 12,000
          Jews ; and 89,798 British-born persons.</p>
                <p>India is inhabited by races in all stages of
          human progress. Wild tribes, in the lowest state
          of savagery, occupy the hills and forests, and
          form a strange contrast with the civilised peoples
          of the plains. The latter belong to three races :
          (1) Mongols, resembling in all respects their
          neighbours, the Burmese and the Tibetans ; (2)
          Dravidians, a dark race, totally differing from
          Mongols in appearance, and occupying the chief
          part of the Deccan ; (3) Aryans, so called because
          believed to be the result of an amalgamation of
          the primitive inhabitants with Aryan invaders
          who at a remote period entered India from the
          north-west, just as the Saxons invaded England,
          The chief language of the first group is the
          Tibetan of Bhotan. The Dravidian languages
          are more important. Tamil is spoken by 10
          millions of people south of Madras ; Telinga by
          8 millions north of the same point ; Canarese in
          Mysore and Malayalam on the coast of Malabar.
          Among the Aryan languages are (1) Hindi, the
          vernacular of the North-western Provinces or
          Hindustan Proper ; (2) Punjabi ; (3) Gujerati;
          (4) Maharati ; (5) Bengali - the names of which
          sufficiently explain the parts of India to which
          they belong. It is the Hindus (by religion) who
          speak the various Dravidian and Aryan languages
          we have just enumerated ; and they in each province
          differ not only in language, but in character
          and habits, and even in dress. The Mohammedans,
          on the other hand, speak only one language,
          the Hindustani or Urdu, a modified Hindi
          intermixed with Persian, which sprang up at the
          court of Delhi, and which has become the spoken
          and literary language of the Mohammedans all
          over India.</p>
                <p>In 1879, there were 1391 publications received
          in the Bengal Library, of which 983 were published
          in the town of Calcutta. In the Bombay presidency,
          1097 native publications were issued ; in
          Madras, 824 ; in the North-west Provinces, 541;
          in the Punjab, 926.</p>
                <p>What is known or conjectured of the early history
          of Hindustan is to be gathered from the history
          of the two dominant religions (see <ref target="#MOHAMM">MOHAMMEDANISM - HINDUISM - 
          BUDDHISM</ref> ; also HISTORY OF ANCIENT NATIONS), In the 11th and 12th centuries.
          Buddhism had almost entirely disappeared
          in Hindustan, or was confined only to the hilly
          districts south of the Himalaya, to Ceylon, and
          the countries of Indo-China and Malaya, in
          which it had taken root and flourished. It was<pb n="42"/>in the beginning of this period that another faith
          was introduced into India. In loo1, Mahmoud,
          the Mohammedan sultan of Ghuznee, in Eastern
          Iran, commenced his successful expeditions into
          India, and he continued them till 1029, making
          the destruction of pagan idolatry more the object
          of his visits than the acquisition of wealth or
          power. By his successors the Mohammedan
          dominion was established. Genghis Khan and
          Timur invaded India. In 1397, the latter sacked
          Delhi, and proclaimed himself emperor of India.
          He was followed by Baber, who, in 1526, entered
          Delhi, and had himself proclaimed successor of
          Timur and emperor of India. Baber established
          the dynasty of the Mogul emperors, or Great
          Moguls. One of these was Akbar, who flourished
          between the years 1556 and 1605. By his
          daring and judicious management, the central
          provinces were preserved in complete tranquillity,
          and Gujerat, Bengal, and part of the Deccan
          were added to his already extensive empire. His
          descendant, Aurungzebe, became Mogul emperor
          in 1658. He imprisoned his father, and, in the
          most unscrupulous manner, usurped the imperial
          power. He raised the Mogul empire to its highest
          point of splendour, and by sacrifice of the treasure
          amassed at his frugal court, for the relief of a
          great famine, so far atoned for the crimes of his
          youth. He died in 1707, and the decay of the
          Mogul empire followed. It was weakened by the
          growth of a power among the Mahrattas in
          the countries lying to the east of the Gulf of
          Cambay. They represented the Hindus, as
          opposed to the Mohammedans of Delhi, and
          formed several states. On the invasion of India
          by Nadir Shah, they succeeded in wresting a large
          territory from the Mogul emperors. The strife
          between them and the Mohammedans was terminated
          by the growth of a new power in India -
          that of the English. In 1498, the route to India
          had been discovered by the Portuguese, and in
          that year they landed in Malabar, and established
          themselves there. Their chief settlement was
          Goa. The Dutch next opened a direct trade with
          India, and they were followed by the English and
          the French.</p>
                <p>The English desired to open a commercial
          intercourse with India as early as 1553 ; but
          their expeditions failed in reaching the country,
          from their want of geographical knowledge. They
          at length learned which was the true course to
          steer for India ; whereupon, in 1600, a Company
          of merchants was formed in London to prosecute
          the traffic with the East, being empowered to
          do so by a charter from Queen Elizabeth, which
          was to last fifteen years. The first expedition of
          these adventurers cost £69,091, and consisted
          of five ships, the largest of which was 600, and
          the smallest 130 tons burden. The articles which
          they took were principally bullion, iron, tin,
          broadcloths, cutlery, and glass. This expedition
          proved remarkably successful, and led immediately
          to a repetition of annual voyages of the same
          nature. Unsuccessful attempts were made to
          secure favour with the Mogul emperor ; but the
          affairs of the Company continued prosperous, and
          factories or warehouses for storing exports and
          imports were in many places planted on the coasts
          of India. From the real or pretended dread of
          being attacked by marauders, the keepers, merchants,
          and servants at these places at length
          began to strengthen the defences ; and so, from
          being mere mercantile warehouses, the factories
          shortly partook of the decided character of armed
          garrisons. In 1640, the native authorities gave
          permission to build Fort St George at Madras ; and in 1645, a factory was established on the
          banks of the Hooghly, a branch of the Ganges
          near its mouth, which formed the foundation of
          Calcutta. The island of Bombay was also procured
          as a settlement in 1664-65, after a struggle
          with its Portuguese possessors.</p>
                <p>The French, who had acquired considerable territorial
          possessions in Southern Hindustan, came
          into collision with the British merchants. It would
          be needless to recount the particulars of the
          struggle for power ; it will suffice to state that
          the French ultimately were deprived of their
          possessions. By the defeat of the French forces
          in 1761, the British were left at liberty to pursue
          their schemes on India. Calcutta had in the
          meanwhile rapidly advanced in wealth, and
          excited the envy of the Subahdar of Bengal,
          Suraja Dowlah. He attacked it in 1756, and
          capturing 146 prisoners, confined them in the
          memorable Black Hole, in which all but 23 were
          suffocated. Clive hastened from Madras to the
          rescue of Calcutta, and defeated Suraja Dowlah
          at the battle of Plassey, 1757. The Mogul
          emperors then appointed the Company dewannee,
          or perpetual collector of Bengal, Bahar, and
          Orissa, on payment of £260,000 per annum. In
          1777, the French again made India the scene of
          a war with England. A Mohammedan adventurer,
          named Hyder Ali, also had established his
          power as sovereign in the southern part of the
          Deccan; and the Mahrattas, aided by French
          officers, attacked the English ; but the confederacy
          was broken up in 1781, when Hyder Ali was
          defeated by Sir Eyre Coote. In 1790, Lord Cornwallis,
          with the Mahrattas and others, made war
          on Tippoo, the son of Hyder Ali. He, too, was
          defeated, and was compelled to cede half of
          his dominions to England. The principal war
          in which the East India Company was engaged
          after this successful contest, was that with the
          Pindarees, roving tribes of Mahrattas, who, without
          any territory, carried on predatory warfare
          against all whom they could rob with impunity.</p>
                <p>The chief events in the more recent history of
          India may be referred to under the heads of the
          successive administrations. Lord Auckland was
          governor-general from 1835 to 1842, and under
          his rule the disastrous Afghan policy was adopted
          which led to the massacre of an English army
          in the Khyber Pass. Lord Ellenborough succeeded
          him. In his time, Afghanistan was
          invaded, and Cabul sacked ; Sinde was also
          conquered by Sir Charles Napier, and annexed.
          Sir Henry Hardinge was governor from 1844 to
          1848. His administration was remarkable for the
          Sikh war, the result of which was the conquest
          of the Punjab. Under the governorship of Lord
          Dalhousie (1848-55), the Punjab, Nagpur, and
          Oude were annexed. Lord Canning's administration
          was the period of the great mutiny of 1857-58.
          It is now believed to have been a Mohammedan
          conspiracy. The last of the Great Moguls, the
          king of Delhi, and heir of Timur, took part in
          the conspiracy, and was in consequence tried,
          and sentenced <q>to be transported across the seas
            as a felon.</q> He died in Pegu in 1862. One<pb n="43"/>consequence of the Indian mutiny was a determination
          on the part of the English people that India
          should be ruled for the benefit of the Indian
          population. The government was transferred from
          the East India Company to the crown, Queen
          Victoria assuming the title of Empress of India.
          The new administration already referred to was
          then called into existence. Since then, great
          irrigation works, canals for traffic, railways, and
          telegraphs, have been constructed in all parts of
          India ; every effort has been made to promote
          agriculture, and, by the foundation of schools
          and colleges, to spread education. We shall now
          glance hurriedly at the various divisions of the
          country, which may be conveniently arranged
          under the three heads of Western Hindustan,
          Eastern Hindustan, and the Deccan.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>1. Western Hindustan.</head>
                <p>Its principal divisions are :</p>
                <p>1. Cashmere, a mountainous country of the
          Western Himalaya, ruled over by Ranbir Singh,
          who is bound by treaty to furnish troops to the
          British government if required. The chief portion
          is a valley 50 miles long, 10 or 12 miles wide, and
          5300 feet above the sea. The soil is fertile and
          productive, and the country is one of the most
          beautiful in the world. The capital, Cashmere,
          has a population of 200,000.</p>
                <p>2. The Punjab, consisting chiefly of a plain
          traversed by tributaries of the Indus, which divide
          it into great natural sections called Doabs. Where
          there is water for irrigation, the country is fertile.
          The population by census of 1881 is 18 1/2
          millions. The inhabitants are chiefly Sikhs, and
          speak Punjabi. West of the Indus, the Patans, or
          Afghans, are more numerous ; two-thirds of them
          are Mohammedans, one-sixth profess the Sikh
          religion, the rest are Hindus. The Sikhs have
          no distinction of caste. Lahore (pop. 150,000)
          is the chief commercial town of North-western
          India. Mooltan (pop. 68,000) is one of the oldest
          Indian towns.</p>
                <p>3. Rajpootana lies south of the Punjab. It is
          a fertile hill-country on the east, but on the west
          extends over the Thur, or Indian Desert. It is
          divided into 18 independent states, with 9 millions
          of inhabitants. They are all under the political
          superintendence of an agent of the governor-general.
          The inhabitants are Hindus, and speak
          dialects resembling the Hindi. In consequence
          of the rule of so many native princes, and their
          independent interests, no great public works are
          carried out, but in many places English schools
          have been founded. Bhurtpore (pop. 66,000) is
          the chief town.</p>
                <p>4. Sinde (pop. above 2 millions), at the mouth
          of the Indus, has a hot and dry climate. The
          country is rich, and produces two crops a year
          near the river; but to the east, it becomes an
          absolute desert. The trade of the country is
          rapidly increasing. The capital is Hyderabad
          (pop. 48,000) ; the chief port, Kurrachee, is familiar
          to Englishmen as a chief packet-station.</p>
                <p>5. Gujerat, a flat and fertile country (pop. 3
          millions). The ruling race is the Mahrattas. It
          includes many petty states, the chief of which
          is that of the Guicowar. Baroda (pop. 101,000)
          has a great trade.</p>
                <p>6. Malwah is a name given to the elevated
          country lying north of the Vindhyan Mountains.
          It is divided into a number of principalities, the
          chief of which are : Indore, or Holkar's dominion ;
          Gwalior, or Scindia's dominion ; Bhopal ; Bundelcund,
          &amp;c.</p>
                <p>7. The North-west Provinces (of Bengal) are
          so called because they were included in the
          presidency of Bengal. They, however, form no
          part of Bengal in a geographical sense, and
          might be better described as Hindustan Proper.
          They form a great plain, divided by the Jumna
          and the Ganges, bounded on the north by
          the Terai, a narrow tract of forests and pestilential
          swamps, infested with wild beasts ; on the
          south, by the elevated tract of Bundelcund. The
          plain is arid in the west near the desert, but
          better watered in the east. Costly canals have
          recently been constructed, which have marvellously
          increased the productiveness of the country. The
          people speak Hindi ; but both that language and
          Hindustani, or Urdu, are taught in the schools.
          The common people live on chupatties, or unleavened
          wheaten cakes. Their dress is rather
          fuller than that of the Bengalees ; and their houses,
          which resemble those of the latter, are covered
          with tiles instead of thatch. They are Hindus
          and Mussulmans. Among the chief towns of the
          country may be included Delhi, which, for administrative
          purposes, is now annexed to the Punjab.
          Delhi, however, belongs to the Upper Ganges.
          It had in the time of Aurungzebe a population of
          2 millions. The number of its present inhabitants
          is only 173,000. It still contains splendid
          mosques, and the imperial palace is half a mile
          in circuit. In the width and cleanliness of its
          streets, Delhi appears like a European town. It
          anciently occupied 20 square miles, and that space
          is now covered with ruins. Near Agra (pop.
          160,000) is the famous Taj Mahal. Benares (pop.
          199,000) is the holy city of the Hindus. It is
          filled with numberless temples and palaces, and
          is visited by pilgrims from all parts of India.
          Oude, which previously formed a separate province,
          was joined to the North-west Provinces in
          1877. It resembles them in soil and climate.
          Lucknow (pop. 261,000) is the chief town.</p>

                <head>2. Eastern Hindustan.</head>
                <p>1. In this division are included the lower provinces
          of Bengal. They form an alluvial plain,
          unsurpassed in the world for luxuriance of vegetation -
          from one end to the other is, indeed, one
          enormous garden. Rice is the chief object of
          cultivation, but all the other grains are grown.
          The opium poppy, indigo, cotton, the sugar-cane,
          the mulberry, tobacco, hemp, and flax form the
          other chief objects of cultivation. On the north,
          the plain is bounded by the great forest which
          runs along the base of the Himalaya, and which
          is infested with wild beasts. Its inhabitants are
          chiefly Bengalees, the great majority of whom are
          agriculturists. They are very poor, a great part
          of the wealth of the country passing into the
          hands of the <hi rend="italic">zemindars</hi>, or aristocracy. The
          peasants are said to be <q>as innocent, temperate,
          and moral as the people of any country in the
          world.</q> They are also said to be destitute of
          manly spirit and independence of character.
          Calcutta (pop. 800,000) is the capital of Bengal,
          and the seat of the supreme government. The<pb n="44"/>European portion is described as the City of
          Palaces. Behind it is ranged the native town,
          deep, black, and dingy, with various crooked
          streets, huts of earth baked in the sun, or of
          twisted bamboos, interspersed here and there with
          ruinous brick bazaars, pools of dirty water, cocoatrees,
          and little gardens, with some fine large
          dirty houses, the residences of wealthy natives.</p>
                <p>2. Assam is remarkable as the chief seat of
          the cultivation of tea, which it now sends in very
          large quantities to the Calcutta market.</p>
                <p>3. Of Nepaul and Bhotan, native states, in
          which Buddhism still prevails, we shall not stop

            <div>
                <head>3. The Deccan, or Southern Hindustan.</head>
                <p>The chief divisions of this part of India are :</p>
                <p>1. The Bombay presidency proper, which lies
          at the north-eastern corner of the table-land of
          the Deccan, and includes the Ghauts and the
          sea-coast from the Gulf of Cambay south to the
          town of Goa, and a long tract of the tableland.
          It produces cotton, rice, and millet.
          The labouring population are rapidly improving
          their condition, thanks chiefly to railway
          and European works. Mahratta and Canarese
          are the chief languages of the people, who
          profess Hinduism. The capital, Bombay (pop.
          800,000), is spread over a considerable surface,
          the houses of the wealthier European inhabitants
          standing apart among gardens and orchards.
          In the native town, the houses are small,
          and the streets narrow and crowded. Bombay
          is the seat of a great trade with Europe
          by the Suez Canal, and with the Persian Gulf. Its
          population is of the most varied character. The
          Parsees, who are descended from Persian ancestors,
          who left their native country to escape Mohammedan
          persecution, are the most remarkable section
          of the population. They adhere to their
          old religion, and conduct, as merchants, a great
          share of the business of Western India. Poonah
          (pop. 130,000), which stands at an elevation of
          2000 feet, is an important military post.</p>
                <p>2. The Madras presidency, which occupies a
          great part of the eastern slope of the Deccan. The
          alluvial tracts watered and irrigated by the
          Godavery and Krishna, and other rivers, supply
          great crops of rice ; maize and sugar are also
          cultivated. Along the coast and in sandy districts,
          the cocoa-nut and other palm trees are cultivated.
          The population exceeds 31 millions. The chief
          languages are Telugu and Tamil. The chief
          religion is Hinduism, and Brahmans are more
          numerous in the presidency than elsewhere in
          India. The Mohammedans are not numerous.
          Madras (pop. 406,000) is the seat of government.
          The shore is here low, and dangerous to approach
          by vessels, which have to load and discharge by
          means of boats, pulled through a heavy surf. On
          the beach stands Fort St George, a place of considerable
          strength. A noble range of public edifices,
          including a custom-house and court-house,
          also adorns what is called the north beach.
          Madras differs in appearance from Calcutta. It
          has properly no European town, the settlers residing
          in houses in the suburbs, in the midst of
          gardens, and transacting business in the district
          appropriated to the residence of the natives.</p>
                <p>3. The Central Provinces, which have a population
          of 9 millions, more backward than any in India, and consisting of Mahrattas, Mohammedans,
          and Gonds. A great proportion of the
          people, including those last named, dwell in rude
          huts in the forests, and subsist by the chase.
          Nagpoor, the capital (pop. 98,000), consists chiefly
          of mud huts. It has only one good street.</p>
                <p>4. Hyderabad, the name now given to the
          dominions of the Nizam of the Deccan. The
          state has a population of 10 millions. The climate
          is one of the most salubrious in India.
          The soil is arid, but, when irrigated, produces fine
          crops. Hyderabad, the capital of this native
          state, has a pop. of 354,000.</p>

                <head>Ceylon.</head>
                <p>The island of Ceylon, though closely connected
          with British India, and also a British possession,
          is administratively distinct, under its own governor.
          Ceylon is a rich and beautiful island, rising
          in the centre to a table-land, round which runs
          a low belt of coast plains. The population is
          above two and a half millions. The chief inhabitants
          are the Singhalese, who occupy the
          south and south-west coasts. They are Buddhists
          in the interior, Christians on the coast. In the
          north-east, there is a Tamil population, who are
          Hindus. Colombo (pop. 40,000) is the residence
          of the governor. Point de Galle (pop. 18,000)
          is the point at which the Indian and Australian
          steamers touch. Ceylon was successively Portuguese,
          Dutch, and English.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>INDO-CHINA.</head>
                <p>Indo-China forms a peninsula, bounded on
          three sides by the sea. It has not a well-marked
          frontier on the north. It consists of a table-land
          with an elevation of from 5000 to 6000 feet, and
          traversed by lofty mountain-chains, which, as they
          run south, spread out like fingers. The basins
          they form correspond, or nearly so, with the old
          political divisions - Burmah, Siam, Cambodia, and
          Cochin-China. The whole country lies within
          the tropical zone ; but the northern table-land
          has a temperate climate. The whole peninsula is
          copiously watered, and very fertile. The population,
          including the semi-independent Laos or
          Shan states in the interior, is about 40 millions.
          The inhabitants (save in the long peninsula of
          Malacca, where they are Malays) are of Mongolian
          stock, speaking languages resembling
          the Chinese, but divided into five groups : (1)
          the Anamese, spoken in Tonquin and Cochin-
          China ; (2) the Cambodian ; (3) the Siamese ;
          (4) the Burmese ; (5) the Mon, a dialect spoken
          in the delta of the Irrawadi. In the east, the
          inhabitants in their personal appearance and
          habits resemble the Chinese most closely. In
          the west, they have been much influenced by the
          languages and civilisation of India.</p>
                <p>The chief countries are Burmah, Siam, and
        Anam.</p>
                <p>1. Burmah includes the basins of the Irrawadi
          and Saluen, and a narrow plain to the north and
          south of them running along the Gulf of Bengal.
          The lowland country forms an elevated tract, much
          of which lies at an elevation of 2000 feet. The
          maritime provinces are low and damp, with a
          rich soil. They are not, however, well cultivated.
          Rice is the chief product. In the towns, the manufacture
          of pottery, silver ornaments, and jewellery,<pb n="45"/>are the chief occupations of the people. The
          government of Burmah is hereditary and despotic.
          In 1823, the Burmese invaded British India ; a war
          ensued. At its close, they were compelled to cede
          Aracan. Tenasserim was annexed in 1826, after
          a second war with Burmah. In 1852, Pegu, the
          delta of the Irrawadi, also became English.
          The whole of these territories were thrown into
          one province, described as British Burmah, and
          placed under the government of India. The
          kingdom of Ava, or Burmah Proper, is now
          an inland country. The old capital, Ava, is now
          deserted for Mandalay (pop. 70,000), on the right
          bank of the Irrawadi. Of late years the state of
          the kingdom has bordered upon anarchy. The
          population is about 4 millions.</p>
                <p>The coast regions, Aracan, Pegu, Irrawadi, and
          Tenasserim, now forming British Burmah, are
          governed by a chief commissioner under the
          Indian government. All the towns are situated
          on navigable rivers, and no roads existed till they
          were constructed by the English. The land is
          divided into small estates of from 8 to 10 acres,
          held directly from the government. The houses
          of the peasantry are built of bamboos, and have
          floors raised on platforms, so as to be above
          reach of the annual floods. Since the English
          occupation, Europeans, Chinese, and Hindus
          have settled in large numbers in British Burmah,
          and carry on a large trade in rice, timber, and
          petroleum, and the other products of the country.
          The town of Aracan (pop. 15,000) carries on a
          large trade with Calcutta. Rangoon (pop. 134,000)
          is the most important town in Pegu. It has a
          large and rapidly increasing commerce Moulmein
          (pop. 53,000), the chief town of Tenasserim,
          well drained and healthy, with fine wide streets,
          carries on a great trade in timber.</p>
                <p>2. Siam (pop. 6 millions) almost coincides with
          the basin of the Meinam. In the interior and
          elevated tracts, the climate is healthy ; but in the
          lower region, which is overspread with forests,
          fevers prevail. The soil is exceedingly fertile,
          and rice, sugar, and tobacco are extensively
          cultivated. Chinese and Anamese colonists form
          one-third of the whole population, and are largely
          engaged in ship-building, and the mechanical arts
          and commerce. The government is shared by two
          kings, one of whom is said to be supreme, and
          the other subordinate ; the former having two-thirds,
          and the latter one-third, of the power.
          Bankok (pop. 500,000, one-third of whom are
          Chinese), the present capital, is built on both
          sides of a mouth of the Meinam ; carries on a
          large and increasing trade by sea with Singapore
          and China, in pepper and tobacco and
          other products. The Siamese concluded a treaty
          with England in 1826, which led to friendly relations,
          ever since maintained. In 1881, the total
          exports from Bangkok amounted to £2,000,000, of
          imports, £1,200,000, about half of this trade being
          carried on in British and the other half in Siamese
          vessels. The chief export is rice ; the chief imports,
          cloths, hardware, and opium.</p>
                <p>3. Anam (pop. estimated at 24 millions) includes
          Cochin-China, Tonquin, and Cambodia. A mountain-
          chain traverses it from north to south, bounded
          on the west by the basin of the Cambodia River;
          on the east, by the coast slope of the China Sea.
          On the north, the sea-board widens into the
          broad plain of Tonquin ; on the south, forming
          the basin of the Cambodia into a broad delta.
          The products are rice, sugar, silk, pepper, and
          other spices. Tea of an inferior kind is also cultivated in the elevated tracts. The inhabitants
          closely resemble the Chinese, and are skilful
          ship-builders and mechanics. Roman Catholic
          missions had made, in spite of fearful persecutions,
          half a million of converts. A massacre of
          Christians broke out in 1857, which led to war;
          and Lower Cochin-China became permanently a
          French possession. Subsequently, Cambodia accepted
          the French protectorate. In 1883, France
          further occupied Tonquin ; and ultimately the
          <q>empire</q> of Anam has become practically a
          French dependency. Chief towns: in Anam or
          Cochin-China Proper, Hué (pop. 30,000) ; in
          French Cochin-China, Saigon (pop. 70,000) ; in
          Tonquin, Hanoi or Kesho (pop. 120,000).</p>
                <p>The highlands of Indo-China form the Chinese
          province of Yun-nan, with a population of 5,600,000
          inhabitants. It comprises a Mussulman population,
          known as the Panthays, who were recently in
          insurrection, but whose rebellion was erelong completely
          suppressed. Yun-nan is the great mining
          province of China, from which it is scarcely possible
          to reach it over the mountains and gorges
          by which it is traversed. Hence the vast importance
          of the new route up the Tonquin River,
          discovered recently by the French, by which
          steamers can reach the heart of the country.
          English attempts to open a route for trade to
          Yun-nan through Burmah have been unfortunate
          in their main purpose.</p>

            <div>
                <head>THE CHINESE COUNTRIES.</head>
                <p>We have included under this name the whole
          of that part of Asia lying north of the Himalaya
          and the Gulf of Tonquin, and south and west
          of the Gobi. The area thus defined includes
          Tibet, China, Corea, and Japan. It is, as we
          have already seen, for the most part an elevated
          region. The loftiest table-land on the surface of
          the globe occupies its western angle, and stretches
          eastward towards China, where it passes into
          a country covered with parallel chains running
          south-west and north-east. North of this region,
          the Mongol table-land sinks into broad riverbasins,
          and finally to the great plain of China,
          where the two chief Chinese rivers, the Yang-tze-kiang
          and the Hoang-ho, meet, and fall into the
          ocean. Corea is a promontory traversed by a
          range of lofty hills. The Japanese islands are
          rugged, but slope on the east to comparatively level
          tracts. The Chinese countries lie almost entirely
          within the warm temperate zone. South of the
          Nan-ling chain, however, China has a tropical
          climate, while north of Niphon the climate of Japan
          is that of the temperate zone. The inhabitants of
          the Chinese countries all belong to the Mongol
          race ; but the Japanese and Coreans differ widely
          from each other, and from the Tibetans and the
          Chinese, in appearance as well as in language.
          All, however, have been influenced by a common
          civilisation, which connects them like the countries
          of the European continent</p>

            <div>
                <head>CHINA.</head>
                <p>The whole peninsula between the Gulfs of
          Tonquin and Pe-che-le, bounded by the Tibetan
          plateau and the Mongol Desert on the west and<pb n="46"/>north, and the sea on the east, has long been inhabited
          by one race, and united under one government,
          that of China. We have long been familiar
          with the coast region ; but it is only within the last
          few years that the German traveller, Baron von
          Richthofen, has given us correct general notions
          of the geography of the interior. He has shewn
          that the chains represented in our maps are purely
          conventional. Southern China is a region of
          parallel mountain-chains running north-east and
          south-west, and the summits of which do not
          exceed, in general, an elevation of from 2000 to
          3500 feet. No great plain is met with over this
          area, and the rivers which cross it pass from
          valley to valley between the parallel ridges by
          deep gorges. The streams thus run to and fro
          through the valleys to turn a barrier, and
          their courses are, in consequence, sluggish. On
          the north and west of the Chinese extension
          of the Kuen Lun, there is another system of
          mountains, running north-east and south-west,
          which separates China and the Mongolian plateau.
          This country sinks eastward into extended
          plateaux and broad valleys, covered with tertiary
          deposits, and finally into the great plain of China,
          into which flows the Yellow River. A great movement
          of upheaval is believed to be taking place
          on the northern coasts of the Chinese plain,
          which is damming up the mouths of the great
          streams, destroying their embankments and the
          canals fed from them, and thus causing inundations
          and a wide-spread misery, which has been
          the source of much of the present weakness of
          the government of Pekin. China south of the
          Kuen Lun, that is to say, the southern hill-country,
          is well cultivated in the valleys, and its hills are
          clad to the top with luxuriant vegetation. Everywhere
          the river-bottoms yield crops of the finest
          rice, and the hills, tea. Silk is also produced in
          large quantities. In the northern division of
          China, the surface is covered either with a rich
          and deep tertiary deposit, or with an alluvial soil,
          both of which are exceedingly fertile. There are
          bare ridges rising out of these, but they do not
          cover a great area. The northern river-basins
          and the great plain produce the finest crops of
          grain and vegetables. In addition to these products,
          the southern parts of the plain produce
          tobacco and cotton.</p>
                <p>The government is despotic. The emperor is
          absolute in the empire ; his governors, in the
          provinces. The emperor is assisted in governing
          by two councils, and his decisions are regularly
          published in the <hi rend="italic">Pekin Gazette</hi>. A system of
          competitive examination exists in China, by which
          the most able men are supposed to be sifted from
          the general population, for employment as officers
          in the public service or mandarins.</p>
                <p>A return published in 1844, and not very reliable,
          gives the revenue of China as £63,934,713.
          No statement of the expenditure is given in the
          public accounts, and it appears that the governors
          of provinces have constantly to make up deficiencies
          by extraordinary demands on the tax-payers.
          The trade of China is chiefly with the United
          Kingdom and India. The United States, as
          customers, stand next in importance. The exports
          in 1881 amounted to £20,000,000, and the imports
          to £25,660,000. The exports consist chiefly of tea,
          the value sent from the treaty ports to the United
          Kingdom in 1881 being £7,500,000.</p>
                <p>The Chinese, generally, are strong and energetic.
          At home, they exhibit a bigotry, pride,
          and contempt of foreigners which were supposed
          to indicate stupidity. But this is not
          the impression they produce in America and the
          colonies, where the belief now seems to gain
          ground, that if they make themselves acquainted
          with the European arts and sciences, and, above
          all, with the modern art of warfare, the English
          and Russians will find them formidable rivals in
          any struggle for the possession of Asia. Baron
          von Richthofen has shewn that the population is
          divided by the Kuen Lun into two sections. In
          the south, the sea-boards, and the hills which
          separate them from the interior, have also produced
          an effect; on language, and the dialects of
          Quang-tong and Fo-kien differ from that of the
          rest of China.</p>
                <p>Neither the extent nor the population of China
          are known with anything like certainty. According
          to the most reliable estimates, the empire, with its
          dependencies (Mantchuria, Mongolia, Tibet, and
          Corea), has an area of about 4,000,000 English
          square miles, with a population of 375,000,000.
          The area of China Proper is stated at 1,538,000
          square miles, with a population of 350,000,000. It
          is divided into eighteen provinces - Chih-le, Shantung,
          Shan-se, Honan, Keang-soo, Gan-hwuy, Keang-
          si, Foo-keen, Che-keang, Hoo-pih, Hunan,
          Shen-se, Kan-suh, Se-chuen, Kwang-tung or Canton,
          Kwang-si, Yun-nan, Kwei-choo.</p>
                <p>The history of China goes back to a very remote
          period ; but perhaps the first date that can be
          looked upon as historical was the erection of the
          Great Wall of China in 220 B.C. by the first
          emperor of the Tsin dynasty, as a barrier against
          the invasions of the Mongol Tatars. The same
          monarch is said to have conquered six nations,
          and appears to have extended his sway over the
          whole of China north of the Kuen Lun. About
          201, the race of Tsin was followed by that of Han.
          In 406 A.D. two chief kingdoms appear in China,
          the capital of one being Honan, and of the other
          Nankin. They were united in 585 ; but after
          this period, civil wars and Tatar massacres weakened
          the country. Kublai Khan conquered the
          whole country in 1279, and in his time it was that
          Europeans first became acquainted with it from
          the writings of Marco Polo. In 1368, the Mongols
          were expelled, and the Ming native dynasty
          succeeded. The Mantchus invaded China towards
          the middle of the 17th century, and in 1651 were
          in possession of the whole country. Since this
          time they have retained supreme power, but they
          seem to be gradually losing control over the
          distant provinces of the empire. One of the most
          formidable revolutions the Chinese government
          has recently had to encounter was that of the
          Tae-ping rebels, who, under their leader, Hung-sew-
          tseuen, marched to Nankin in 1850-53, and
          who were only put down with the assistance of
          the English and French in 1864. The Mantchus
          were less fortunate in the western provinces
          of the empire, where Kashgaria threw off their
          yoke, and for a time was independent under a
          Mohammedan Emir. In early times, the Chinese
          do not appear to have been hostile to intercourse
          with foreigners. It was the attempt to proselytise
          made by the Spaniards and Portuguese, in the
          16th century, that first excited their hostility to
          Europeans. For a long period, trade with England<pb n="47"/>was restricted to Canton ; but dissensions between
          the English and Chinese officials led to the war of
          1840-42, and a treaty of peace at its conclusion, by
          which five ports were thrown open to British trade.
          The war of 1857, and the capture of Pekin by the
          English and French in 1860, were followed by
          treaties under which the commerce of the country
          was to be fully opened up to Europeans, and
          Christians were to be protected in the open profession
          of their faith. It was subsequent to this
          treaty that European officers were permitted to
          drill the Chinese troops, and assist in putting
          down the Tae-ping rebellion. The Chinese government
          have not, however, given that assistance
          which was expected in opening up the
          commerce of the country.</p>
                <p>We may enumerate a few of the chief towns of
          China. Tching-tou-fou (pop. 800,000), the capital
          of Se-chuen, the province just referred to, is a
          beautiful and opulent city, with wide streets and
          handsome shops. The houses are brightly painted,
          and very clean, reminding the visitor of the cities
          of Chinese pictures, more than the dingier coast
          towns. Canton (pop. 1,600,000) stands in a fine
          country south of the Nan-ling chain. At the
          mouth of the Canton River is the small English
          island of Hong-kong, 8 miles long, and from 2 to
          6 broad. The chief town is Victoria, the best
          part of which is built after the European fashion.
          The population of the colony is 125,504, of whom
          2034 are Europeans. Nankin, the capital of the
          Ming dynasty, had formerly a population, it is
          believed, of from 500,000 to 1,000,000. Since its
          destruction by the Tae-pings, more than half of
          the city is in ruins. Shanghae (pop. 300,000), at
          the mouth of the Yang-tze-kiang, is now the most
          important city of the Chinese empire. It is the
          headquarters of British trade in China. Pekin
          (pop. 1,600,000), the modern capital of China, is
          divided into two parts, a commercial city on the
          south, and a Tatar city on the north, in which are
          situated the imperial palace and the government
          offices.</p>

                <head>COREA.</head>
                <p>Corea lies to the north-east of China. It consists
          chiefly of a peninsula traversed by a range of
          mountains. It has a climate severe in the north,
          but in the extreme south belonging, like China, to
          the warm temperate zone. It is well cultivated,
          and in most respects resembles a Chinese province.
          The Coreans, however, have a language and
          literature of their own. They have been accustomed
          to pay tribute to both China and Japan,
          but have not had much intercourse with Europeans.
          Lately, our acquaintance with this curious
          people and country has been much extended;
          and commercial treaties, opening certain ports to
          foreign commerce, were concluded with the United
          States in 1882, and with Great Britain in 1884.</p>

                <head>JAPAN.</head>
                <p>The Japanese archipelago consists of the islands
          of Honshiu, Shikoku, Kiushiu, and Yezo, and a
          large number of smaller islands which surround
          these. Their surface is generally very rugged -
          some mountains attaining a great height. In
          Honshiu, Fusiyama (12,500 feet) is a dormant
          volcano, and Asama-Yama (8300) an active one.
          The plains are most extensive on the eastern
          coast. The greater part of the archipelago lies
          within the warm temperate zone, but there is a
          very great difference between the climates of the
          northern and southern islands. The surface is
          everywhere well cultivated. The chief products
          are rice, barley, wheat, and potatoes, tobacco, tea,
          cotton, silk, and all the fruits and vegetables of
          Southern Europe. The domestic animals are not
          much reared ; buffaloes and oxen are only used
          for draught. In some manufactures, the Japanese
          have made great progress. Their paper, lackered
          and japanned wares, are unrivalled, and they excel
          in manufactures of silks and cottons, clocks, telescopes,
          and metallic goods generally. The area
          of Japan is about 150,000 square miles, the population
          35 or 36 millions. Ethnologists are rather
          puzzled to say to what section of the inhabitants
          of Asia they belong. They differ from
          the Mantchus, Chinese, Malays, and Esquimaux,
          and yet, in some respects, they resemble
          all these races. The spoken language of Japan
          entirely differs from the Chinese, but the Chinese
          classics form the basis of their literature. Japan
          was till quite recently an oligarchy governed by the
          daimios or nobles, and the Tycoon or head of the
          executive. A civil war which terminated in 1868,
          restored power to the Mikado, the representative
          of the old sovereigns, and since then Japan may
          be considered a monarchy.</p>
                <p>In 1542, the Portuguese settled in Japan; but
          there, as elsewhere, their attempts to proselytise
          led to strife, and they were expelled. In 1660,
          when the Dutch opened negotiations with the
          Japanese, they were allowed to send two ships
          annually for purposes of trade, but on condition
          that they should not interfere with the religion
          of the inhabitants. For two centuries and a
          half, the Dutch and Chinese had the monopoly
          of the Japanese trade. They were confined
          to a small island on the coast of Kiusiu, near
          Nagasaki. The government maintained its isolation
          until the islands were visited by the United
          States' expedition under Commodore Perry in
          1854, which obtained entrance to the port of
          Simoda. The English followed the example set
          them in 1858, and since then the commerce of
          Japan has been opened to Europeans. A great
          revolution has been brought about : English books
          have been translated into Japanese ; Japanese
          students have begun to frequent the European
          schools of medicine and law, our dockyards, and
          our engineering establishments ; not one European
          art or science is now neglected by them;
          and they bid fair, in a generation, to rise to the
          level of European progress.</p>
                <p>Yedo, now Tokio (pop. 823,000), the capital
          of Japan, covers a large space, 17 miles long, and
          10 broad ; this area, however, includes extensive
          gardens. Canals lined with trees traverse the
          principal streets.<pb n="48"/>

                    <term xml:id="HISBIBLE"/>HISTORY OF THE BIBLE.</head>
                <p>THE origin, nature, and authority of the
          books which constitute the Scriptures of
          the Old and New Testament, are questions of
          paramount importance for all Christendom, we
          may say for all the world. To these questions,
          various and conflicting answers have been, and
          continue to be given. What may be called the
          traditional view, or that which has always been
          held by nearly the whole Christian community, is
          familiar enough ; but it may here be stated afresh,
          in order to contrast it with that to which critical
          inquiry has led an increasing number of scholars
          in modern times. According to the prevailing
          belief, then, the Bible is a miscellany made up of
          66 tracts, written by about 40 different authors, the
          latest of whom is divided from the earliest by an interval
          of 2000 years; whilst there is a not less striking
          diversity in their locality and general condition -
          Moses, whom <cit>
                        <bibl>
                            <author>Bacon</author> calls </bibl>
                        <quote>'God's first pen,'</quote>
                    </cit> writing
          in the Arabian desert, for the immediate benefit
          of the Jews whom he had redeemed from Egypt,
          and was leading into Palestine ; and John writing
          in a rugged isle of the AEgean Sea, where he was
          the captive of a potentate not less unjust and cruel
          than any Pharaoh. The other sacred penmen
          were placed in equally diverse circumstances, and
          exhibited as great a disparity of rank and occupation.
          Some portions of the Bible are composed
          by David, the warrior-king, and by his magnificent
          son and successor ; and others by men filling the
          humblest spheres of life - Amos the herdsman,
          Peter the fisherman, and Matthew the despised
          sub-collector of customs. And yet the forty
          authors, so unlike each other in rank, education,
          and quality of intellect, and living apart in the
          wide intervals of which the two extremes embrace
          a period of 2000 years, write poems, histories,
          prophecies, and doctrinal and didactic pieces on
          morality and religion, distinguished by a marvellously
          perfect harmony in facts, views, sentiment,
          and spirit. Dealing in the utmost variety of
          manner, and for many different purposes, not
          with the trite themes and the familiar notions of
          contemporary literature, but with that vast and
          previously unknown circle of truth which is
          attached to a pure theology, and comprehends the
          creation, the fall of man, Jehovah's manifestations
          to, and covenant with, certain families, and then
          with a peculiar people, to prepare for the whole
          world's ransom and regeneration, there is a complete
          agreement whenever the writers - starting
          from different points, and following their several
          aims - have entered within that circle ; the briefest
          or most incidental allusion, in biographies or histories,
          to the central verities, tallying perfectly
          with their full development in any of the doctrinal
          portions of Scripture. Moral and religious truth,
          instead of being presented in the 66 sacred
          tracts in a carefully articulated body, has not only
          its members scattered over the whole field of
          Scripture, but they are also exhibited in all the
          different stages of development, in the Mosaic
          embryo as well as in the Christian maturity and
          energy ; yet they easily adjust themselves into a
          harmonious scheme. The constituents of Christianity,
          and their relation to God and man, had
          been expressly indicated by prophecy, and by a
          complete system of prefiguration expanding over
          and around Hebrew saints like a starry night.
          According to the view of the Bible, the past and
          the present is <hi rend="italic">time on the two sides of Christ;</hi> the
          Jewish dispensation looking forward to his <q>day,</q>
          and its dial having gone backward ever since. All
          the particulars of the Hebrew revelation were consonant
          with, but preliminary and subordinate to,
          the Gospel.</p>
                <p>The newer view held by many as resulting from
          critical investigation will be set forth in the
          course of the article. We are not, however, to be
          understood as advocating this view ; we merely
          wish to make our readers aware that such a view
          has commended itself to a large number of learned
          and serious men, whose lives have been spent in
          the study of oriental literature. Modern scholarship
          has come to the task of investigating the
          history of the Scriptures, equipped with acquirements
          that till of late were unattainable. Accurate
          and copious acquaintance with the Phoenician,
          Ethiopic, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic languages,
          and with the literature of these tongues, has
          thrown new lights on the Hebrew language and
          literary forms. The largely extended resources of
          Greek scholarship have been brought to bear on
          the interpretation and study of the New Testament.
          The laws of critical method, as developed
          and applied with success to the profane literature,
          have been applied to our sacred books with a
          freedom formerly unknown. And the new study
          of Biblical theology has made it possible to understand
          in a new fashion the agreements and differences
          of the Old and New Testaments, and of
          the various books of each, one with another. Accordingly,
          discoveries have been made in regard
          to the composition and character of the Hebrew
          documents that were unknown to former ages.
          Many have, in consequence, thought themselves
          compelled to modify their original beliefs concerning
          the nature and extent of the inspiration
          claimed for the writers of the Old Testament ; but
          while seeking to separate what is human and
          changeable from what is divine and everlasting,
          they may and do firmly believe that there is in
          the Old Testament as well as the New a revelation
          from God, divine in origin and absolutely
          authoritative in character, a revelation of God's
          will that can never perish, and must continue to
          strengthen and establish faith in God as long as
          the world endures.</p>

                <p>The word BIBLE is derived from the Greek
          <hi rend="italic">biblia</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">libelli</hi>), <q>little books,</q> and was first
          applied by Chrysostom in the 4th century to that
          collection of sacred writings recognised generally
          by Christians as the documents of a divinely<pb n="49"/>revealed religion. His words are :<cit>
                        <quote>'Provide yourselves with <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi>, the medicine of the soul;
          but if you desire no other, at least procure the
          <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, the Epistles, the Acts, and the Gospels.'</quote>
                    </cit>
          Both as regards language and contents, they are divided
          into two parts - the Old and the New Testament, or
          rather the Old and New Covenant ; for the word
          <hi rend="italic">testamentum</hi> is only a translation into the later
          Latinity of the 2d century of the Greek <hi rend="italic">diatheke</hi>,
          <q>covenant.</q> The history of the Old Testament is
          connected with that of the New by a series of
          writings not received by Protestants as canonical,
          and collectively styled the Apocrypha, which we
          shall consider separately.</p>
                <p>The Old Testament is a collection of 39 books,
          written mainly in Hebrew, but also partly in
          Chaldee, and containing all the remains of
          Hebrew-Chaldaic literature down to at least the
          3d century B.C. By an artificial arrangement
          under the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the
          number of books has been limited to 22. These
          writings were spoken of in the time of Christ as
          <q>Scripture</q>, <q>Holy Scripture</q>, or more specifically
          with regard to their principal contents, as <q>the
          Law and the Prophets</q>. Sometimes the Psalms
          and the remaining holy writings (<hi rend="italic">Hagiographa</hi>)
          are distinctively noticed. The <hi rend="italic">usus loquendi</hi> of
          the New Testament (Matt xi. 13 ; xxii. 40 ; Acts
          xiii. 15; Luke xxiv. 44, &amp;c.) is evidence of this.
          The Law comprised the Pentateuch, or the first
          five books. The Prophets were subdivided into
          earlier and later : the former including the books
          of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings ; and the
          latter containing the three great prophets, Isaiah,
          Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, to whom the Christians,
          in accordance with the Alexandrine translation,
          add Daniel and the <q>minor</q> prophets. The
          third division of the Old Testament embraced the
          Hagiographa, consisting of the books of Job, Proverbs,
          Psalms, the Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes,
          Ruth, Lamentations, and Esther ; together with
          the books of Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and
          2 Chronicles. With regard to the order of these
          several books, the Septuagint, the Fathers of the
          Church, and Luther on one side differ from the
          Jews ; again, among the Jews, the Talmudists
          differ from the Masoretes ; while a difference is
          also found between the Spanish and German
          manuscripts. Hence have sprung the different
          arrangements of the books of the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>Questions concerning the correct classification
          of the divine oracles have become subsidiary, if
          not insignificant, in the presence of that criticism
          which for more than a century has been incessantly
          assailing the ancient theory of their origin.
          Our limits hinder us from doing more than presenting
          a general sketch of its results. First of
          all, we may state the tradition of the Jews themselves
          regarding their canon : they affirmed that
          the various books of the Old Testament were
          <hi rend="italic">originally</hi> written wholly or chiefly by the persons
          whose names are affixed to them, except <hi rend="italic">Judges</hi>
          and <hi rend="italic">Ruth</hi>, which were executed by Samuel;
          <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi>, which was the composition of Mordecai
          <hi rend="italic">Kings</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi>, done by Ezra and Jeremiah
          ; and <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>, which was probably the work of Moses ;
          but that these original manuscripts
          having perished in the destruction of the first
          temple, when Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem,
          the members of the great synagogue - which
          included Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah,
          Malachi, and afterwards, Simon the Just - fifty
          years after the building of the second temple,
          acting in accordance with a divine commission,
          re-wrote the Old Testament, or, rather, made a
          recension of other existing copies, to which were
          subsequently added the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
          Thus the canon was completed. There
          might be slight variations on points of detail, but
          this was in the main the <q>fixed belief</q> of the Jews
          for at least three centuries before Christ. It
          passed over with many other Jewish notions into
          the Christian Church, but was there handled with
          greater freedom by the early Fathers, whose
          various origin, culture, and prepossessions naturally
          led to wide diversities of opinion. But when
          the Graeco-Roman civilisation with its educated
          intelligence passed away, the Jewish belief regarding
          the Old Testament, which was probably that
          of Paul and the other apostles, and which had
          always been the popular and orthodox belief
          in the church, obtained absolute ascendency.
          Though here and there, between the fall of the
          Roman Empire and the dawn of the Reformation,
          faint murmurs of doubt arose, they are scarcely
          audible in the silence of catholic assent.</p>
                <p>It is hardly necessary to notice the partial and
          fragmentary suspicions regarding the canon of
          the Old Testament that accompanied the rise of
          Protestantism, as they did not rest on a scientific
          basis. Luther's contempt for the book of
          Esther, which he declared, on account of its
          <q>heathenish extravagance</q>, to be <q>more worthy
          than all of being excluded from the canon</q>, is
          perhaps as justifiable as the fond admiration of
          the Jewish commentators, who ranked it next to
          the Pentateuch, and explained the absence of all
          recognition of God by the hypothesis, that it was
          originally a part of the Persian chronicles executed
          by Mordecai, who omitted the sacred name
          because it was designed for the heathen ; but
          neither opinion deserves serious consideration, for
          the reasons assigned.</p>
                <p>The new criticism turns, not on the discussion
          of the canonicity of any book or its claims to inspiration,
          but on questions of composition, authorship,
          and date. These questions have for the most
          part never been matters of faith ; current views
          as to the authorship of many of the books of the
          Bible rest solely on ancient tradition, which, till
          recent times, neither had been examined nor could
          have been. The solution of these problems, though
          having a very manifest bearing on theology, is
          itself purely a matter of scholarship ; the question
          as to inspiration is necessarily for theology to
          discuss, and is posterior to those concerning the
          time at which a book was written, and the
          materials from which it was drawn. The modern
          movement centred long in the question as to
          the author of the Pentateuch. Hobbes, the
          Malmesbury philosopher, pointed out in 1653
          the difficulties in the way of assuming Moses to
          be the author, and emphasised the citations in
          the Pentateuch <q>from another more ancient book
          entitled the Book of the Wars of the Lord.</q>
                    <bibl>

                        </title>
                    </bibl> discusses
          the Hebrew canon with new freedom. Père
          Simon and Clericus both brought accurate learning
          to bear on the investigation. And an epoch
          in Biblical criticism is marked by the ingenious
          hypothesis of Astruc, a Belgian physician, that
          the use of the names Elohim and Jehovah in<pb n="50"/>Genesis, gives a clue to the two distinct documents
          of which the first book of Moses is composed.
          Since his time, a controversy has raged,
          of which the end is still far off. Germany was
          long the great battle-field of the combatants ; but
          the war has now extended to England, Holland,
          and America.</p>
                <p>As regards the Pentateuch, hardly any unprejudiced
          scholar would now maintain the ancient
          belief that it is, as a whole, the composition of
          Moses, or, in the form in which it exists, that it
          is the work of a contemporary of the Hebrew
          legislator. Opinion, indeed, differs on the question
          of the extent to which the writer or compiler of
          the book availed himself of materials that Moses
          or others may have collected, and many think
          that the minutiae of the sacerdotal law were
          probably an expansion and development of the
          simpler ritual of the wilderness. That it must have
          been at least redacted since the time of Moses,
          is shewn by numerous passages which indicate a
          later date than the conquest of Palestine - <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                    <q>And the Canaanite was then in the land</q> (Gen. xii. 6) ;
          <q>And the Canaanite and the Perizzite
          dwelled then in the land</q> (Gen. xiii. 7) ;
          <q>And these
          are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
          <hi rend="italic">before there reigned any king over the children
          of Israel</hi>
                    </q> (Gen. xxxvi. 31); <q>That the land spue
          not you out also, when ye defile it, <hi rend="italic">as it spued out
          the nations that were before you</hi>
                    </q> (Lev. xviii. 28).
          The evidence of the post-Mosaic origin of <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
          parts of the Pentateuch may thus be said to lie
          on the surface, and is perceptible even by the
          unlearned reader; but a knowledge of the Hebrew
          tongue is necessary to appreciate the value of
          that criticism which has found in the book traces
          of various documents. Some scholars assume
          four ; two are almost universally admitted, and
          are generally spoken of as the Elohistic and
          Jehovistic documents, from the names of the
          Deity which are constantly used in certain sections
          of Genesis. The former is believed to be
          the older document, and it always occurs in connection
          with certain distinctive peculiarities of
          thought and expression that mark an independent
          author. The two are not strictly coincident. Thus,
          for example, in the beginning of Genesis, we find
          what appear to be two different accounts of the
          history of the creation : in the one, God is always
          Elohim ; in the other, Jehovah. The same is to
          be said with regard to the account of the Deluge,
          and several incidents in the lives of the Patriarchs
          ; the descriptions of the tabernacle ; the
          priestly vestments ; the story of the manna as
          given in Exodus and Numbers ; the account of
          the appointment of the council of the seventy
          elders in the same books ; &amp;c. The Elohist's narration
          of the primitive patriarchal history is short,
          simple, and free from poetical rhetoric. The
          Jehovist's account is more elaborate, and dwells
          at greater length on the leading heroes and
          principal events. The Jehovist is penetrated with
          the later theocratic spirit, and the theology of
          the prophets. He treats the national history and
          laws from a didactic point of view. Moreover,
          the Elohist generally speaks of the Divine Being
          as the national God of Israel, the other nations
          and their affairs being of no account. To the
          Jehovist, on the other hand, Jehovah is the God
          of the whole earth (Gen. xxiv. 3) ; all nations are
          to be blessed in the seed of Abraham (Gen. xxii.
          18) : Israel is to be a <q>kingdom of priests</q> (Exod.
          xix. 6) to bring the Gentiles to God. The view
          now in most favour with critics is that there
          were <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Elohists, one prior, the other posterior
          to the Jehovist.</p>
                <p>The documents being thus considered not to
          have proceeded from Moses alone, or from any
          one person or age, have, in consequence, become
          exposed to all kinds of critical analysis, and their
          historic, scientific, and moral statements have been
          repeatedly challenged. Comparative theology, for
          example, throws some doubts on the exclusively
          Hebrew origin of the story of Paradise. It is
          supposed to be Aryan as well as Semitic ; or
          perhaps it goes back to that remote past when
          the distinctions between the two families of mankind
          were less sharply defined than they afterwards
          became. The controversy regarding the
          account of creation is more familiar to ordinary
          readers, but arose from a misconception as to the
          nature and design of the account. Whether or
          not the results of modern criticism regarding the
          origin of the book are received, nobody should
          seek for scientific notions in a cosmogony belonging
          to the first ages of the world. The story of
          the antediluvians, of the Deluge, of the Tower of
          Babel, and other wonders recorded in Genesis,
          are found to present numerous points of similarity
          to the Indian, Persian, or Chaldsean versions of
          the same stories, together with such variations as
          mark a distinct national tradition. The received
          chronology, as ordinarily understood, is also questioned.
          Six thousand years for the history of the
          world, is now almost universally felt to be inadequate
          to account for the diversities that exist
          among mankind, assuming the Biblical doctrine
          of the unity of the race to be true ; and in addition,
          proof is held to have been dug up from the
          bowels of the earth that man has been in existence
          here for a much longer period. The narrative
          of the exodus of the children of Israel from
          Egypt has been subjected to a microscopic criticism
          by Bishop Colenso, who has set forth what
          he regards as the most serious difficulties of the
          account It is argued that the later developments
          of sacerdotal legislation have been thrown
          back to the Mosaic period, for the purpose of
          investing them with greater sanctity and authority.
          This would not indeed be done deliberately or all
          at once, but by degrees ; and as each particular
          ordinance was shaped in obedience to the religious
          precepts of the great deliverer, it would come
          to be considered as springing from him who was
          the origin and soul of the nation.</p>
                <p>The preceding sketch of the mode in which
          criticism has dealt with the Pentateuch, will be
          sufficient to shew the reader the scope and method
          of modern critical inquiry, and it will, therefore,
          not be necessary to exhibit the line of analysis
          pursued in regard to the other books. Briefly,
          the results are these: <hi rend="italic">The Book of Joshua</hi> contains
          passages, such as the allusion to Judah and
          Israel as distinct (xi. 21), which point to an age
          later than that of Solomon, and the grammatical
          forms confirm this view. <hi rend="italic">Judges</hi> has a thoroughly
          antique character, and the documents from which
          the compiler drew are mostly anterior to the
          monarchy ; but there are references which are
          later -
          <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                    <q>There was no king in Israel in those
          days</q> (xvii. 6 ; xviii. 1 ; xix. 1 ; xxi. 25). Its history
          is romantic and picturesque, but little or no<pb n="51"/>mention is made of priests. <hi rend="italic">Ruth</hi> could not have
          been written before the close of David's reign, if
          so early. The genealogy carried down to him
          shews the theocratic significance he had acquired,
          and the expression, <q>Now this was the manner in
          former time</q>, &amp;c. (iv. 7), indicates a considerable
          change in the manners and customs of the people.
          The <hi rend="italic">Books of Samuel</hi> (originally forming one
          work) are compiled from distinct and independent
          sources -
          <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> there are two divergent accounts of
          David's introduction to Saul (xvi. 14-23, compared
          with xvii. 55-58). The repeated mention of Judah
          and Israel points to a period later than the separation
          of the monarchy as the date of the final
          redaction ; but as the language is remarkably
          pure, and quite free from late forms and Chaldaisms,
          the compilation must be much older than
          the Exile. The <hi rend="italic">Books of Kings</hi> also formed
          originally but one work. It belongs to the period ,
          of the Captivity, and was probably executed in
          Babylon. The sources from which the editor or
          author drew are various, and of different dates.
          Some are as old as the time of Solomon ; others,
          such as the histories of Elijah and Elisha, must
          be among the latest. The spirit of the work is
          <hi rend="italic">theocratico-prophetic</hi> in a high degree. The compiler
          of <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> goes over much the same
          ground, and refers in the same way to the sources
          from which he drew, but he is not so genuinely
          historical, and the Levitical tendency is strong.
          The work is essentially <hi rend="italic">ecclesiastical</hi>; <q>the priests
          are everywhere in the foreground, the prophets
          in the distance.</q> The history is brought down
          to the close of the Exile, but the genealogical
          register (1 Chron. iii. 19-24) carries us on to
          the 4th or 3d century B.C. ; and the orthography,
          style, and language are very late, and
          very impure. <hi rend="italic">Ezra</hi> is mainly the composition
          of the Chronist, and <hi rend="italic">Nehemiah</hi> partly the work
          of Nehemiah himself, and partly of the Chronist.
          <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> belongs to the times of the Seleucidae and
          Ptolemies, and is marked by the absence both of
          a religious and a theocratic spirit. The work
          is even held by some to be a translation from
          the Persian. The Jews are spoken of in the third
          person. Mordecai is <q>Mordecai, the Jew</q> (ii. 5).
          God is not once mentioned. <hi rend="italic">Job</hi> is a great
          dramatic poem with elaborate rhythmical forms.
          The prologue, epilogue, and the passage containing
          the speeches of Elihu (xxxii.-xxxvii,), are
          held by many to be by a different hand from the
          body of the main poem. Even that cannot be
          earlier than the time of Solomon, on account of
          the reference to the gold of Ophir (xxii. 24), and
          few critics consider it older than the 7th or 8th
          century B.C. Indeed, the whole language is so
          highly artificial, as well as artistic, that it could
          only have been composed in a cultivated age of
          Hebrew history. The author was a Hebrew
          of large and catholic spirit, on whom the mystery
          of existence and the evils of life pressed heavily,
          but who was sustained by a noble faith in the
          righteousness of God. The characters are considered
          mostly imaginative creations, but the
          central figure, Job himself, may be a historic
          personage, ideally treated, like the Hamlet of
          Shakspeare. The collection of pious lyrics known
          as the <hi rend="italic">Psalms</hi> was probably made shortly after
          the return from the Captivity. They are of various
          ages, from the time of Moses down to
          Nehemiah, and contain the quintessence of the
          national religion and ethics. The language bears
          distinct traces of the different periods, and of
          the different characters and dispositions of the
          authors. Every emotion finds expression, from
          the pure, deep, tender trust in God, manifested by
          the hunted outlaw of the wilderness (Ps. xxiii.), to
          the vengeful passion of the outraged exile who
          exulted in the hope that the brains of Babylonian
          infants would yet be dashed against the stones
          (Ps. cxxxvii.). <hi rend="italic">Proverbs</hi> is also a collection - <q>an
          anthology of gnomes and sentences, the fruit of
          reflections on the Mosaic law, and on the divine
          guidance of the Israelites.</q> Internal evidence is
          unfavourable to the theory of its Solomonian
          authorship. Diction and style differ in different
          parts. Some of the sayings are likely enough
          those of the royal sage, but parts of the work are
          not older than the 6th century B.C. <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastes</hi>
          could not have been written by Solomon, or he
          would not have said, <q>I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> king over Israel in
          Jerusalem</q> (i. 12) ; the social condition of the
          country as described in the work does not suit the
          reign of that monarch ; the language is postexilian.
          It most resembles that of Esther and
          Daniel, and is probably a composition of the 4th
          century B.C., when Judea presented a gloomy
          aspect, and men were becoming sceptical in spite
          of their religion. The work is not hopeful, but
          contains many fine passages breathing a spirit
          of pious resignation. The <hi rend="italic">Song of Solomon</hi> is
          not the work of the king himself, but is held to
          belong to the next age. Its mystic or allegoric
          character is a Jewish theory to explain or apologise
          for its reception into the canon. Its application
          to the spiritual relation between Christ and
          the Church seems to most modern interpreters to
          be far fetched.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">prophetical</hi> writings constitute a special
          department of Hebrew literature, the interpretation
          of which is one of the most delicate and
          difficult operations of criticism. The once universal
          belief was that their authors were not only
          infallibly guided by God, but inspired, word by
          word, to address their countrymen in regard to
          things present and to come ; so that when the
          phrase occurs, <q>Thus <hi rend="italic">saith</hi> the Lord</q>, or, <q>The
          <hi rend="Italic">word</hi> of the Lord came unto me</q>, it was to be understood
          that the Lord actually used, or constrained
          the prophet to use, the language which follows.
          Many Biblical scholars, on the other hand, content
          themselves with the view that the prophets were
          men who were intensely and even passionately
          sincere, and to whom distrust of the Eternal, or
          worldliness, or disloyalty to the national faith, or
          any other form of hollowness, was supremely
          hateful. They accordingly do not search for
          precise dogmas and circumstantial facts in those
          thoughts that breathe, and words that burn ; they
          neither demand minute accuracy from fiery orators,
          nor hazard the character of the writers on
          the fulfilment of specific predictions. Above
          all, the newer view of prophecy, common to
          almost all modern expositors, declines to hold - as
          was once universally held - that the most important
          element of prophecy lies in prediction. It is
          admitted that the prophecies, which in their
          written form are probably much abridged, were
          addressed to the prophets' contemporaries, not to
          future ages, and consist for the most part of
          rebukes and warnings against sins then common,
          of exhortations to acknowledged duty, and of<pb n="52"/>encouragement drawn from the certain fulfilment
          of God's gracious promises. This view
          permits those who hold it to look with greater
          equanimity on presumed errors in the prophetical
          authors, or in the traditional interpretations
          of their idealistic imagery ; as also on the still
          more significant discovery, that the alleged
          authorship is sometimes doubtful. Thus, while
          the first thirty-nine chapters of the book of <hi rend="italic">Isaiah</hi>
          are generally supposed to be the work of the contemporary
          of Hezekiah, the remaining chapters
          (xl.-lxvi.) are regarded as the composition of one
          who had seen the miseries of the Exile, and who
          knew the desolations of Judah. Cyrus is mentioned
          by name (xlv. 1), and an intimate knowledge
          is exhibited of his career. The style, both
          in thought and language, of the <q>younger</q> Isaiah
          is entirely unlike that of the older ; even in the
          English version this is apparent. The text of
          <hi rend="italic">Jeremiah</hi> is in a state of great disorder. The
          last chapter is a later appendix, and the final
          editor of the whole work is unknown. The
          <hi rend="italic">Lamentations of Jeremiah</hi> display the same literary
          characteristics as the larger work, and are
          the production of the same mind. <hi rend="italic">Ezekiel</hi> was
          not, even among the Jews, universally supposed
          to be the work of the writer whose name it bears.
          The Talmud says it was the composition of the
          Great Synagogue ; while the internal differences
          are so marked, that modern criticism would bring
          down parts of the prophetic vision to the Persian
          period, and even later. The last nine chapters,
          describing with great minuteness everything concerning
          the temple to be, and the priesthood, the
          division of the Holy Land, the dimensions of the
          Holy City, and the like, are not prophetic in
          tone, but priestly ; they are the details thought
          out by an organising caste who are shaping anew
          the conditions of national life. The book of
          <hi rend="italic">Daniel</hi>, not admitted by the Jews into the prophetical
          series proper, is radically unlike the
          other prophecies. The precise details regarding
          events long after Daniel's time, are singularly
          in contrast with the <q>prophetic perspective</q> of
          earlier prophets. Both the Hebrew and the
          Chaldee are very corrupt ; <hi rend="italic">Greek</hi> words occur -
          <hi rend="italic">e.g. symphonia</hi> (iii. 5), translated <q>dulcimer</q> in the
          authorised version ; there are not a few historical
          difficulties in connection with the statements
          made about Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Darius
          the Mede ; its angelology is post-exilian. The
          work in its present form is perhaps not earlier
          than times of foreign oppression by Antiochus
          Epiphanes, and the Maccabee wars. It is unnecessary to touch upon all the minor prophets
          separately. But <hi rend="Italic">Zechariah</hi> is now very commonly
          assumed to consist of two main parts (i. to viii.
          and ix. to xiv.) of which the latter is by an author
          or authors living at a much later time than the
          earlier prophet, to whose work, in spite of characteristic
          differences, these oracles have been
          appended. The book of <hi rend="italic">Jonah</hi> is often taken to
          resemble Job in containing a poetical invention of
          incidents for didactic purposes, but grouped
          around a venerable historical name.</p>
                <p>It is sufficiently manifest that very many of the
          conclusions above recorded cannot be supported
          by demonstrative evidence. Like all arguments
          of the kind, they rest on probability alone. To
          complete the sketch, it may be well to give a
          summary view of the newer conceptions as to
          the development of the Hebrew canonical literature.</p>
                <p>The first beginnings of the existing collection of
          Old Testament Scriptures are to be sought for in
          the time of Moses and the age immediately after
          him. In Solomon's time (the 10th century B.C),
          the first four books of Moses and the connected
          book of Joshua were compiled from three or more
          sources : to the time of the later kings are to be
          traced the books of Judges and Samuel. In the
          8th century B.C., the earlier oracles of the prophets
          were written down; in Josiah's time the Pentateuch
          was completed ; and the books of Kings,
          compiled from more ancient materials, date from
          the Babylonian exile. So that by this time the
          first canon of the Jews, the Torah, was complete ;
          together with the first part of the second canon,
          the <q>prior prophets</q>. The second part, comprising
          the <q>posterior prophets</q> or prophets proper,
          was begun after the Exile, and finished probably
          before 200 B.C. Last of all comes the third
          canon, or Hagiographa. It includes Chronicles,
          dating from about 200 B.C. ; Daniel, from near
          the middle of the 2d century; Psalms, ancient
          and modern; and the Proverbs and Job, both
          probably of the 8th century B.C. All the three
          divisions of the Old Testament are spoken of in
          the book of Sirach (130 B.C.) ; and though doubts
          as to the standing of Ecclesiastes and Esther
          continued to crop up, the Old Testament canon,
          as we have it, seems to have been completely
          established in the time of Josephus.</p>

            <div>
                <head>VERSIONS.</head>
                <p>We now proceed to notice those versions of
          the Old Testament in whole or part that are still
          extant. First comes the <hi rend="italic">Samaritan Pentateuch</hi>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>The Samaritan Pentateuch.</head>
                <p>We are told (2 Kings xvii. 2, 24) that after
          the king of Assyria had carried away the tea
          tribes of Israel into captivity (737 B.C.), he sent
          some of his own subjects as colonists into the
          desolate country, where none but the aged and
          poor of the Israelites had been left. The Assyrians
          and the Israelites, it is usually said, soon became
          a mixed people, henceforth known as <hi rend="italic">Samaritans</hi>.
          There is no actual evidence of this coalescence,
          and it is not asserted in Scripture, but it is
          intrinsically probable, and is therefore generally
          assumed by all shades of Biblical critics. The
          origin and age of the Pentateuch possessed by
          this mixed race is still matter of dispute. Some
          are of opinion that it came into their hands as a
          natural inheritance from the Jewish people, whom
          they succeeded at the time of the Babylonish
          exile. Josephus <hi rend="italic">Ant</hi>. xi. 8, ss. 2, 4) states that it
          was brought to them by Manasse, when the
          Samaritan sanctuary on Mount Gerizim was
          founded ; others suppose that the Israelitish
          priest sent by the king of Assyria (2 Kings, xvii.
          27, 28) to instruct the new settlers in the religion
          of the country, brought it with him. It has
          even been conjectured that it is a late and faulty
          recension of the Hebrew text, into which glosses
          from the Septuagint have been introduced ; and
          in confirmation of this view, it is pointed out that
          the anthropomorphisms and anthropopathisms of
          the original have been carefully expunged.</p>
                <p>There are very few references to the work in
          early times. If we except some vague allusions<pb n="53"/>here and there in the Church Fathers (Origen,
          Jerome, Eusebius), and one or two more distinct
          but less generally known Talmudical utterances
          respecting it, no information was possessed about
          it till the year 1616, when Pietro della Valle
          acquired a complete codex from the Samaritans
          in Damascus. Since then, the number of manuscripts
          with and without translations (in Arabic)
          has considerably increased in European libraries.</p>
                <p>The manuscripts are written in the Samaritan
          character, a kind of ancient Hebrew writing,
          probably in use before and partly after the Babylonish
          exile, and vary in size from octavo to
          folio. None of the manuscripts that have
          reached Europe is older than the 10th century.
          The <hi rend="italic">Samaritan Pentateuch</hi> was first edited
          by J. Morinus in the Paris <hi rend="italic">Polyglott</hi> (1632)
          from <hi rend="italic">one</hi> codex, and was re-edited by Blayney in
          the square Hebrew characters, at Oxford (1790).
          The first publication of this strange document
          marks a certain epoch in modern Biblical investigation
          ; for incredible as it now appears, it was
          placed by Morinus and his followers far above the
          received Hebrew text, which was said to have been
          corrupted from it. As reasons for this, its superior
          <q>lucidity and harmony</q> were adduced, and
          its agreement with the Septuagint in many places.
          This opinion was zealously cherished and fiercely
          combated for two centuries, when the first proper
          and scientific investigation (by Gesenius) set it at
          rest, once for all, among the learned world at
          least. The boasted superiority <hi rend="italic">en bloc</hi>, gradually
          dwindled down to two or three passages in which
          the Samaritan reading seemed preferable, and
          even these have now been disposed of in favour
          of the authorised Masoretic text. A chronological
          peculiarity deserves special mention - namely, that
          in the Samaritan Pentateuch, no one in the antediluvian
          times begets his first son after the age of
          a hundred and fifty, either the father's or the
          son's age being altered in proportion ; after the
          Deluge, however, the opposite method is followed
          of adding fifty or a hundred years to the father's
          years before the begetting of a son.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>The Septuagint.</head>
                <p>The most ancient Greek version of the Old
          Testament that has come down to us, and the
          one that was commonly in use among the Jews
          at the time of Christ, is named the <hi rend="italic">Septuagint</hi>.
          Its origin is shrouded in deep obscurity. But the
          myth concerning it is well known, and was received
          by the church as a piece of genuine history
          down to the 17th century. It is contained in
          a letter purporting to be written by a Greek,
          Aristeas, to his brother, Philocrates, during the
          reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt
          (284-247 B.C.), and is to the following effect:
          Demetrius Phalereus, librarian to Ptolemy, while
          engaged in drawing up a general collection of
          laws, ascertained that those of the Jews were peculiarly
          interesting, and expressed to his sovereign
          a wish to have a copy of them. Ptolemy immediately
          took steps to procure one. First of all,
          he set free more than 100,000 Jewish captives,
          whom his father had carried into Egypt, though
          their ransom cost him a sum estimated at nearly
          <hi rend="italic">three millions sterling</hi>. Then he wrote a letter
          to Eleazar, the high-priest, praying him to send
          a copy of the Jewish Scriptures, together with
          <hi rend="italic">seventy-two</hi> learned men (hence the Latin name
          <hi rend="italic">Septuaginta</hi> = 70, six from each of the twelve
          tribes, who could translate Hebrew into Greek.
          This letter, along with magnificent presents, was
          conveyed to Jerusalem by two ambassadors,
          Andreas and Aristeas. A favourable reception
          was given to the embassy by Eleazar, who delivered
          up a copy of the Scriptures in letters of
          gold, and selected for the work of translation
          seventy-two of the wisest and most erudite men
          in all Palestine. On their arrival in Alexandria,
          they were entertained for seven successive days
          at splendid feasts, the king himself entering into
          free conversation with his guests, and propounding
          many abstruse questions for their solution.
          Their answers inspired everybody with admiration
          of their sagacity. At the close of the festivities,
          they were conducted by Demetrius, for the sake
          of quiet, to the isle of Pharos, which was conveniently
          near. There they worked hard for the
          greater part of the day, returning to Alexandria
          in the evening ; and at length, in exactly as many
          days as there were translators, namely, seventy-two,
          the version was finished. It was then read
          by Demetrius, in the presence of the principal
          Jews residing in Alexandria, who praised its
          fidelity, and imprecated curses on the heads
          of any who should dare to alter a word. Then
          the king, after publicly expressing his admiration
          of the wisdom of Moses, ordered the work to be
          religiously preserved in the Alexandrian Library,
          and loading the translators with gifts, permitted
          them to return to Jerusalem. He also granted to
          the Alexandrian Jews the privilege of transcribing
          the work for their own use.</p>
                <p>This is the substance of Aristeas's letter, which
          is still extant, and no one who has paid any attention
          to the peculiar traits of <hi rend="italic">fabricated</hi> narratives,
          can doubt for a moment that we have here a
          choice specimen of the class. The author professes
          to be a heathen, while his letter is in reality
          steeped in Jewish prejudices. The attitude of
          Ptolemy towards the Jews is a patriotic figment;
          his liberation of the captives and his gorgeous
          presents to the Temple are things unknown to
          history ; his desire for an equal number of translators
          from each of the twelve tribes is a ludicrous
          homage to a vanished tribal system : the convivial
          entertainments in Alexandria are merely
          vulgar attempts to glorify the translators. Every
          scholar, indeed, now admits that the letter is a
          forgery, executed for the purpose of exalting the
          credit of the version, which, in reality, was made
          by different men at different times, and which,
          instead of being remarkable for its uniform excellence,
          displays all the various degrees of merit,
          from a painful literality, to the most arbitrary
          license. Yet, on the other hand, the forgery is
          itself ancient, and therefore some grains of historic
          fact may perhaps lie hidden in the bushel of
          falsehood, though we are now incapable of making
          them out. Philo, who was a contemporary of
          Christ, repeats the story in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Moses</hi>
          with some variations. He says nothing about
          Demetrius Phalereus or Aristeas, but he mentions
          the deputation to Jerusalem, and the execution
          of the work in the isle of Pharos. He also
          represents the translators (whose number he does
          not specify) as producing each a separate version,
          and adds, that when all were compared, they were
          found to agree so exactly that it proved the translators
          to be inspired. But Philo was himself igno-<pb n="54"/>rant of Hebrew, and therefore likely to believe
          any wondrous tale about the merits of the Septuagint.
          Josephus, a little later, is familiar with
          the letter of Aristeas, which he substantially reproduces
          in his <hi rend="italic">Antiquities</hi>. Much earlier, however,
          than either of these is the evidence of Aristobulus,
          who flourished in the beginning of the 2d century
          B.C. Unfortunately, this evidence is not
          beyond dispute. It is only preserved at secondhand
          in Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius, and
          at best is rather obscure. The chief point of
          difference in the statement of Aristobulus from
          that of the pseudo-Aristeas is, that he assigns the
          translation to the reign of Ptolemy <q>Soter</q>, father
          of <q>Philadelphus</q>. There is also a passage in the
          prologue to the apocryphal book called <hi rend="italic">Jesus,
          the Son of Sirach</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiasticus</hi>, which seems
          to imply that a Greek version of the Old Testament
          then (2d century B.C.) existed. But it gives
          no support to the Aristean myth. The later
          testimony of the Church Fathers, Epiphanius,
          Eusebius, Jerome, &amp;c. is entirely without weight.
          It is merely Aristeas over again, with such
          modifications as they chose to make in the
          original narrative.</p>
                <p>What, then, was probably the origin of the
          Septuagint? First of all, it should be noted that
          Aristeas, Aristobulus, Philo, Josephus, and the
          Talmudists - the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> authorities - speak only of
          the translation of the Law - <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the Pentateuch -
          while the Church Fathers, who are no authorities
          at all, mention the entire Old Testament. It may
          be allowed, on the authority of Aristobulus, that, in
          the reign of one of the Ptolemies, a version of the
          Pentateuch was made for the benefit of the large
          Jewish community resident in Alexandria, to
          whom Hebrew had become unknown or unfamiliar.
          That the translators, however, were not Palestinian
          but Egyptian Jews, appears equally clear, both
          from the state of the text from which the translation
          must have been made, and from the intimate
          acquaintance with Egyptian manners and customs
          which it evinces. This text differs considerably
          from our received text, but agrees in many instances
          with the Samaritan. We have seen that
          no value whatever can be attached to the number
          <q>seventy-two</q>, which is found in the Aristean
          figment ; but a close examination of the Greek
          has led to the conclusion, that several hands were
          employed on the version of the Pentateuch. It is
          not necessary to discuss the probable dates of the
          translation of the remaining books of the Old
          Testament : for the most part, there are no external
          data to go upon ; and even the internal are
          slight, and only appreciable by scholars. But it
          is generally assumed that the passage (previously
          referred to) from the prologue to <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiasticus</hi>
          proves the whole to have been completed before
          130 B.C. In some instances, it would appear as
          if the translation had been made before the non-pentateuchal
          books were united with the others
          into one canon. This seems particularly evident
          in the case of the book of Jeremiah, which, in the
          translation, appears in a more primitive form
          than in the state in which we possess it now. In
          a less degree, the same discrepancy appears in
          Job, the Proverbs, Daniel, and Esther ; of these,
          however, our canon probably contains the original
          form, while the Septuagint shews later variants.
          Among the most successful versions are those of
          parts of the Pentateuch, especially Leviticus and
          Deuteronomy, Proverbs, and Ezekiel. But, on
          the whole, there is noticeable throughout the
          Septuagint a want of mastery over both Hebrew
          and Greek, a striving after minute fidelity in one
          part, and an unbridled arbitrariness in another ;
          everywhere we see tropical expressions freely
          changed, anthropomorphic ideas toned down or
          left out altogether, and words that were objectionable
          to the refined taste of Alexandria quietly
          ignored.</p>
                <p>The Septuagint was held in the very highest
          repute among the Alexandrine Jews, while the
          Palestinians looked upon it as a dangerous innovation,
          and even kept the day of its completion as
          a day of mourning. Gradually, however, it also
          found its way into Palestine, and at the time of
          the composition of the New Testament, it seems
          almost to have superseded the original - at least,
          the writers quote almost invariably from it : out
          of a sum-total of 225 quotations, 190 are expressly
          taken from the Septuagint. Christ himself frequently
          uses it even where it departs considerably
          from the Hebrew. For some centuries after
          his time, it was read and interpreted in the synagogues,
          until the increasing knowledge of the
          original, fostered by the numerous Jewish academies
          and schools (Hebrew, like Latin, being first
          thoroughly studied after it had become a <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>
          language), and by the frequent disputations with
          the early Christians, brought more faithful and
          literal translations into use, such as those of
          Aquila (2d century A.D.), a Jewish proselyte of
          Sinope, in Asia Minor, and Theodotion (2d century
          A.D.), an Ebionite Christian ; and gradually
          the Septuagint was wholly discarded in the synagogue.
          The Christian Church, however, long
          considered it equal in authority and inspiration
          to the Hebrew text itself, and such is the opinion
          of the Greek Church even at the present day.
          Though itself only a translation, it gave birth to
          a numerous family. The Itala, the Syriac, the
          Ethiopic, the Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Slavonian,
          &amp;c. owe their origin to this far-famed version.
          The wide diffusion of the Septuagint among
          both the Hellenistic Jews and the churches, the
          absence of anything like a fixed text, the pious
          desire to insert peculiar explanations of obscure
          passages, the ignorance of copyists, and many
          other causes, combined to render the manuscripts
          not a little corrupt, and in some cases past mending.
          Nor were the endeavours of Origen, in his
          <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi> or <hi rend="italic">six</hi>-fold edition of the Old Testament,
          permanently successful in restoring a proper text.
          His noble labour of thirty years is almost entirely
          lost. Only fragments have come down to us,
          the original having perished when Caesarea was
          sacked by the Arabs in the 7th century.</p>

            <div>
                <head>The Old Syriac Version.</head>
                <p>There is another version of the Scriptures
          which ranks with the Samaritan Pentateuch and
          the Septuagint, though less ancient than either -
          the old Syriac translation, called the <hi rend="italic">Peshito</hi>, a
          word which is commonly, but erroneously, rendered
          by <q>simple</q> or <q>faithful</q>, while it properly
          means the <q>explained</q> or <q>translated</q>. Among
          the Syrian churches it is held in the greatest veneration,
          being to them what the <hi rend="italic">Vulgate</hi> is to the
          Roman, or the <hi rend="italic">Authorised Version</hi> to the English
          churches. There are numerous traditions regarding
          its origin. Thus, the translation of the Old<pb n="55"/>Testament is supposed to date from the time of
          Solomon and Hiram ; or to have been done by
          Asa, the priest ; or, again, that it belongs to the
          time of the apostle Thaddaeus (Adaeus), and
          Abgar, the king of Osroene, in the 1st century.
          To the same period is also supposed to belong
          the translation of the New Testament which is
          ascribed to Achaeus, a disciple of Thaddeus, the
          first Edessian bishop and martyr. Recent investigation
          has not as yet come to any nearer result
          than to place the latter vaguely in the 2d, and the
          former in the 3d century, and to make Judaic
          Christians the authors of both. Ephraem Syrus,
          who wrote in the 4th century, certainly speaks of
          the Peshito as <q>
                        <hi rend="italic">our</hi> version</q>, and finds it already
          necessary to explain some of its terms, which had
          become obsolete. The version of the Old Testament
          was made direct from the Hebrew, and by
          men imbued with the Palestinian mode of explanation.
          It is extremely faithful, and astonishingly
          free from any of those paraphrastic tendencies
          which pervade more or less all the Targums or
          Aramaic versions. Its renderings are mostly very
          happy, and coincide in many places with those of
          the Septuagint, a circumstance that has given rise
          to the erroneous supposition that the latter itself
          had been drawn upon.</p>

            <div>
                <head>THE APOCRYPHA.</head>
                <p>This is perhaps the proper place to notice the
          apocryphal literature of both Testaments. No one
          can fail to be struck with the contrast which the
          Old Testament Apocrypha presents in tone and
          character to the canonical writings, <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> alone
          excepted. The very best portions of it, such as
          <hi rend="italic">The Wisdom of Jesus, Son of Sirach</hi>, are destitute
          of that living authoritative power of religious
          conviction which belongs to men who have stood,
          as it were, face to face with God, and to whom the
          things that are unseen and eternal are more real
          than the things that are seen and temporal. The
          term apocryphal originally meant <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> or <hi rend="italic">concealed</hi>,
          and was rendered current by the Jews of
          Alexandria. In the earliest churches, it was
          applied with very different significations to a
          variety of writings. Sometimes it was given to
          those whose authorship and original form were
          unknown ; sometimes to writings containing a
          hidden meaning ; sometimes to those whose public
          use was not thought advisable. In this last signification,
          it has been customary, since the time
          of Jerome, to apply the term to a number of
          writings which the Septuagint had circulated
          amongst the Christians, and which were sometimes
          considered as an appendage to the Old
          Testament, and sometimes as a portion of it.
          The Greek Church, at the Council of Laodicea
          (360 A.D.), excluded them from the canon ; the
          Latin Church, on the other hand, always highly
          favoured them ; and, finally, the Council of Trent
          (1545-63) placed them on an equality with the
          rest of the Old Testament. The Church of England
          uses them in part for edification, but not
          for the <q>establishment of doctrine</q>. All other
          Protestant churches in England and America
          reject their use in public worship. But it was
          once customary to bind up the Apocrypha between
          the authorised versions of the Old and New Testaments,
          though this has now ceased, and, as a
          consequence, this curious, interesting, and instructive
          part of Jewish literature is now known only to
          scholars. The Old Testament Apocrypha consists
          of fourteen books : 1. First Esdras ; 2. Second
          Esdras; 3. Tobit ; 4. Judith; 5. The parts of
          Esther not found in Hebrew or Chaldee ; 6. The
          Wisdom of Solomon ; 7. The Wisdom of Jesus,
          Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus ; 8. Baruch ; 9.
          The Song of the Three Holy Children ; 10. The
          History of Susanna; 11. The History of the
          Destruction of Bel and the Dragon ; 12. The
          Prayer of Manasses, King of Judah ; 13. First
          Maccabees ; 14. Second Maccabees. The precise
          origin of all these writings cannot be ascertained.
          Some of them were to all appearance originally
          written in Hebrew - especially Ecclesiasticus and
          the First Book of the Maccabees ; and these
          seem to be contemporary with some of the later
          Psalms. Second Maccabees and Judith belong
          also apparently to the time of the Maccabees ;
          and Tobit and Baruch were also probably first
          written in Hebrew or Chaldee, yet, like the rest of
          the Apocrypha, which were certainly written in
          Greek, all are now extant only in the Greek text.
          None of them was received into the Jewish
          canon ; and though they were all found in the
          Septuagint used by the Christians, it is doubtful
          if some of them were acknowledged even by the
          Greek-speaking Jews. To the books ordinarily
          called Apocrypha may fairly be added the Psalms
          of Solomon, written a short time before Christ ;
          and the Book of Enoch and the so-called Fourth
          Book of Esdras, though not found in the Greek
          Bible, seem partly at least to have been known to
          the writers of the New Testament. Some of the
          Apocrypha bear traces of a Palestinian, others of
          an Egypto-Alexandrine, and others again of a
          Chaldaico-Persian origin or influence. Most, if
          not all, bear internal evidence of having been
          composed in the 1st and 2d centuries B.C.</p>
                <p>The Old Testament Apocrypha supplies us with
          most interesting materials for insight into the
          development of Jewish theology, of religious and
          national faith, during the centuries immediately
          before Christ.</p>
                <p>It is in connection with the New Testament
          Apocrypha that the latter word came to have ultimately
          attached to it the signification of <q>spurious</q>
          or <q>false</q>. The Apocrypha of the New Testament
          may be arranged under three heads : 1. The writings
          comprising the <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal Gospels</hi>, which
          consist of twenty-two separate documents, ten in
          Greek and twelve in Latin. They concern themselves
          with the history of Joseph and of the Virgin
          Mary before the birth of Christ, with the infancy
          of Christ, and with the history of Pilate. The most
          important of the set are the <hi rend="italic">Protevangelium of
          James</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Thomas</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Acts of
          Pilate</hi>, which are perhaps the origines of all the
          apocryphal traditions. That many of the stories
          found in these were current in the 2d century is
          abundantly proved, but we have no evidence that
          any of the books known as Apocryphal Gospels
          were then in existence, or are older than the 4th
          century. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles</hi>,
          consisting of thirteen documents originally written
          in Greek, but found also in a Latin compilation
          probably of the 6th century. They are distinguished
          from the Apocryphal Gospels by having
          less of miracle and more of didactic discourse.
          The more important of the collection are <hi rend="italic">The
            Acts of Peter and Paul, The Acts of Barnabas</hi>,<pb n="56"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">The Acts of Philip, The Acts of Andrew, The
          Acts of Bartholomew</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The Acts of John</hi>. It
          is difficult to ascertain their age. Some are probably
          of earlier date than the Apocryphal Gospels,
          but the original MSS. are lost, and we only
          possess them in late transcripts of the middle
          ages. 3. The <hi rend="italic">Apocryphal Apocalypses</hi>, consisting
          of seven documents, four of which are called
          apocalypses by their authors. There is great
          and perplexing variety in the MSS. That called
          <hi rend="italic">The Apocalypse of Moses</hi> relates rather to the Old
          Testament than to the New ; so does <hi rend="italic">The Apocalypse
          of Esdras</hi>, which is a weak imitation of the
          Fourth Book of Esdras. The others are <hi rend="italic">The
          Apocalypse of Paul, The Apocalypse of John</hi>, and
          <hi rend="italic">The Assumption of Mary</hi> in three forms. These,
          too, only exist in late MSS. of the middle ages,
          and it is, of course, not quite certain that they are
          the same in form as the works bearing the same
          name referred to in the writings of the Fathers.
          The New Testament Apocrypha is not without
          interest or instruction for us. It throws a flood
          of light upon the workings of the early Christian
          consciousness and modes of thought, and it also
          enables us to appreciate the vast superiority of
          those Scriptures which have obtained canonical
          authority. - See Tischendorf's <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> to the
          Apocryphal Literature of the New Testament
          (Leipsic, 1873); and Clark's <hi rend="italic">Ante-Nicene Christian
          Library</hi>, vol. 16 (Edinburgh, 1870).</p>
                <p>Of very much greater importance for the history
          of the New Testament canon is another series
          of ancient Christian writings, which in various
          regions continued for a long time to be used in the
          churches in the same way as the books of the
          New Testament. The most important of them
          are the so-called <hi rend="italic">Gospel of the Hebrews</hi> (apparently
          closely related to the gospel of Matthew,
          and used by Jewish-Christian sects) ; the apparently
          very similar <hi rend="italic">Gospel of Peter</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic
          Constitutions</hi> ; and almost the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic
          Fathers</hi>. Of these (the two epistles of
          Clement of Rome, that of Barnabas, that of
          Ignatius, that of Polycarp, and the Shepherd of
          Hermas) the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd, Clement's</hi> epistles, and the
          epistle of <hi rend="italic">Barnabas</hi>, are sometimes found in old
          MSS. of the Bible ; but, though remaining most
          valuable monuments of primitive Christianity, they
          were gradually separated from the canon of the
          New Testament. The <hi rend="italic">antilegomena</hi> (discussed
          below) finally recognised as part of the canon,
          occupy a position intermediate between apocryphal
          writings and the books universally acknowledged by the Church.</p>

                <p>In touching upon the canonical literature of the
          New Testament, it may be necessary to make
          some preliminary remarks upon the relation in
          which it stands to that of the Old. A long-prevalent
          opinion identified the two so entirely as to
          find the latest developments of New Testament
          theology quite plainly revealed in the words of the
          Old Testament Scripture, and hardly recognised
          a real spiritual growth between Moses and Paul;
          Christianity seemed at most to be but an expansion
          of Judaism. Now the orthodox expositor
          gives free scope to the truth of a vast development
          between Old and New Testament times. Even
          those who most earnestly believe that priestly
          symbolism and prophetic vision infallibly shadowed
          forth the religion of Christ, admit with
          freedom that they did so but obscurely and incompletely.
          On the other hand, they allow that all
          true religion is essentially one, and whenever a
          patriarch, or priest, or psalmist, or prophet rose
          above the materialism or the formalism of his
          age, and entered into the inner sanctuary of truth,
          he stood upon the same spiritual platform, and
          breathed the same divine air as Christ and the
          apostles. The lives of Abraham and Moses, the
          lyrics of David and Asaph, the rapturous hopes
          of Isaiah, were a perpetual inspiration to their
          countrymen, keeping alive, in the darkest hours,
          the flame of heavenly faith and valour, and giving
          birth, in pious hearts, to new and nobler thoughts.
          The men who figure in the New Testament, and
          the men who wrote it, were nurtured upon the
          older literature ; but the world had changed since
          the days of Malachi, and a vast future had opened
          up before the spiritual vision of the Galilean saint
          and sage, in the presence of which national
          religions appeared mean, and the earth became
          an undivided home of the great family of man.
          This universalism of faith and love was ever and
          again finding a momentary expression in ancient
          psalm or prophecy, but it now became, for the
          first time, the fixed foundation of a majestic
          creed ; and although it may have been narrowed
          by smaller natures in the course of inevitable
          controversy, it remains for ever the glorious
          inheritance of Christendom.</p>
                <p>It must be admitted that the same difficulties,
          though in a lesser degree, shew themselves in
          regard to the origin and authorship of the New
          Testament literature, that met us when we were
          considering the Old. We do not know for certain
          that the writings in every case proceeded from the
          men whose names they bear, or belong to the age
          to which they are assigned, or have come down to
          us in the precise form they originally bore. The
          first three gospels are asserted by some to be the
          outcome of a lengthened period of traditionary
          growth. Of the two gospels ordinarily attributed
          to apostles, that bearing in its title to be by
          Matthew is regarded as by another hand, and
          the fourth gospel is assigned on various grounds
          to dates ranging from 110 A.D. to after the middle
          of that century. Several of the epistles accepted
          by the catholic church as Pauline, are declared
          to be by one whose style of thought differed
          entirely from that of the apostle of the Gentiles.
          The second epistle of Peter, in particular, is
          asserted to be pseudonymous.</p>

            <div>
                <head>NEW TESTAMENT CANON.</head>
                <p>This canon is a collection of writings containing
          the history and doctrines of Christianity, and may
          be divided into three chief sections : 1. The
          historical books, or the four gospels, and the Acts
          of the Apostles. 2. The didactic and pastoral
          writings, which include the Epistles of Paul to
          the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians,
          Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy,
          Titus, Philemon, the Hebrews, the two Epistles of
          Peter, the three Epistles of John, the Epistles
          of James and Jude. 3. The prophetical section,
          consisting only of one book, the Apocalypse, or
          Revelation of St John the Divine. The primitive
          Christians referred for proof of doctrine, &amp;c. only,<pb n="57"/>so far as we are aware, to the Old Testament, and
          quotations from it by the apostolic Fathers are
          numerous enough ; but we find few clear and
          certain references to the didactic portions of the
          New Testament. The Christians continued simply
          to appeal on all disputed points to the Scriptures,
          which had long been the treasure of the people
          of God, and which were still accessible to all
          believers. The generation which immediately
          succeeded that of the apostles did not consider
          the apostolic writings of equal importance as
          <hi rend="italic">writings</hi> with the sacred books of the Old
          Testament. Besides, most of the epistles were
          of little use in controversy, for the earliest heretics
          denied the apostleship of St Paul ; while both
          parties admitted the authority of the Septuagint,
          and found in it their common weapons of
          argument. Nevertheless, we occasionaUy find
          references to the didactic portions of the New
          Testament, such as those to Romans, 1 Corinthians,
          Ephesians, Hebrews, and James, in
          Clemens Romanus ; to 1 Corinthians and
          Ephesians, in Ignatius ; to Romans, 1 Corinthians,
          2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians,
          1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, 1 Peter, and 1 John,
          in Polycarp. Still more uncertain are the references
          of the apostolical Fathers to the gospels.
          The notices found in Barnabas, Clemens Romanus,
          Ignatius, and Polycarp are only sufficient to indicate
          that all the great facts of Christ's life were
          known to the churches, and that the doctrinal
          significance of these had begun to be realised.
          They do not, however, demonstrate the existence
          of written gospels, but they prove that Christianity
          rests on a historic basis. Their silence in relation
          to the written gospels now constituting a portion
          of the canon of the New Testament, is at first
          sight singular ; but when we reflect that the facts
          of the Saviour's life and teaching were apparently
          quite familiar to the churches - so familiar,
          indeed, that no explanation was needed in alluding
          to them - we see that the necessity of the
          apostolic Fathers quoting from the Evangelists
          ceases. It is contended that any specific quotations
          would have been a work of supererogation ;
          whereas, in the case of the didactic epistles, which
          were written originally for the benefit of particular
          churches, and conditioned by their special circumstances,
          and the contents of which, therefore,
          could not be so well or widely known, quotations
          or allusions might more naturally be looked for.
          But evidence of this <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> character for the
          existence of the evangelical records, however
          probable, is very uncertain, and its uncertainty
          is increased by the use made of writings which,
          at a later period, were rejected as apocryphal.
          First, in the second half of the 2d century, more
          distinct references to the gospels are found in
          Papias (died 163), in Justin Martyr (died 165),
          in his pupil Tatian (died 176), in Athenagoras
          (died 180), and in Theophilus, who wrote about
          the year 180. None of these writers, however,
          names the authors from whom he quotes, though
          Papias - the earliest, but not the most trustworthy
          of them - bears direct and minute testimony to the
          existence of gospels by St Matthew, St Mark, St
          John, the catholic epistles, and the Apocalypse,
          whence it has been concluded that the authenticity
          of the apostolic memoirs was not then settled, and
          perhaps not even investigated ; but anonymous
          quotation seems to have been a characteristic
          carelessness of the time, for of this kind are 117 of
          Justin Martyr's references to the Old Testament
          The great fact on which a constructive Christian
          criticism leans in regard to the evidence of these
          writers is, that they do not speak of the gospels
          or apostolic memoirs as things which had only
          recently made their appearance, but as well known
          and long established. Justin even states that the
          <q>apostolic memoirs</q> were regularly read in the
          churches for the edification of believers - a fact
          which clearly indicates their superior sanctity and
          universal reception.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the idea of a universally acknowledged
          New Testament canon is not discernible in
          the church in Justin Martyr's time. There is no
          positive evidence in favour of its existence ; but
          this is not to be wondered at, for the consciousness
          of freedom in the Holy Spirit, which penetrated
          the Christians of the 1st century; the opposition
          of the Judaising and anti-Judaising parties -
          which does unquestionably appear to have existed,
          though not in that exaggerated form in which
          it is apprehended by the Tübingen school ; the
          still living tradition of the apostles ; the difficulty
          of diffusing apostolic writings sent only to
          particular churches ; the absence of criticism ; the
          vacillation in determining the point where the
          apostolic men ceased ; the use in the worship of
          God of the Old Testament, and, in particular
          churches, of casual Christian writings not now
          looked upon as canonical : all these causes together
          operated in hindering, till the middle of
          the 2d century, a formal collection of New Testament
          writings of any compass or critical value,
          though it seems quite clear that they existed
          separately, and were regarded as the most authoritative
          records of the new dispensation. The
          earliest trace of such a collection (the ten Pauline
          epistles without the pastoral epistles) appears
          after the middle of the 2d century, in opposition
          to that Gnostic perversion of primitive Christianity
          which had been introduced by Marcion of Pontus.
          The <hi rend="italic">Muratorian Canon</hi> in the West, and the
          <hi rend="italic">Peshito</hi> in the East, both belonging to this
          period, which has been called the <q>Age of the
          Apologists</q>, furnish important evidence in regard
          to the New Testament Canon, for both refer to
          nearly every book now received as authoritative,
          the exceptions being, in the former, the
          Epistle of James, the Epistle to the Hebrews,
          and 2 Peter ; in the latter, Jude, 2 Peter, 2
          and 3 John, and the Apocalypse. In the
          close of the 2d, and in the beginning of the
          3d century, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, and
          Tertullian bear testimony to the recognition of
          the four gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, the
          thirteen Pauline epistles, the 1st Epistle of Peter,
          the 1st Epistle of John, and the Apocalypse, as
          canonical writings. But they do even more
          than bear testimony to their recognition - they
          appeal to antiquity for proof of the authenticity
          of the books which they used as Christian Scriptures.
          On this point, Tertullian is especially
          precise, and his most convincing argument on
          behalf of the <q>surety of the gospels</q> is, that <q>the
          very heretics bear witness to them.</q> They did
          not, it is admitted, acknowledge the whole of
          the New Testament canon, but this is explicable
          on the hypothesis, which is justified by investigation,
          that the portions rejected were those that
          seemed alien to their own opinions. Two distinct<pb n="58"/>collections of writings are now noticed - the
          <hi rend="italic">Instrumentum Evangelicum</hi> containing the four
          gospels ; and the <hi rend="italic">Instrumentum Apostolicum</hi>,
          containing the Acts of the Apostles, along with
          the Pauline and other epistles. Respecting
          several parts of the New Testament canon, differences
          of opinion prevailed in early times, nor was
          the war of criticism closed until the 6th century,
          for considerable difference of opinion existed in
          regard to the value of the testimony of the early
          apologetic authors. Origen doubted the authority
          of the Epistle to the Hebrews, of the Epistle of
          James, of Jude, of the 2d of Peter, and the 2d
          and 3d of John ; while, at the same time, he was
          disposed to recognise as canonical certain apocryphal
          scriptures, such as those of Hermas and
          Barnabas, which were decidedly rejected by the
          Church. The Apocalypse was treated as a dubious
          part of the canon down to the 7th century. The
          learned and circumspect Father, Eusebius, in the
          4th century, in a passage of his <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi>,
          distinguishes three classes of New Testament
          Scriptures : 1. Universally received Scriptures
          (<hi rend="italic">homologoumena</hi>)—the four gospels, the Acts of
          the Apostles, the fourteen Pauline epistles, the 1st
          Epistle of John, the 1st of Peter, and, with a
          certain reservation, the Apocalypse of John. 2.
          Scriptures not universally received, or not received
          at all. These he calls <q>disputed</q> (<hi rend="italic">antilegomena</hi>)
          and subdivides them into such as were generally
          known and approved by most - namely, the epistles
          of James, Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John ; and such
          as were <q>spurious</q> (<hi rend="italic">notha</hi>) - namely, the Acts of
          Paul, the Shepherd, the Apocalypse of Peter, the
          Epistle of Barnabas, the Institutes of the Apostles,
          and the Gospel of the Hebrews. 3. Heretical forgeries,
          such as the gospels of Peter and Thomas,
          which Eusebius pronounces to be <q>altogether
          absurd and impious</q>.</p>
                <p>The Western Church, which was more conservative
          and less critical than the Eastern Church,
          completed the canon with greater rapidity. Although
          the eastern Council of Laodicea (360-364),
          in determining the canon of the New Testament,
          excluded the Apocalypse, the western synods of
          Hippo-Regius (393), Carthage (397), the Roman
          bishop, Innocent I. (in the beginning of the 5th
          century), and the <hi rend="italic">Concilium Romanum</hi> under
          Gelasius I. (494), recognised the entire canon of
          the New Testament as we find it in the present
          day. The doubts entertained by individuals
          respecting some parts of the canon had become
          exceptional and unimportant at the close of the
          7th century. Owing to the want of Greek scholarship,
          as also, perhaps, to the growing idea of an
          infallible church papacy, there was no criticism
          worthy of the name during the middle ages.
          Doubts, therefore, respecting the Epistle to the 1
          Hebrews and the Epistles of James and Jude
          were first revived, after a long quietude, at the
          time of the Reformation. Luther himself ventured
          to declare the Epistle to the Hebrews and
          the Apocalypse <q>apocryphal</q>; and the Epistle of
          James he pronounced <q>an epistle of mere straw,
          having nothing of the gospel about it</q>. But in
          both cases he proceeded, not on critical, but on
          purely dogmatic grounds. The spirit of orthodox
          inactivity which ruled the Protestant Church
          from the latter part of the 16th to the middle
          of the 18th century, had a deadening effect on true
          Biblical criticism. This was first revived by a
          liberal Catholic writer, Richard Simon (died 1712),
          who first conceived the plan of <q>an historicocritical
          introduction</q> to the Bible. Afterwards,
          the labours of Lowth, Semler, Herder, Griesbach,
          Michaelis, Eichhorn, and others, gave a new impulse
          to scriptural exegesis. In Germany, we may
          name among writers on the conservative and
          orthodox side, the Catholic divines Jahn and
          Hug, with the Protestant writers, Hengstenberg,
          Hävernick, Guerike, Delitzsch, and Caspari : on
          the other side, Berthold, De Wette, Credner,
          Reuss ; and since the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Life of
          Jesus</hi> by Strauss, the <q>New Tübingen school</q>,
          with F. C. Baur at its head, has questioned the
          authenticity and apostolical antiquity of all the
          New Testament scriptures, except the four larger
          Epistles of Paul - to the Romans, the Corinthians
          (1st and 2d), and the Galatians.</p>
                <p>But, as might have been expected, the effects
          of the strife could not always remain confined
          to Germany. They have been felt more or less
          over all Protestant countries ; and even Catholic
          France, which has no theology to contend for,
          shews the influence of the new movement.
          Renan's <hi rend="italic">Vie de Jésus</hi> produced a vivid sensation,
          and has been followed by a series of works on the
          apostolic age. In England, during the 18th century,
          several valuable apologetic works had been
          published, such as Lardner's <hi rend="italic">Credibility of the
          Gospel History</hi>, and Paley's <hi rend="italic">Horae Paulinae</hi>. In
          the early part of the 19th century appeared
          Horne's <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of the Scriptures</hi>,
          which has been frequently reprinted.
          Since then, Tregelles, Davidson, Westcott, and
          numerous other scholars, have entered the field ;
          and it is not too much to affirm that there exists
          at this moment a keener spirit of impartial inquiry,
          as regards the foundations of Biblical criticism,
          than Britain has ever previously witnessed.</p>

                <head>PRINTED EDITIONS OF THE TEXT.</head>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Old Testament</hi>. - The earliest printed editions
          of the Hebrew Bible bear a close resemblance to
          the manuscripts. <q>They are without titles at the
          commencement, have appendices, are printed on
          parchment with broad margin, and large illshaped
          type, the <hi rend="italic">initial</hi> letters being commonly
          ornamented either with wood-cut engravings or
          by the pen. These letters, however, are often
          absent. With vowels, the editions in question
          are very imperfectly supplied. Separate parts
          of the Bible were first printed.</q> The Psalms
          appeared in 1477, probably at Bologna ; the Pentateuch
          at Bologna in 1482 ; the Prophets in 1486;
          the Hagiographa in 1487. To most of these were
          subjoined the rabbinical commentary of Kimchi.
          The whole of the Old Testament appeared in
          small folio at Soncino, 1488, and appears to have
          been followed by the edition of Brescia (1494),
          which was used by Luther in his translation of
          the Old Testament. The <hi rend="italic">Biblia Polyglotta Complutensia</hi>
          (1514-1517), the <hi rend="italic">Biblia Rabbinica</hi> of
          Bomberg, edited by Rabbi Jacob-Ben-Chayim
          (Venice, 1525-1526), which has been adopted in
          most of the subsequent editions - the Antwerp
          <hi rend="italic">Biblia Polyglotta</hi> (8 vols. 1569-1572), also the
          editions by Hutterus (Hamburg, 1587, and frequently
          reprinted), Buxtorf (Basel, 1611), and
          especially that by Jos. Athias (Amsterdam, 1661-
          1667) - all these are celebrated, and have supplied<pb n="59"/>the basis of later editions by Simon, Hahn, Theile,
          and others. The controversy regarding the purity
          of the Masoretic text in the 17th century led to
          an extensive examination of Hebrew manuscripts
          in the next century. Kennicott collated 630 - 258
          throughout, the rest in part ; De Rossi, 751, of
          which all but 17 were collated for the first time.
          Many still remain uncollated. The result of this
          elaborate investigation has been to convince
          scholars that the Masoretic text is substantially
          correct.</p>
                <p>At first, there were no intervening spaces between
          Hebrew words ; afterwards, small intervals
          appear to have been occasionally allowed. With
          the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">square</hi> character, the use
          of small interstices to separate words became
          general. The Talmud prescribes how much space
          should be between words in sacred manuscripts
          designed for the synagogue. Various divisions
          according to the sense were also introduced at an
          early period. In the Pentateuch there were two,
          termed respectively <hi rend="italic">open</hi> and <hi rend="italic">closed</hi>. The former
          were intended to mark a change in the matter of
          the text ; the latter, slight changes in the sense. Of
          these, the Pentateuch contained 669, named <hi rend="italic">perashioth</hi>
          (sections). This division is probably as
          old, or nearly so, as the practice of reading the
          Law. It is found in the Talmud, while the division
          into 54 <hi rend="italic">great perashioth</hi> is first found in the
          Masora, and is not observed in the rolls of the
          synagogues. The poetical books were also subjected,
          from a very early period, to a stichometrical
          division, according to the peculiarities of
          Hebrew versification. In order to facilitate the
          reading and understanding of the prose books, a
          division into logical periods was also made. Our
          present division of the Old Testament into chapters
          is a later invention, and, though accepted by
          the Jews, is of Christian origin ; it may be dated
          as far back as the 13th century, some assigning it
          to Cardinal Hugo, others to Stephen Langton,
          Archbishop of Canterbury. It was first employed
          in a concordance to the Vulgate, whence it was
          borrowed by Rabbin Nathan in the 15th century,
          who made a similar concordance to the Hebrew
          Bible. Nathan's divisions are found in Bomberg's
          Hebrew Bible of 1518. Verses were first
          introduced into editions of the Hebrew Bible by
          Athias of Amsterdam, 1661, but were employed in
          the Vulgate as early as 1558. The first <hi rend="italic">English
          Bible</hi> divided into verses was published at Geneva
          in 1560.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">New Testament</hi>. - The original manuscripts of
          the New Testament were probably all written on
          papyrus, the cheapest, but least durable material
          that could be obtained for the purpose. It was
          therefore impossible, considering the constant
          handling to which the documents must have
          been subjected by the eager converts, that they
          could have lasted for any length of time. We
          know, indeed, that a very large number of
          copies were in existence from an early period.
          Norton states the number at about 40,000. The
          text of these, however, did not always agree.
          Variations originated, to a considerable extent,
          from the same causes as operated in the case of
          the Old Testament, namely, imperfect vision or
          hearing, misunderstanding, carelessness, or an uncritical
          judgment on the part of transcribers ; but
          it is natural to suppose that, on account of the
          greater freedom of spirit and thought which characterised primitive Christianity, compared with
          Judaism, a latitude of conviction in regard to the
          value of the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of Scripture also influenced the
          churches. Modern criticism reckons no less than
          80,000 variations in the existing manuscripts. Of
          these manuscripts, upwards of 1400 are known to
          scholars, and have been collated, and no essential
          discrepancy has been detected.</p>
                <p>Some slight attempts seem to have been made,
          during the early history of the Church, to obtain a
          correct text. One Lucian, a presbyter of Antioch,
          and Hesychius, an Egyptian bishop, are said by
          Jerome to have undertaken a recension of the
          New Testament, and both Origen and Jerome
          himself were of considerable service in this respect.
          It is to modern criticism, however, that we
          owe almost everything in regard to the regulation
          of the text. Bengel and Semler first started the
          idea of arranging the manuscripts of the New Testament
          into <hi rend="italic">families</hi> or <hi rend="italic">classes</hi>. After these came
          Griesbach, who, following out the idea, propounded
          his famous threefold division of the manuscripts
          into Western, Alexandrian, and Byzantine. The
          first two he considers the oldest ; the third, a corrupt
          mixture of both. Griesbach himself preferred
          the Alexandrian : he believed that the Byzantine
          transcribers had taken great liberties with the
          text, and held that a few Alexandrian manuscripts
          outweighed, in critical value, a large number of
          the other. The accuracy of Griesbach's division
          has subsequently been questioned by many eminent
          German scholars, among whom may be
          mentioned Hug, Matthiä, Scholz, and Eichhorn,
          each of whom has in turn favoured the world
          with a theory of his own in regard to the probable
          value of the various families of manuscripts.
          Recently, Lachmann has applied, with excessive
          strictness, a principle first hinted by Bentley,
          namely, that no weight ought to be attached to
          any manuscripts except those written in the old
          or uncial character. The chief advocate for the
          application of this principle in England is Tregelles
          ; but it is rejected by the vast majority of
          biblical scholars, for the simple reason, that a
          manuscript of the 10th or 11th century, if faithful
          to that from which it is copied (a thing not impossible),
          may exhibit a really older and purer text
          than one of the 4th or 5th century. The exact
          value of each manuscript is still a matter of dispute
          ; but a great deal has been done to place the
          knowledge of the various lines of evidence within
          the reach of all scholars. Especially, Tischendorf
          has carefully examined the most important of the
          uncial manuscripts, and published them separately,
          somewhat after the fashion of a fac-simile. He
          has also published a fac-simile of the <hi rend="italic">Codex Sinaiticus</hi>,
          which he found in a monastery on Mount
          Sinai in 1859.</p>
                <p>The whole of the New Testament was first
          printed in the Complutensian Polyglott, 1514.
          From 1516 to 1535, five editions appeared at
          Basel, under the care of Erasmus, but without
          any great pretensions to critical accuracy. The
          subsequent numerous editions were, for the most
          part, either founded on the editions of Erasmus
          or on the Complutensian, or on a collation of
          both. Among these editions we may mention
          that by Colonäi (Paris, 1534), by Bogard (Paris,
          1543), the third by the elder Stephens (1550), and
          that by the younger Stephens (Geneva, 1569).
          Beza was the first who, by several collations<pb n="60"/>founded on the third edition by Stephens, made
          any considerable progress in the critical treatment
          of the text, and thus supplied a basis for
          the present received text (<hi rend="italic">textus receptus</hi>), which
          was first printed by Stephens with the Vulgate
          and critical annotations at Geneva, 1565 ; afterwards
          was frequently reprinted by Elzevir (Leyden,
          1624) and others. Other editors are Walton, Fell,
          and Mill, in England in the 17th century ; the
          Germans Bengel, Wetstein, Semler, and Griesbach,
          in the 18th century ; and in this century, Scholz,
          Rink, Lachmann, Buttman, and Tischendorf, in
          Germany ; and in England, Tregelles, Scrivener,
          and Westcott and Hort (in 1881).</p>
                <p>Among the manuscripts of the New Testament,
          the oldest are not traced back further than the 4th
          century, and are written in the so-called <hi rend="italic">uncial</hi>
          characters. The modern manuscripts, dating from
          the 10th century downwards, are distinguished by
          the <hi rend="italic">cursive</hi> characters in which they are written.
          The most important manuscripts are the <hi rend="italic">Codex
          Sinaiticus</hi> (at St Petersburg), the <hi rend="italic">C. Alexandrinus</hi>
          (in the British Museum), <hi rend="italic">C. Vaticanus</hi>
          (in the Vatican at Rome), <hi rend="italic">C. Ephraemi</hi> (in the
          Imperial Library at Paris), and <hi rend="italic">C. Cantabrigiensis</hi>,
          or <hi rend="italic">C. Bezae</hi> (given by Beza to the university of
          Cambridge). The best authorities refer the
          <hi rend="italic">Sinaiticus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Vaticanus</hi> to the middle of
          the 4th century ; <hi rend="italic">Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ephraemi</hi> to
          the 5th century ; and <hi rend="italic">Bezae</hi> to the 6th century.
          The 7th century furnishes but a few fragments.
          The MSS. of the 9th and 10th centuries are as
          numerous as all the earlier ones put together.
          The <hi rend="italic">cursive</hi> MSS. are about 1000 in number, and
          date from the 10th to the 16th centuries.</p>

                <head>BIBLE VERSIONS OR TRANSLATIONS.</head>
                <p>These may be divided into ancient and modern.
          The ancient translations of the Old Testament
          are noticed under the sections <hi rend="italic">Septuagint, Old
          Syriac Version</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Samaritan Pentateuch</hi>.
          As has been mentioned, the Peshito contains also
          a Syriac translation of the Greek New Testament
          The <hi rend="italic">Old Latin</hi> version of the Old and New
          Testament seems to have originated in Africa,
          and seems probably to have comprised several
          distinct translations, the Old Testament being
          done from the LXX. Towards the close of the
          4th century a revision was undertaken by St
          Jerome, and finally the greater part of the Old
          Testament was translated by him from the
          Hebrew. This version became ultimately known
          as the <hi rend="italic">Vulgate</hi>, though its text was corrupted by
          the influence of the older version. The Vulgate
          was declared the authorised version of the
          Catholic Church by the Council of Trent in 1546,
          and its text was carefully revised in 1593 under
          Pope Clement VIII.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Modern Translation</hi>s. - During the middle ages
          various poetical versions - such as the Gospel
          History by Otfried von Weissenburg, and the
          version of Job and of the Psalms by Notker-
          Labeo (980) - served a very important object.
          In 1170, Petrus Waldus caused the New Testament
          to be translated into the Provencal dialect
          by Etienne d'Anse. There were translations
          under Louis the Pious (1227) and Charles
          the Wise (1380), the Bible Histories (<hi rend="italic">Bible
          ystorieus</hi>) by Guyars of Moulins (1286), the
          Spanish version under Alfonso V. in the 13th
          century, the English by Wickliffe, and the
          Bohemian version of John Huss. After the invention
          of printing - especially after the latter
          part of the 15th century - the harbingers of a new
          ecclesiastical era appeared in numerous republications
          of the translated Bible - the Bohemian
          (Prague, 1448) ; the Italian, by the Benedictine
          Nic. Malherbi (1471) ; the French, by Des
          Moulins (1477-1546) ; the Dutch (Delf, 1477) ; the
          Spanish (1478-1515) ; but, above all, in the seventeen
          German translations before Luther, of which
          five were printed before 1477, and the remainder
          during 1477-1518 (and three in Low-German).</p>
                <p>Luther's translation of the Bible is universally
          esteemed by the best German scholars as a masterpiece
          of genial interpretation. The New Testament
          was finished in the Wartburg, and appeared
          in September 1522. In the following year, the
          five books of Moses appeared ; and, in 1534, the
          remaining part of the Old Testament canon was
          completed along with the Apocrypha. With
          wonderful rapidity, this translation was circulated
          throughout Germany. In the course of forty
          years, one bookseller, Hans Luft of Wittenberg,
          sold 100,000 copies - an astonishing number,
          when we consider the price of books in the 16th
          century. It was reprinted thirty-eight times in
          Germany before 1559, and meanwhile, the New
          Testament had been separately printed in seventy-two
          editions. Numerous other translations in
          Dutch, Swedish, &amp;c. were based upon the work
          of Luther.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">English Translations of the Bible</hi>. - The first
          of modern English translators of the Bible was
          William Tyndale, whose sympathy with the
          opinions of the German reformers compelled him
          to seek refuge on the continent. Before 1526, he
          had completed an English translation of the New
          Testament, which appeared both in quarto and
          duodecimo. In the beginning of 1526, the volumes
          were secretly conveyed into England. Of the
          admirable character of his translation, we have a
          sufficient testimony in this fact, that in our
          present version a very large portion of the New
          Testament is taken almost <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> from Tyndale's
          Testament. In 1530, he published the
          Pentateuch, and in the following year, the Book
          of Jonah. The first English version of the
          whole Bible was that published by Miles Coverdale,
          a friend of Tyndale. It is dated 1535, and
          dedicated to Henry VIII., but where printed, is
          unknown. The next EngUlish Bible issued was
          called <hi rend="italic">Matthew's Bible</hi>, from the circumstance
          that the editor assumed the name of Thomas
          Matthew, but was simply Tyndale's version revised
          by his friend John Rogers, who also translated
          those books in the Old Testament which
          Tyndale had not been able to overtake. It was
          finished in 1537, and Cranmer obtained for it the
          patronage of Henry. In April 1539 appeared
          the <hi rend="italic">Great Bible</hi>, usually called Cranmer's, because
          he wrote a preface to it. It was a large volume,
          for use in churches. The text was Tyndale's
          revised. In 1557 appeared the famous <hi rend="italic">Geneva
          Bible</hi>, so called because the translation was executed
          there by several English divines, who had
          fled from the persecutions of Mary. Among
          these may be mentioned Gilby and Whittingham.
          This edition - the first printed in Roman
          letter and divided into verses - was accompanied
          by notes, which shewed a strong leaning to the<pb n="59"/>views of Calvin and Beza. It was, in consequence,
          long the favourite version of the English Puritans
          and the Scotch Presbyterians. In 1568, the
          <hi rend="italic">Bishops' Bible</hi> was published at London. The
          text of this was compared with the original by
          eight bishops, and several other scholars of reputation,
          who appended their initials to their respective
          tasks ; the whole being under the superintendence
          of Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury.
          In 1582 appeared at Rheims, in France,
          an English version of the New Testament, prepared
          by several Roman Catholic exiles ; and in
          1609-1610, a similar version of the Old Testament
          at Douay. Both were taken from the
          Vulgate, and form the standard English Scriptures
          of the Roman Catholics, being generally
          known as the <hi rend="italic">Douay Bible</hi>.</p>
                <p>We now come to the version which has been
          in common use for more than 250 years, generally
          called <hi rend="italic">King James's Bible</hi>. At the Hampton
          Court Conference in January 1604, Dr Rainolds,
          an eminent Puritan, suggested a new translation
          as a great national want. Arrangements were at
          once made for carrying out the project. In July,
          the king wrote a letter, intimating the appointment
          of 54 scholars for the preparation of the
          version. Of these 54, only 47 undertook the work.
          These were divided into six companies, two of
          which were to meet at Westminster, two at Cambridge,
          and two at Oxford. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> company at
          Westminster translated the Pentateuch and the
          historical books to the end of 2d Kings ; the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
          at Cambridge, from the beginning of Chronicles
          to the end of Canticles ; and the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> at Oxford
          undertook the remaining books of the Old Testament
          canon. The second company at Westminster
          translated the apostolic epistles ; the second
          at Cambridge, the Apocrypha ; and the second at
          Oxford, the gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and
          the Apocalypse. According to <cit>

          &amp;c. If they found any fault, they spoke ; if not,
          he read on.'</quote>
                    </cit> When a portion was finished by one
          of the company, it was sent to all the others in
          succession for their deliberative examination ; and
          whenever a difference of opinion was elicited,
          reference was made to a committee. The final
          revision of the whole was conducted in London by
          two delegates from each of the six companies.
          The work of translation and revision occupied
          from 1607 to 1610. The superiority of the authorised
          version soon proved itself; for though there
          were several rivals in the field, and no steps were
          taken to secure for it a preference, it quickly
          gained the foremost place, and in the course of
          forty years from its publication, all others had
          quietly succumbed to it ; it became, and has ever
          since remained, <hi rend="italic">the English Bible</hi>.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, it has long been felt that the
          authorised version, noble as it is, had defects
          which modern scholarship might fairly be called
          on to remove ; especially in regard to precise
          accuracy of translation and the interpretation of
          obscure passages. The English bishops recommended
          that a revision of the existing translation
          should be undertaken; and in 1870 Convocation
          appointed a committee for the purpose, comprising
          amongst its number many of the most distinguished
          Biblical scholars of various denominations. The
          first meeting of the Committee of Revision was
          held in Westminster Abbey, 22d June 1870 ; and
          their translation of the New Testament was published
          in 1881. The numerous recent translations
          of the Scriptures into languages beyond the pale
          of Christendom, have been executed chiefly under
          the auspices of Missionary and Bible Societies.</p>
                <p>As to the <hi rend="italic">contents</hi> of the Bible, its one grand
          object, under whatever form it may appear in the
          various books, is to give an account of this world,
          both in its origin and government, as the work
          of an Almighty Creator, always and everywhere
          present ; and especially to exhibit the relation of
          man to this Creator, and, in consequence of that
          relation, in what manner, and with what hopes he
          ought to live and die - subjects undeniably the
          most momentous that can occupy human thought.
          The sacred books of other religions have all an
          analogous aim ; to account, namely, for the origin
          of all things, and to explain the nature and human
          relations of that something <hi rend="italic">divine</hi>, which it is an
          instinct of the human mind to conceive as actuating
          and controlling all that moves. But so different -
          so immeasurably superior to all other sacred
          books, is the Bible, in the conception it unfolds of
          the divine nature as one personal God, exercising
          towards men the love and care of a parent to his
          offspring, and in the system of human duties
          springing therefrom, that on this consideration
          alone it deserves a measure of human reverence
          and trust, that can be accorded by an enlightened
          intelligence to no other religious composition.
          The doctrines of Christ give a spiritual unity to
          the whole history and literature of the Hebrew
          people. If the statements which have been placed
          before the reader militate against the longcherished
          notions concerning the origin and
          nature of the canon, and if old views as to the
          nature of inspiration should have to be modified,
          it will still remain as a thing credible and true,
          that the Founder of our religion gathered up in
          his own person, and unfolded in his teaching, the
          sublimest truths of religion. To Him, in a higher
          than a mechanical sense, the Law and the Prophets
          pointed. We can take up, and even emphasise
          the language of the apostolic theologians, and
          declare with unfeigned sincerity, that He is the
          brightness of his Father's glory, and the express
          image of his person.</p>

                <head>THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH.</head>
                <p>The Church is, according to the broad Scriptural
          view, the organisation or company of genuine
          Christians, established for the promotion of
          each other's edification, and for the propagation
          of Christianity ; and thus including Christ's followers
          of all ranks, countries, and ages, it now
          forms a vast spiritual kingdom, which contrasts
          strikingly with the 120 disciples gathered in an
          <q>upper room</q> in Jerusalem. Even in reference
          to its denominational subdivisions, several of
          these have had a most imposing external history,
          and still exercise a mighty influence in the world.</p>
                <p>The original Church was constituted at Jerusalem
          on the day of Pentecost, when three thousand
          persons were converted to the new faith.
          They are represented as <q>continuing steadfastly
          in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in breaking
          of bread, and in prayer</q> - language which
          denotes the organisation, the ordinances, and the<pb n="62"/>regular life of a church. Persecution, however,
          soon arose out of the hatred with which the
          Jewish Christians were regarded by the influential
          men of their own nation. This season
          of trial for the young Church lasted five years,
          and only ended when the persecutors themselves
          were in open quarrel with the Roman
          governors. It is probable that the persecution
          in the capital had dispersed not a few
          of the Christians, and led to the formation of
          churches in the distant provinces of Judea.
          Immediately after, the first Gentile Church was
          founded, and its seat was Antioch, where Paul
          began his labours as an apostle, and whence
          he took frequent missionary excursions into the
          adjacent countries. The Church in this important
          city had the same rank among Gentile associations
          which the Church at Jerusalem enjoyed
          among those of Palestine. The Church at Rome,
          which had enjoyed the labours and witnessed the
          martyrdom of Paul, became involved in a cruel
          persecution ; the Emperor Nero having charged
          the Christians with the crime of setting fire to
          the city, though he was himself supposed to be
          the incendiary. It is on this occasion that the
          Roman historians take the first notice of the
          Christians ; and it is abundantly evident that
          the latter were only known to the former through
          the reports of bitter enemies.</p>
                <p>When the doom of Jerusalem was impending,
          many of the Christians are supposed to have
          taken timely refuge in Pella, a village beyond
          Jordan. Wherever the power of the Roman empire
          extended, Christianity followed, in spite of deadly
          persecution. A few years after the apostolic age,
          the sect was numerous in Bithynia, in Asia
          Minor ; though Pliny, the Roman governor, as
          he explains in a letter to Trajan, questioned with
          threats the Christians about their religion, and
          when they would not recant, ordered them to be
          led to execution. In the West, a still more unrelenting
          persecution raged against them in the
          reigns of successive emperors ; and when the
          imperial cruelty occasionally relaxed a little, a
          bloodthirsty populace hunted down the Christians,
          who yet multiplied everywhere, and gained accessions
          from every rank.</p>
                <p>According to Mosheim, the government of the
          primitive churches was somewhat as follows :
          The assembly of the people chose their own
          rulers and teachers, or received them by a free
          and authoritative consent, when recommended
          by others. They rejected or confirmed, by their
          suffrages, the laws proposed by their rulers to
          the assembly ; excommunicated unworthy members
          ; restored the penitent ; passed judgment
          on subjects of controversy that arose in their
          community ; and exercised supreme authority.
          The rulers of the church were either <hi rend="italic">presbyters</hi> or
          <hi rend="italic">bishops</hi> - two titles applied in the New Testament
          to the same order of men. Their particular functions
          might vary ; for, while some of them confined
          their labours to teaching, others edified the
          church by <hi rend="italic">ruling</hi>; and hence the distinction between
          <hi rend="italic">teaching</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ruling</hi> presbyters. Three
          or four presbyters, men of remarkable piety and
          wisdom, ruled the small congregations, nor did
          they need any president to maintain concord.
          But the number of the presbyters increasing with
          that of the churches, and the work of the ministry
          growing more weighty, by additional duties, these
          new circumstances required new regulations. It
          was judged necessary that one man of distinguished
          wisdom should preside in the council of
          presbyters, to distribute to his colleagues their
          tasks, and to be a centre of union to the whole
          society. This person was at first styled the <hi rend="italic">angel</hi>
          of the church to which he belonged ; but afterwards
          <hi rend="italic">bishop</hi>. A bishop, during the first and second
          centuries, had only the care of one Christian assembly,
          which was generally small enough to be
          contained in a private house ; there he acted, not
          so much with the authority of a master, as with the
          diligence of a servant. He instructed, conducted
          public worship, attended the sick, and inquired into
          the circumstances and supplies of the poor. He
          charged, indeed, the presbyters with the performance
          of those duties which the multiplicity of his
          own engagements rendered it impossible for him
          to fulfil, but had not the power to decide anything
          without the consent of presbyters and people.
          The jurisdiction of the bishops was not long confined
          to these limits. The bishops in the cities
          had, either by their own ministry, or by that of
          their presbyters, erected new churches in neighbouring
          towns and villages ; and these, continuing
          under the inspection of the bishops, grew into
          ecclesiastical provinces, which were afterwards
          called <hi rend="italic">dioceses</hi>. As a city bishop could not extend
          his ministry to all the churches which he had
          planted, he appointed suffragans or deputies to
          instruct and govern them ; and those deputies
          called <hi rend="italic">chorepiscopi</hi> (country bishops) - were inferior
          to the bishops, but superior to the presbyters.</p>
                <p>A slight acquaintance with human nature will
          lead us to see how easy it was for city bishops -
          who, in the superintendence of their churches,
          were the apostles' successors - to arrogate not a
          little of the power which belonged exclusively to
          the apostles, as inspired and divinely appointed
          servants of Christ. It was but natural, also, that
          their lordly tendencies should be confirmed by
          the wealth and splendour to which Constantine
          exalted them when he became the convert and
          the patron of Christianity. The great body of
          the church members, too, would almost willingly
          surrender their power and independence to dignitaries
          who held such a high rank in the empire.
          In fact, the organisation that the church assumed
          was almost a copy of that of the civil society in
          the midst of which it arose. It was almost inevitable
          that it should be so ; nor can we agree
          with those who, taking their stand on what they
          conceive to have been the apostolic practice, and
          altogether forgetting those laws which a wider
          survey of history shews us to pervade all human
          societies whatever, hold the ecclesiastical system
          which gradually developed itself into a papal head
          for the Western Church, and a patriarchal head
          for the Eastern, to have been nothing but abuse
          and corruption. Certain it is that most of the
          errors which corrupted primitive Christianity were
          developed long before the period of ecclesiastical
          domination. The body of doctrine now in the
          Greek Church existed there long before the time
          of the patriarchate ; and the dogmas of the Church
          of Rome which Protestants denounce, had their
          place long before the papal power. But even the
          medieval institutions and practices of the Church
          of Rome are not to be blindly and extravagantly
          assailed. 'Their monasteries were mission-stations,
          which resembled ours in being dispensaries for the<pb n="63"/>sick, alms-houses for the poor, and nurseries of
          learning.</p>
                <p>Down to the Reformation, church history is
          divided between the Western or Roman, and the
          Eastern or Greek Churches. These churches
          still include within their pale by far the greater
          part of Christendom. The five principal strongholds
          of Christianity, in primitive times, were
          Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople,
          and Rome ; and in them resided the five bishops
          who had the oversight of the Church's affairs.
          The Church in the imperial capital had, from
          natural causes, an early importance ; it was the
          most opulent society, and its first bishops and
          presbyters were men of the highest character.
          Hence, though the Church at Antioch had been the
          mother-church of the Gentiles, and that at Jerusalem
          the earliest of all the churches, the Church
          of Rome claimed and received a certain pre-eminence.
          In the East, Alexandria was next to Rome
          in influence, but soon had to yield the primacy to
          Constantinople, which, though the youngest of the
          patriarchates, yet in 381 ranked second only to
          Rome. To be second, however, was not enough ;
          and the fact of the Emperor Constantine having
          adorned it, and taken up his residence in it, was but
          one out of many circumstances which led Constantinople
          to claim equality with Rome, and fostered
          jealousies between the rival sees. The great Arian
          heresy sprang up in the East, but the famous
          Nicene Council denounced and punished it ; and
          from that council the Bishop of Rome was absent
          through old age. Afterwards, the Arians gained
          an ascendency in the East, whilst the West continued
          orthodox, and this led to a suspension
          of communion between the two churches. The
          breach widened, and for a century and a half they
          disputed about the limits of their respective jurisdictions.
          At length, towards the close of the 5th
          century, the Patriarch of Constantinople was
          excommunicated by his Roman brother ; and as
          the former was supported by his three brethren in
          the East, the rupture was serious. In the 8th
          century occurred the <hi rend="italic">filioque</hi> dispute about the
          Holy Spirit's <q>procession</q>, and this was followed
          by the iconoclastic controversy, during which the
          bishops of Rome not only excommunicated their
          eastern brethren, but also renounced their allegiance
          to the Emperor of Constantinople. The
          rupture between the two churches became final in
          the 9th century, succeeding ages down to the
          present having only added new elements of alienation.
          The Germanic invasions which broke the
          imperial power in the West, had greatly increased
          the authority of the Roman bishops or popes;
          and though Southern and Central Italy still professed
          subjection to the Greek emperor and to the
          <hi rend="italic">exarchs</hi> who represented him, the ecclesiastics
          were fast monopolising civil functions and political
          influence. On the emperor authorising his
          exarch to enforce in the West the decree against
          all images which he had carried out in the East,
          the Latin people rose up in resistance, and the
          popes, as their champions, went the length of
          renouncing all allegiance to the imperial rule.
          The Italian territories which thus threw off the
          imperial yoke, were, after having been seized by 
          the Lombards, who aspired to extend their
          sovereignty from Northern to Central and Southern
          Italy, recovered by the king of the Franks,
          and given up by him to the popes themselves
          (in 756) ; and thus was laid the foundation of the
          temporal power of the papacy. The ecclesiastical
          primacy of the Roman prelates had long
          been admitted in many quarters far and near, and
          it was now boldly exalted into universal supremacy.
          Nicholas I. (858-867) is regarded as the
          first Roman pontiff who realised the long-cherished
          hope of undisputed spiritual pre-eminence and
          domination in the West. The Greek or Eastern
          Churches repudiated both the theory and the
          fact of papal supremacy ; and they continued to
          do so, and to differ from several dogmas and
          ceremonies of the Romish Church, even when
          the encroachments of the Mohammedan faith and
          arms had curtailed the Greek Empire, and taken
          possession of all the holy places in the East.
          Nor did the various crusades from the Western
          nations, undertaken at a stupendous cost of
          treasure and blood, to recover the sacred territory,
          conciliate the Eastern Church. The capture
          of Constantinople (1453) by the Ottoman
          Turks, and the departure of the last shadow of
          Roman majesty in the East - for previously every
          province had been torn out of the grasp of
          Caesar's descendants - did not induce the trembling
          Church in the East to strike a league with
          her exalted sister in the West. She has since
          pursued her own way, held her own tenets -
          which, whilst anti-Roman, are still more anti-
          Protestant - and invariably refused to listen to
          negotiations for a union with the Church of Rome.
          When, in 1848, Pio Nono called upon the Greek
          patriarchs to enter within the see of St Peter,
          they indignantly declined, and predicted the <q>destruction
          of popery</q>. In the West, however, from
          the 9th century down to the close of the 15th,
          Rome and the pope had been omnipotent ; and
          from the chair of St Peter radiated to the ends of
          Christendom a sovereignty vaster, more potent and
          awful than the old <q>mistress of the world</q> had
          ever wielded - a sovereignty to which the dogmas,
          ceremonies, and institutions of the Roman Church
          were admirably consonant. All our readers are
          familiar with Martin Luther and the work of
          reformation which he originated, its bold and
          rapid spread, and its grand success in the intellectual,
          moral, and spiritual regeneration of
          Europe, and in the career of material progress on
          which the nations entered. The Protestant epoch
          in Germany is fixed in 1521 ; in Switzerland and
          Geneva, in 1535 ; in Sweden and Denmark, in
          1566; in England, in 1547; and in Scotland, in
          1560. Protestantism took a comparatively slight
          hold of France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and
          Italy ; and in these countries Romanism has an
          ascendency all but unchallenged. The Church of
          Rome still includes within its pale one half of
          Christendom, the other half being divided between
          the Greek Church and the various denominations
          of Protestants. One counterbalancing fact lies in
          the Protestantism of Britain and America - not to
          speak of Germany - the two nations that are first
          in the van of universal progress.<pb n="64"/>

                <head>THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF ENGLAND.</head>
                <p>In the middle of the 14th century, Wicliffe
          assailed the papal indulgences and transubstantiation,
          and generally began to disseminate in England
          those doctrines which, after his death, continued
          to leaven the country, and which, on the
          rupture of Henry VIII. with the pope, triumphed
          in the Anglican Reformation. In 1535, the English
          parliament passed an Act wholly abolishing the
          papal authority within the realm. The power of
          the king became supreme. Under the guidance
          and influence of Cromwell and Cranmer, Bibles
          were placed in the churches, the youth of the
          nation were taught the Creed, the Ten Commandments,
          and the Lord's Prayer ; images were removed
          from the altar ; and there were put forth,
          the Book of Homilies in 1540, the New Communion
          Service and Catechism in 1548, the first Book
          of Common Prayer in 1549, and in 1553 the Forty-two
          Articles, which were subsequently revised by
          Archbishop Parker, reduced to Thirty-nine, and
          agreed upon by the archbishops and bishops of
          both provinces and the whole clergy in the Convocation
          held at London in the 4th year of Elizabeth,
          1562. These Articles, along with the Book
          of Common Prayer, still constitute the authorised
          standards of the Church of England, which, as
          distinguished from Rome, rejects tradition as a
          rule of faith ; bases all her teachings on the Old
          and New Testaments ; recognises but two sacraments -
          Baptism and the Lord's Supper ; denies
          the doctrine of transubstantiation and the propitiatory
          sacrifice of the Mass ; forbids the adoration
          of the Virgin, saints, and angels, and the
          reverence of relics and images ; and repudiates
          the Roman doctrines of purgatory and the
          spiritual supremacy of the pope. - Since her institution
          as a church separate from Rome, the
          Anglican establishment has passed through several
          grave crises. Menaced by Popery on the one
          hand, and Puritanism on the other, each of which
          succeeded for a brief period in even suspending
          her corporate existence, the former under Queen
          Mary, the latter under Cromwell, she has also
          witnessed two important secessions from her
          pale - that of the Nonconformists in 1662, when
          2000 clergymen abandoned her connection rather
          than submit to the conditions of the Act of Uniformity,
          newly passed, which required unfeigned
          assent to all and everything contained in the
          Book of Common Prayer ; and, subsequently,
          owing to the prevalent religious torpor and inactivity,
          that of the numerous and influential body
          into which the Wesleyan Methodists have grown.</p>
                <p>In 1801, the Act of Union came into effect,
          which imited the Churches of England and Ireland
          in all matters of doctrine, worship, and discipline.
          The connection again ceased on the 1st of January
          1871, when the Episcopal Church of Ireland
          became disestablished by an act of the imperial
          legislature.</p>
                <p>Several serious controversies have taken place
          in the Church of England within the last forty
          years. The Tractarian movement, the Gorham controversy,
          the development of Broad Churchism,
          together with some recent decisions in the ecclesiastical
          courts, have agitated the Church, and
          somewhat affected her position. The Tractarian
          controversy was occasioned by some tracts which
          began to be published at Oxford in 1833, the
          object of which was to revive something of the
          spirit of Catholic antiquity, and reform the Church
          system in accordance with that design. The
          Gorham controversy originated in the refusal of
          the Bishop of Exeter to institute the Rev. Cornelius
          Gorham to the vicarage of Brampford-
          Speke, on the ground of his holding unsound
          views as to the efficacy of the sacrament of
          Baptism. The Court of Arches (1849) decided
          that baptismal regeneration is the doctrine of the
          Church of England. Mr Gorham appealed to the
          judicial committee of the Privy-council, which,
          while disclaiming jurisdiction in matters of faith,
          and giving no decision on the doctrinal questions
          involved, reversed the judgment of the Court of
          Arches, on the ground, that differences of opinion
          on various points left open are quite consistent
          both with the views of the framers of the Articles
          and with the prevalent custom in the Church of
          England.</p>
                <p>That Church is at present divided into three
          sections tolerably well defined - what are known
          as the High Church party, the Broad Church
          party, and the Evangelical or Low Church party.
          The High Church party insist on the authority of
          the Church and priesthood, the efficacy of sacraments
          when rightly received, the necessity of apostolical
          succession in the matter of orders, and in
          their general teaching they take the Prayer-book
          as the exponent of Scripture. They are scrupulous
          in observing the rubrics, and have done much to
          revive the practice of daily prayer in the churches
          and the observance of festivals. Order, unity,
          antiquity, and catholicity are what they profess to
          have in view. There have been numerous
          secessions from their ranks to Romanism, and
          a disposition has been manifested by some of
          their number to introduce into the Anglican
          Church the confessional, monasticism, and the
          objective presence in the sacrament of the
          Supper.</p>
                <p>The judgment given in favour of Bennet in the
          Supreme Court of Appeal (June 8, 1872), caused
          considerable agitation, under the impression that
          something very like transubstantiation is tolerated
          in the Church of England. The Broad Church
          party, including the Arnold School and the followers
          of Maurice, are distinguished by a more
          than customary liberalism in the interpretation of
          the Scriptures and the Church standards ; depreciate
          doctrinal teaching as well as, to some extent,
          the differences between Christianity and other
          systems of faith, culture, and morals ; and earnestly
          advocate the idea of a comprehensive national
          Church, embracing nearly every variety
          of belief and form of worship. The Evangelical
          or Low Church party occupy a position midway
          between the other two, and strongly maintain the
          distinguishing doctrines of the Reformation, and
          those views concerning the atonement, the Spirit's work,
          justification, &amp;c. which are ordinarily termed
          evangelical ; personal religion and direct personal<pb n="65"/>devotion to the Redeemer, in opposition to ritualism
          ; and the sanctifying and saving efficacy of a
          personal faith in Christ, in opposition to Broad
          Churchism.</p>
                <p>Convocation consists of two chambers, termed
          the Upper and Lower Houses. The Upper House
          is composed of the archbishop and the bishops
          of the province ; and the Lower House, of the
          clergy of the second order. Meetings of Convocation,
          long in abeyance, have been lately resumed,
          particularly in the province of Canterbury ; and
          among other things, Convocation has resolved on
          a new and revised translation of the Holy Scriptures,
          which is now being executed by a committee
          of their appointment, including distinguished and
          learned representatives from other leading Protestant
          Churches.</p>
                <p>The position of the Church of England as
          respects its Convocation is anomalous. As essentially
          interwoven with the state, the Church possesses
          no independent action ; its articles, liturgy,
          organisation as to benefices, &amp;c. are all regulated
          by parliament, while its discipline falls within
          the scope of the ecclesiastical courts, the affairs of
          which are carried on by laymen, being a class of
          tribunals apart from the ministering clergy. The
          Church, therefore, in its distinctive capacity, is left
          little to do in the way of jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The number of benefices in the Church of
          England, which has 2 archbishops and 26 bishops,
          is now about 13,000, and the clergy of all classes
          are estimated at 23,000. A large proportion of
          the church property is managed by the Ecclesiastical
          Commissioners, appointed in 1836, who pay
          fixed incomes to the prelates of from £15,000 (to
          the Archbishop of Canterbury) to £2000. The
          deans, numbering 30, have incomes of from £3000
          to £700, £1000 being the general average. The
          bishops are assisted by 71 archdeacons, who, for
          the most part, also hold other preferments, and
          who have under them 610 rural deans. The
          revenue from tithes received by the clergy is
          about £2,500,000, and the income from church
          property is about £5,000,000. The Church of
          England has over 50 bishops and about 2500
          clergy in the colonies. The amount contributed
          to missions by Church of England societies in
          1871 was £324,782.</p>
                <p>The Anglican Church embraces in her communion
          the Episcopal Churches of Ireland and
          Scotland, all the colonial Episcopal Churches,
          and the American Episcopal Church. All but
          the latter use the English Book of Common
          Prayer : in America, this has been slightly
          altered.</p>
                <p>The Act disestablishing the <hi rend="italic">Episcopal Church
          of Ireland</hi> came into operation on the 1st January
          1871. Existing interests were provided for. The
          private benefactions left to the church were retained
          to the amount of £500,000, together with
          the national historical edifices, including several
          venerable cathedrals. The government is exercised
          by the Irish Church Representative Body,
          which comprises the two archbishops and ten
          bishops, and 36 elected and twelve other members,
          for the greater part laymen. The number of benefices
          is 1548, and of curates 622. The Church
          population is about 683,295. There are two archbishops
          and ten bishops. The whole number of
          Episcopalians in English-speaking communities
          is estimated at 17,050,000.</p>

                <head>THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</head>
                <p>At the commencement of the 15th century,
          Scotland was involved in the errors and corruptions
          then prevalent throughout Christendom, and,
          in ignorance and immorality, the Scottish clergy
          were amongst the worst in Europe. The opinions
          of Huss and Wicliffe having found their way
          into the country, were taught in several places,
          particularly in the south-western counties, where
          the followers of the latter went under the name
          of the Lollards of Kyle. When, a century later,
          by means of intercourse with the continent, the
          views of Luther became known in Scotland, and
          produced an impression, deepened by the martyrdom
          of Patrick Hamilton and George Wishart,
          the persecution to which the recipients of the
          Reformed opinions were subjected by the bishops,
          aroused and fanned the spirit of independence
          inherent in the Scottish breast, so that, on the
          return of John Knox from Geneva, in 1559, he
          found a fitting soil in which to deposit the new
          seed, and a ready response in the hearts of the
          people to his bold projects. Encouraged by the
          strength of their party, the accession of Queen
          Elizabeth, and the return of Knox, the Reformed
          section of the nation - known as the <q>Congregation</q>
          - having triumphed in open warfare, obtained
          a complete ascendency in the parliament
          that met at Edinburgh in 1560, which passed
          several acts, abolishing the jurisdiction of the
          pope, proscribing the Mass, and ratifying a Confession
          of Faith, drawn up by Knox and his
          associates. This Confession embraced all the
          essential articles in the ancient creeds, and though
          substantially the same as that afterwards compiled
          at Westminster, was considerably more
          liberal. The First Book of Discipline followed,
          setting forth the government and discipline of
          the Church. Three principal orders of office-bearers
          were established - ministers, elders, and
          deacons - chosen by the several congregations,
          and publicly ordained by the ministers and elders
          of the Church. A temporary order of superintendents,
          having power to plant churches and
          appoint ministers, was instituted. The legislation
          and judicial power was vested in a General
          Assembly, which met once or twice in the year,
          and which consisted of ministers, superintendents,
          and representative elders. A simple form of worship
          was adopted, and the Sabbath only set apart
          for religious services.</p>
                <p>On the accession of James VI. to the throne
          of England, he conceived a strong predilection
          for that form of religion which he found existing
          in the southern part of the island, with a correspondingly
          violent antipathy to Presbyterianism ;
          and he endeavoured by various means to effect a
          change in Scotland. The attempt to revive prelacy
          succeeded for a short time. Bishops were
          again promoted to the several sees. But a new
          struggle, headed by Andrew Melville, the disciple
          of Beza, ended in the adoption by the General
          Assembly (1581) of a still more stringent system
          of Presbyterianism, embodied in the Second Book
          of Discipline. Charles I. endeavoured to introduce
          into the Scottish Church a Book of Canons
          and a Liturgy framed on the model of those of
          England ; but the popular indignation, which
          found vent in the National Covenant, presented<pb n="66"/>an effectual barrier, and brought about the total
          abolition of Episcopacy. Fearful of the re-introduction
          of popery, the great body of the nation
          made common cause with the parliament of England
          in withstanding the policy of Charles I., and,
          by a combined hostility to popery, aimed at
          securing a uniformity of Protestant religion and
          worship throughout the kingdom ; a design which
          formed the <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre</hi> of the Assembly that
          met at Westminster in 1643. This body, composed
          for the most part of Englishmen, but
          with delegates from the Scottish Church, elaborated
          that Confession of Faith and those other
          documents which form the standards of the
          Church of Scotland, and of the different Presbyterian
          Churches in Great Britain, the United
          States of America, and the British colonies, to
          the present day. This Confession constitutes the
          most formal expression of Augustinian and Calvinistic
          doctrines in existence. With the restoration
          of the monarchy under Charles II. came the
          attempted restoration, once more, of Episcopacy
          in Scotland. But the national conscience could
          not be coerced. On the accession of William and
          Mary, prelacy was abolished, and Presbyterianism
          re-established, the Westminster Confession ratified,
          and patronage done away. At the close of 1690,
          a General Assembly was held, composed, as
          before, of ministers and elders from the various
          presbyteries, presided over by a minister elected
          by the members, as Moderator, and having the
          presence of a lay commissioner, representing the
          crown. With the exception of some years in the
          reign of William, the Assembly has continued to
          meet annually ever since, and to transact business,
          when not in session, by a Commission named
          by itself for the purpose. At the union of England
          and Scotland in 1707, a special statute was
          passed for the security of the Protestant religion
          and Presbyterian form of church government in
          the latter country.</p>
                <p>The most important controversy which has
          agitated the Church of Scotland is that which
          relates to patronage. In 1712, an Act was passed
          by the British parliament which restored to
          patrons in Scotland the right of presentation to
          benefices. This Act caused great discontent at the
          time, and it has occasioned several considerable
          secessions from the Established Church of Scotland,
          the principal being the Disruption of 1843.
          In 1834, under the influence of Chalmers, the
          <q>Veto Act</q>, giving the people the right of rejection,
          though not of call, was passed by the General
          Assembly. The Court of Session refused to
          homologate - this Act, and subsequent collisions
          between the civil and ecclesiastical courts led to
          the Disruption of 1843.</p>
                <p>Of late years, the law of patronage, though
          seldom enforced, yet alongside of popular elections
          in the other Presbyterian Churches of the country,
          and in those churches, now amounting to a large
          proportion of its best charges, built by its own
          members, has put the Established Church to
          serious inconvenience. By a recent decision of
          the General Assembly, that Church resolved to
          seek its repeal. A bill with that object was introduced
          into the House of Lords on May 18, 1874,
          This bill vests the election of ministers in the
          communicants - and adherents of the parish church.
          The number of ministers in the Established
          Church is about 1300, and the number of churches
          1250. The amount raised by the Church for her
          various objects, as reported to the General Assembly
          of 1874, for the previous year, was £278,488,
          exclusive of a munificent donation of half a
          million by Mr Baird of Auchmeddan. Within the
          last 20 years, 150 churches have been endowed,
          at a cost of £500,000.</p>

                <head>THE SCOTTISH EPISCOPAL CHURCH.</head>
                <p>At the Revolution Settlement, the leading Episcopal
          clergy, and, on the death of Queen Anne,
          both clergy and laity, in Scotland were Jacobites ;
          a fact which, in addition to the general recollection
          of the mode in which the Stuarts sought
          to force prelacy upon the country, was unfavourable
          to Scottish Episcopacy. The succession of
          bishops was, however, kept up by new consecrations.
          Liturgical forms similar to, and generally
          identical with, those in the English Prayer-book
          were introduced. Though the Episcopalians took
          no open part in the insurrection of 1745, as they
          did in that of 1715, yet their sympathies were
          known to be with the House of Stuart, and the
          government carried through parliament some acts
          which had the effect of suppressing public worship in
          the Episcopal communion for many years. On
          the accession of George III. these statutes ceased
          to be enforced ; but they were only repealed in
          1792. The Act which gave this relief imposed
          restrictions on their clergy officiating in England,
          and prohibited their holding benefices in the
          English Church. In 1804, the Thirty-nine Articles,
          and in 1863, the Prayer-book, of the Church of
          England were adopted by the Scottish Episcopal
          Church. The restrictions imposed by the Act of
          1792 were modified by an Act passed in 1840; and
          in 1864 they were entirely removed, with the
          reservation of the right to bishops in England and
          Ireland to refuse institution to a Scottish clergyman
          on his first presentation to a benefice, but
          not after he should have once held such benefice.
          The dioceses of the Scottish Episcopal Church
          are : Moray, Aberdeen, Brechin, Argyll, St
          Andrews, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. The bishops
          are chosen by the clergy of the diocese, and by
          representatives of the lay communicants. One of
          the bishops, under the name of Primus, chosen
          by the other bishops, presides at all meetings of
          the bishops, and has certain other privileges, but
          possesses no metropolitan authority. The highest
          judicial body is the Episcopal College, composed
          of all the bishops. The highest legislative body
          is a General Synod, composed of two houses, the
          one of the bishops, and the other of the deans and
          the representatives of the clergy. The number of
          churches in the Scottish Episcopal Church is 178 ;
          and of clergy, 196.</p>

                <head>THE FREE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.</head>
                <p>The standards and Presbyterian constitution of
          the Free Church do not differ from those of the
          Established Church. In both, government is by
          Kirk-sessions, Presbyteries, Synods, and General
          Assembly, ascending in regular gradation, the
          higher court having the right of review in cases of
          appeal, and the legislative power residing in the
          supreme court, or General Assembly. All the
          laws in force prior to the Disruption are acknowledged
          by the Free Church, except in so far as they<pb n="67"/>have since been repealed. There is, however, a
          not inconsiderable difference of opinion in these
          two Churches respecting the interpretation of their
          common standards as bearing on the doctrine of
          the province of the civil magistrate in religious
          affairs. While both are agreed in asserting,
          generally, the headship of Christ and the coordinate
          jurisdiction of church and state, as
          these are embodied in the standards, the Free
          Church maintains that the existing relations of
          church and state, in the case of the Establishment,
          are inconsistent with the perfect freedom of
          the Church in the conduct and management of its
          own affairs. The legislative and administrative
          freedom of the Church regarding spiritual matters,
          and the people's right of call, were the main
          elements of dispute in the <q>Ten Years' Conflict</q>,
          which terminated in the formation of the Free
          Church. It is held by Free Churchmen that in
          the enforcement of the rights given to patrons by
          the Act passed in 1712, when Jacobite counsels
          prevailed in the court of Queen Anne, during the
          18th century, and a considerable part of the
          19th, no direct invasion of the ecclesiastical
          province took place on the part of the civil courts
          and of the civil power ; the presentation of the
          patron was regarded as simply conveying a civil
          right to the benefice or emoluments ; and that the
          Court of Session, <hi rend="italic">in requiring ecclesiastical action
          to follow presentation</hi>, took new ground, tantamount
          to an unwarrantable interference with the
          liberty of the Church. In August 1842, the
          House of Lords affirmed a decree of the Court
          of Session, which required the presbytery of
          Auchterarder to take the ordinary steps towards
          the settlement of the presentee to Auchterarder,
          without regard to the dissent of the parishioners.
          An application to parliament, in the form of a
          <q>Claim of Right</q> from the evangelical majority
          for an Act such as would have reconciled the
          duties of their position according to the law of the
          land, in the Church by law established, with what
          they believed to be their duty towards Christ and
          according to His law, was rejected ; and it now
          seemed to them that the only course open was to
          retire from their position by the sacrifice of the
          emoluments and benefits of an establishment.
          Accordingly, in 1843, 474 ministers renounced
          their connection with the Establishment, and
          along with them a great body of its elders and
          members.</p>
                <p>The Free Church forthwith addressed itself to
          the important work of organisation. An immense
          enthusiasm pervaded its members, by whose
          unprecedented liberality a Sustentation Fund, furnishing
          an equal dividend to all the ministers of
          the Church, was successfully launched ; churches
          and manses were erected in all parts of Scotland ;
          the support of all the missionaries who had belonged
          to the Church of Scotland, and who now
          joined the Free Church, was undertaken from the
          first ; and when it was found that the question
          affected the position of parish schoolmasters, an
          <q>Education Scheme</q> was framed and carried out.
          Colleges for the training of ministers were founded
          in the cities of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow.
          The Free Church movement reacting upon
          the Establishment, and profoundly influencing
          other churches both at home and abroad, lent an
          immense impetus to the work of church extension
          in Scotland, as well as to evangelistic and missionary
          enterprise in other countries. The movement
          affected the colonial no less than the missionary
          field, though, in this case, not with like
          results. The divisions which it wrought in the
          colonies have, however, since been almost entirely
          healed. The Presbyterians of the colony of
          Victoria realising that in their new circumstances
          the Scottish differences occasioned by state connection
          had no practical bearing on their case,
          took the initiative in union, the advantages of
          which soon became so obvious, that various
          Presbyterian bodies in the other colonies have
          since formed united churches. An effort to bring
          about a union between the Free Church and the
          United Presbyterian Church of late, failed through
          the opposition of a minority in the Free Church.</p>
                <p>In the first year of the Disruption, the sum of
          £367,000 was raised by the Free Church, whose
          Sustentation Fund now amounts to £152,112 a
          year. The total sums raised for the various
          objects of the Free Church of Scotland, for the
          year ending 31st March 1874, amounted to
          £511,000. The equal dividend is £150 a year,
          the number of ministers who receive it being 826.
          Of these, 600 also share in a general surplus fund.
          The whole number of ministers is upwards of 937,
          and the congregations number more than 954.</p>

                <head>UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.</head>
                <p>The United Presbyterian Church, one of the
          three larger religious denominations in Scotland,
          was constituted in 1847 by the amalgamation of
          the Secession and Relief Churches.</p>
                <p>The Secession Church was the earliest outcome
          of dissatisfaction in the Church of Scotland
          with what was regarded by the Covenanting
          element within its pale as those compromises
          attendant on the Revolution, by which, for example,
          hundreds of Episcopalian curates were
          allowed to retain their parishes, in which they
          had been stationed, on subscribing the Confession
          of Faith ; and great numbers of laymen
          became office-bearers in a church whose strict
          adherents they had but lately hunted to death.
          The enforcement of the law of patronage was
          the occasion of the secession of Ebenezer
          Erskine and a few other ministers, who, by means
          of little Christian societies, which were everywhere
          formed, and gradually supplied with pastors,
          succeeded in making an impression on the religious
          life of the country. In 1747, the small but
          increasing body divided on the question of the
          consistency of a Seceder taking the burgess-oath,
          the party condemning the religious clause constituting
          the <hi rend="italic">General Associate Synod</hi>, or, popularly,
          the <hi rend="italic">Anti-burgher Synod</hi>; the party tolerating it,
          the <hi rend="italic">Associate</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Burgher Synod</hi>. Each of these
          was subsequently divided, and two other trivial denominations
          were formed, the <hi rend="italic">Old Anti-burghers</hi>
          (1806) and <hi rend="italic">Old Light Burghers</hi> (1799). The
          Burghers and Anti-burghers were again united in
          1820, when their congregations, which numbered
          32 at the breach (1747), amounted to 262. The
          chief controversies in which the Secession Church
          was engaged are the <hi rend="italic">Voluntary Controversy</hi>,
          conducted with leading divines of the Established
          Church (1829-1834), and the <hi rend="italiv">Atonement Controversy</hi>.
          At the date of union with the Relief
          Church in 1847, the Secession had a staff of 60
          missionaries.</p>
                <pb n="68"/>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Relief Church</hi> was founded by Thomas
          Gillespie, who, having signalised himself in refusing
          to proceed with a settlement obnoxious
          to the people, was, in consequence, deposed by
          the General Assembly. Joined by Mr Thomas
          Boston, son of the great Boston, in 1758, and by
          the congregation of Colinsburgh in 1761, the
          Relief body grew pretty much after the manner of
          the Secession ; but holding the principle of <q>free
          communion</q>, the party was for a long time
          fiercely assailed by the Seceders and Reformed
          Presbyterians.</p>
                <p>At the union in 1847, the Relief numbered 113,
          and the Secession 384 congregations. The United
          Presbyterian Church, thus commencing with 497
          churches and 140,000 members, has had a career
          of great prosperity. It adheres to the Westminster
          standards, with the modification - <q>it being
          always understood, that we do not approve of
          anything in these documents which teaches, or
          may be supposed to teach, compulsory, or persecuting,
          and intolerant principles in religion.</q>
          The supreme court is called a Synod ; and the
          body has a Theological Hall and Library in
          Edinburgh, and a staff of professors. The system
          of training is, however, somewhat different
          from that of the Established and Free Churches.
          The distinguishing characteristic of the United
          Presbyterian Church at present, as compared with
          other Presbyterian Churches, is its voluntaryism,
          according to which it is held that the interests
          of Christianity are best subserved by the total
          separation of the Church from the state.</p>
                <p>The United Presbyterian Church has upwards
          of 611 churches and of 601 ministers. In the
          year ending May 1873, the sum of £325,000 was
          raised by this body for its different religious purposes.</p>

            <div>
                <head>REFORMED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.</head>
                <p>This Church was formed after the Revolution by
          a small party of Presbyterians who objected to
          the settlement then made in church and state, and
          holding to the binding obligation of the Solemn
          League and Covenant, advocated the civil and
          ecclesiastical polity that prevailed in Scotland
          from 1638 to 1649, and became popularly known
          as Cameronians, or followers of Richard Cameron.
          For 16 years they remained without any minister ;
          and it was not till 1743 that their first presbytery,
          with three ministers, was formed. In 1712, the
          members of the body renewed the Covenants ; a
          mode of confirming their faith which they have
          employed from time to time. In the recent union
          negotiations, the Reformed Presbyterian Church
          has shewn itself more liberal than was generally
          imagined, having expressed its satisfaction with
          the articles of union.</p>
                <p>The Reformed Presbyterian Church has 44
          churches and 40 ministers in Scotland ; and under
          a different jurisdiction, but with the same principles,
          32 churches and 32 ministers in Ireland.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>The Presbyterianism existing in England and
          Ireland is also of Scottish origin, rather than
          indigenous to either of the other countries. The
          successors of the numerous Presbyterians in England
          at the time of the Westminster Assembly
          adopted Unitarian sentiments. At present, there
          are three Presbyterian Churches represented in
          England, all of Scottish planting ; that branch,
          numbering 20 churches, 20 ministers, and 10
          chaplains, connected with the Established Church
          of Scotland ; the <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian Church in England</hi>,
          having 132 churches and 130 ministers, which,
          though possessed of self-government, formerly
          stood in special relations to the Free Church of
          Scotland ; and that branch, nearly as numerous,
          connected with the United Presbyterian Church.
          The Presbyterian Church in England has a
          college in London, and 8 presbyteries, of which
          those of Lancashire and London are the principal.
          A union between this body and the portion of
          the United Presbyterian Church in England, both
          of which have made signal progress in England
          (150 per cent.) during the last 20 years, was
          attempted, but failed in consequence of an adverse
          decision of the United Presbyterian Synod (1874).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian Church in Ireland</hi> is a selfgoverned
          body, entirely similar to the leading
          Presbyterian Churches in Scotland, with 560
          congregations, 628 ministers, and 123,000 communicants.
          Formerly in the possession of a grant
          from the state, called the <hi rend="italic">regium donum</hi>, it has
          now a Sustentation Fund, and during the year
          ending May 1873, raised for all purposes £125,419.</p>

                <head>EVANGELICAL UNION.</head>
                <p>This body, otherwise called Morisonians, was
          constituted in Scotland in 1843, by the Rev.
          James Morison of Kilmarnock and other ministers
          (whose doctrinal views had been condemned by
          the Secession Church, to which they belonged),
          and by the congregations adhering to them.
          They were soon afterwards joined by a number
          of ministers and congregations, holding like
          religious views, that previously belonged to the
          Congregational Union. Their doctrinal opinions
          are highly Pelagian and Arminian. They hold
          that Christ died for all men equally, that all have
          equal grace and ability to believe the gospel, &amp;c.
          Their church government is independent, and their
          number is 10,000.</p>

                <head>GLASSITES.</head>
                <p>This sect arose in Scotland in 1730, when John
          Glas, a minister near Dundee, was deposed by
          the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland,
          on account of views contrary to the standards of
          the Church. He maintained that all national
          establishments of religion are inconsistent with
          the true nature of the Church of Christ, and that
          faith is <q>a bare belief of the bare truth</q>. A
          number of small congregations were soon formed
          on Glassite principles, in Scotland, England, and
          America, which were better known as Sandemanians,
          from a follower of Glas, Robert Sandeman.
          Their number has diminished greatly of
          late years, although their religious views continue
          to be disseminated under other names. In 1851,
          there were only six Glassite churches in Scotland,<pb n="69"/>none of which contained very many members, and
          six Sandemanian churches in England. They
          deem it unlawful to join in prayer with any one
          who is not a brother or sister in Christ, they
          observe the Lord's Supper weekly, maintain <hi rend="italic">love-feasts</hi>,
          and, in general, hold by the most literal
          interpretation of Scripture rules.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bereans</hi> were so named from the prominence
          given by them to the Bible alone in
          religious matters, in allusion to Acts xvii. 11. The
          founder of the Bereans was the Rev. John Barclay,
          a native of Perthshire (1734-1798). The sect is
          now almost extinct.</p>

            <div>
                <head>INDEPENDENTS.</head>
                <p>The Independents or Congregationalists, as a
          distinctive denomination, were founded in England
          by Robert Brown about the year 1583.
          Their distinguishing tenets relate to church
          government, on which they are opposed both to
          the Presbyterian and Episcopalian forms, and
          may be regarded as standing at the farthest
          remove consistent with corporate existence from
          that system of organisation which has found its
          fullest embodiment in Romanism. The essential
          element of Congregationalism is, that any community
          or congregation of Christians has a right
          to the regulation of its own ecclesiastical discipline
          and form of worship, independent of any other
          community ; each congregation forming in itself
          a Church, a word which, it is held by Independents,
          is always employed in the Bible to signify
          either a single congregation or its place of meeting,
          the aggregate of Christian communities
          being, according to them, denoted by the plural
          <q>churches</q>. They require not only intellectual
          assent to the historical narrative of Christianity,
          but personal religion in those who are admitted
          to a congregation. Any man whom a congregation
          may think qualified to edify them is eligible
          for the ministry. Ordination, which is considered
          merely an affair of order, is performed by
          the ministers of neighbouring churches. Independents
          hold that the Church is a purely spiritual
          institution, and has no head but Christ. Forming
          a minority of 5 out of the 70 or 80 members who
          composed the Westminster Assembly, the Independents,
          who were backed by the influence of
          Cromwell, held a great meeting in 1658, at which
          a declaration was drawn up precisely the same as
          that of the Westminster Assembly, except that
          the chapter in favour of the Presbyterian form
          of church government was omitted, and another
          substituted in favour of Congregationalism. Along
          with other Nonconformists, the Independents
          suffered greatly by the passing of the Act of
          Uniformity in 1662. The Revolution and the Act
          of Toleration (1689) brought them relief. Attempts
          at union between them and the Presbyterians
          followed, and in 1691 heads of agreement were
          drawn up. At length, in 1730, Presbyterians,
          Baptists, and Independents were united under
          the name of the Three Denominations, which
          held conferences, ultimately disturbed by the withdrawal
          of the Presbyterians. Considerable accessions
          were made to the Independents through the
          religious movements determined by the Wesleys
          and Whitefield ; it now forms, next to the
          Wesleyan Methodists, the largest dissenting body
          in England, and it is also numerous in America.
          Besides the illustrious Protector, the Independents
          can boast of such names as Owen, Pye Smith,
          John Angell James, and Raffles.</p>
                <p>Independency established itself in Scotland towards
          the close of last century, under the influence
          of Haldane, who, along with Aikman, made a
          preaching tour as far north as the Orkney Islands.
          Other itinerant preachers followed ; and between
          1798 and 1807, 85 churches were formed, and
          pastors ordained. A controversy on the <hi rend="italic">elder's
          office</hi> seriously impeded and weakened the Congregational
          cause for a time, but the formation, in
          1811, of the Glasgow Theological Academy (now
          removed to Edinburgh) did much to restore its
          vigour.</p>
                <p>In America, the progress of the Independent
          body - founded at Plymouth, New England, by
          John Robinson in 1620 - was temporarily marked
          by the spread of Antinomian and Unitarian
          doctrines. Antinomianism was condemned by a
          synod convened in New England. In 1785, a
          separation took place between the Unitarian and
          Trinitarian Congregationalists. Harvard College
          is Unitarian. '<quote>Congregationalism</quote>', according to
          <bibl>

                    </bibl>, '<quote>is the ruling sect of the six northeastern
          states.</quote>'</p>
                <p>The Independents require no subscription to any
          human standard of doctrine, and yet there exists,
          on the whole, very considerable harmony in their
          teaching, which is in the main orthodox and Calvinistic.
          It might, at first sight, appear likely that
          the perfect independence of each congregation
          would render their working together harmoniously
          a matter of great difficulty ; but experience has
          shewn the contrary. No great secessions have at
          any time taken place from their ranks, and there
          is a striking agreement between their modern
          faith and principles and those which were recognised
          at the first rise of their system. The <q>Congregational
          Union of England and Wales</q> was
          formed in 1831, and consists of a Conference of
          delegates, lay and clerical, from the various
          churches, who assemble twice a year for consultation
          upon general Church affairs, and to unite in
          such combined exertions as will not interfere with
          their principles. It is distinctively provided, however,
          in the constitution of this Conference, that
          it shall never become a court of appeal. In some
          parts of America, the Independents have permanent
          assemblies, termed 'advisory bodies,' for
          the purpose of taking into consideration, and
          giving counsel on, cases of difficulty submitted to
          them. The question of the desirableness of a
          greater approximation to the Presbyterian system
          was brought before the English Conference a few
          years ago, but without any positive result in that
          direction.</p>
                <p>The Congregational Union numbers 78 associations
          at home and in the colonies, with 3609
          churches, and 2716 ministers and missionaries.
          It has been estimated that there are 7 million
          Congregationalists in all English-speaking communities.</p>

                <head>METHODISTS.</head>
                <p>Originally applied by a student of Christ-Church
          to the brothers Wesley, and several other young
          men, then members of the different colleges of<pb n="70"/>Oxford, who were in the habit of assembling
          together on particular nights of the week chiefly
          for religious conversation, the term Methodist
          was selected in allusion to the exact and methodical
          manner in which they performed the various
          engagements which a sense of Christian duty
          induced them to undertake, such as meeting
          together for the purpose of studying Scripture,
          visiting the poor, and prisoners in Oxford jail, at
          <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> intervals. Subsequently, it came to be
          applied to the followers of Wesley and his coadjutors,
          when these had acquired the magnitude of
          a new sect. In 1735, John Wesley was induced
          to go out to Georgia with General Oglethorpe, to
          preach to the Indians and colonists. His intercourse
          with Moravians, who were his fellow-passengers
          to America, and afterwards his fellow-labourers
          in the colony, tended to stimulate his
          religious zeal. Having returned to England in
          about two years, he maintained an intimate connection
          with the Moravians in London, and on
          May 24, 1738, at a meeting of a Society in Aldersgate
          Street, he experienced such a change, that,
          notwithstanding all his previous zeal, he ever
          afterwards regarded this as the time of his conversion.
          After visiting the Moravian Brethren in
          Germany for a short time, he became associated
          with his former college-companion, Whitefield,
          and following his example, commenced, in 1739,
          the practice of open-air preaching. In 1740, he
          separated himself from the Moravians. In the
          course of Wesley's endeavours to initiate and
          carry on an efficient scheme of evangelisation,
          that system of Methodism was developed, which,
          though like some other important schemes, extemporised
          to suit the occasion and the exigences
          of existing circumstances, exhibits a theoretically
          complete and masterly organisation. By-and-by,
          <q>societies</q>, consisting of persons anxious to know
          about salvation, were formed in different parts of
          England, where the evangelistic labours of the
          Wesleys had awakened in many minds <q>a desire
          to flee from the wrath to come, and be saved
          from their sins</q> - the only condition required of
          any for admission into these societies, which
          Wesley subdivided into classes, under the superintendence
          of leaders, whose duties were partly
          religious and partly financial. For preaching purposes,
          the societies were aggregated into <q>circuits</q>,
          each circuit now generally including a town, and
          a rural circle of ten or fifteen miles, and having
          two, three, or four ministers appointed to it, one
          of whom is styled the <q>superintendent</q>. Here
          they labour for at least one year, and not more
          than three. Still larger associations are the <q>districts</q>,
          composed of from ten to twenty circuits.
          General <q>circuit meetings</q>, composed of ministers,
          stewards, leaders of classes, lay preachers, &amp;c. are
          held quarterly, and <q>district meetings</q> once a year.
          The supreme Methodist assembly is the <q>Conference</q>,
          which is exclusively clerical, and which now
          consists of 100 ministers, mostly seniors, who hold
          their office according to arrangements prescribed
          in a Deed of Declaration executed by John Wesley
          himself, and enrolled in Chancery. But the representatives
          elected at the district meetings sit
          and vote usually as one body, the 100 confirming
          their decisions.</p>
                <p>Wesleyan Methodists claim to be considered
          <hi rend="italic">orthodox, Protestant</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">evangelical</hi>. They
          accept the <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> of the English Church, but
          believing these Articles to have been framed on a
          basis of <hi rend="italic">comprehension</hi>, they consider themselves
          at liberty to accept them in an Arminian sense.
          They are not, however, out-and-out Arminians.
          While rejecting the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination,
          which they conceive to be incompatible
          with the universality of the atonement,
          as held by them, they maintain the total fall of
          man in Adam, and his utter inability to recover
          himself. They give prominence to the necessity
          of men who profess to be Christians feeling a
          <hi rend="italic">personal interest</hi> in the blessings of salvation, or
          assurance by the Spirit of <hi rend="italic">present pardon</hi>, and
          hold in a modified form the perfectibility of
          Christians in the present life, but reject the doctrine
          of the necessary perseverance of the saints.
          In their religious services, the Wesleyan Methodists
          use more or less the English liturgy. They
          observe a <q>watch-night</q> on the eve of the New
          Year ; and at the beginning of the year, they hold
          a <q>covenant service</q>, at which congregations
          solemnly vow to serve the Lord. But even the
          ordinary religious services, in some places, are
          frequently marked by an ebullition of fervent feeling
          on the part of the audience, which has a very
          singular effect upon a stranger.</p>
                <p>The success of Wesleyan Methodism has been
          very great, whether looked at as a vast <q>home
          mission</q>, as originally intended, or in its foreign
          missionary enterprise. When Wesley died (1791),
          his <q>societies</q> had spread over the United Kingdom,
          the continent of Europe, the States of
          America, and the West Indies, and numbered
          80,000 members. Since then, they have largely
          increased, and, according to the latest returns,
          about 13 millions of people, including Sunday
          scholars, are under Methodist influence and
          teaching in all parts of the world : the membership
          being 2,900,000.</p>
                <p>The Wesleyan Methodists first established
          themselves as a religious society in the United
          States of America in 1766, under the name of
          the Methodist Episcopal Church, which, at the
          termination of the revolutionary struggle, numbered
          43 preachers and 13,740 members. Up to
          this time, the American Wesleyan Methodists laid
          no claim to being a distinct religious organisation.
          But the American revolution rendered the
          foundation of an independent society inevitable ;
          whereupon, Wesley, who considered that, in the
          primitive church, a presbyter and a bishop were one
          and the same order, differing only as to their
          official functions, assumed the office of the latter,
          and set apart and ordained as bishop of the
          infant church the Rev. Thomas Coke, D.C.L.
          September 2, 1784, who was unanimously recognised
          by the Conference held at Baltimore in
          the December following. In 1830, a secession
          took place, comprising those who were dissatisfied
          with the Episcopal form of government, by whom
          a new organisation was formed, called the Methodist
          Protestant Church, whose numbers at the
          seventh general Conference (1858) amounted to
          90,000 members and 2000 preachers. Two other
          secessions took place on the question of slavery :
          one in 1842, resulting in the formation at New
          York, in 1843, of the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Connection
          of America</hi>, whose members in 1858
          amounted to 20,000, and its preachers to 300 ; and
          another in 1844, originating the <hi rend="italic">Methodist Episcopal
          Church, South</hi>, which in 1859 had 2661<pb n="71"/>travelling preachers, 5177 local preachers ; 511,601
          white members ; 197,848 coloured members.</p>
                <p>Various secessions from the Methodist body in
        England have also taken place.</p>
                <p>In 1797, was formed the METHODIST NEW
          CONNECTION, which differs from the older body
          in admitting one layman to each minister into
          the Conference, and to a full share of all its business,
          spiritual and secular. These laymen are
          chosen either by the circuits, or by <q>guardian
          representatives</q>, elected for life by the Conference.
          The PRIMITIVE METHODISTS were formed into a
          society in 1810, the causes of separation being
          a disagreement as to the propriety of camp-meetings
          for religious purposes, the question of
          females being permitted to preach, and the difference
          as to the admission to the Conference of
          lay members. The UNITED FREE CHURCH
          METHODISTS were formed by the amalgamation
          of the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Association</hi>, originated in 1834,
          and the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Reform Association</hi>, which
          began in 1849. Church independency, and freedom
          of representation in the annual assembly, are
          two of the most prominent distinctive traits in
          the organisation of the United Methodist Free
          Church.</p>
                <p>The WELSH CALVINISTIC METHODISTS originated
          partly in the preaching of Whitefield, and
          partly in that of Howel Harris, a Welsh clergyman
          of the Church of England. Whitefield and
          Wesley differed on the subject of election. Whitefield
          did not form a religious sect, and after his
          death (1769), a large portion of his followers
          became absorbed in the new society, gradually
          forming itself through the preaching of Howel
          Harris and his coadjutors. This body, however,
          was not formally constituted a religious society
          till the beginning of this century. Its government
          is Presbyterian. The adults as well as children
          attend their Sunday schools ; and they have an
          extensive periodical literature. - The <hi rend="italic">Bible Christians</hi>,
          or Bryanites, were formed by a local
          preacher named Bryan, who seceded from the
          Wesleyans in 1815. The only distinction between
          them and the original body appears to be that
          the former receive the eucharistic elements in a
          sitting posture.</p>

            <div>
                <head>BAPTISTS.</head>
                <p>This denomination of Christians, sometimes
          called Antipaedists, as opposed to Paedobaptists,
          or those who advocate infant baptism, refuse to
          acknowledge any great name as founder of their
          sect. They trace their origin to the primitive
          Church itself, and refer to the Acts of the Apostles
          and their Epistles as affording, in their opinion,
          evidence in favour of their distinguishing tenets.
          When Christianity became corrupted, they point
          to the maintenance of their practice among the
          Cathari and Albigenses, and other sects of the
          middle ages, who continued, amid surrounding
          darkness, to hold fast the apostolic testimony.
          They sprung into notice in England under Henry
          VIII. and Elizabeth. They were persecuted under
          both reigns, but they received freedom to meet
          for worship from James II., and complete religious
          liberty under William III. Ever since, they
          have diffused their principles in Great Britain
          and America.</p>
                <p>The Baptists generally hold the usual orthodox
          beliefs, along with some differences. Thus, they
          have among them Calvinists both <hi rend="italic">hyper</hi> and
          moderate, as well as High and Low Arminians.
          The great body of them in Britain and America
          are Calvinistic. <hi rend="italic">Particular</hi> Baptists, so called
          because holding that Christ died for an elect
          number ; and <hi rend="italic">General</hi> Baptists, who maintain that
          he died for all men, constitute the two leading
          sects into which the body is divided. <hi rend="italic">English</hi>
          Baptists, in their church order and government,
          are the same as Congregationalists, the rite of
          baptism excepted. <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> Baptists, properly so
          called, insist on a plurality of pastors in every
          church, and the exercise of mutual exhortation
          by the members in their public assemblies. There
          are Baptist churches in England, however, who
          are <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> in their order, and English Baptists
          in Scotland who are <hi rend="italic">English</hi> in theirs. Seventh-day
          Baptists, we believe, are to be found almost
          wholly in America, who observe not the first day
          of the week, but the seventh, as the day of rest.</p>
                <p>Baptists are distinguished among their fellow-Christians by holding that baptism, being an
          ordinance the validity of which depends on an
          intelligent faith on the part of the recipient, is to
          be administered to those who are capable of
          exercising faith, and by <hi rend="italic">immersion</hi> only. Its
          <hi rend="italic">subjects</hi>, therefore, are actual believers in the
          Lord Jesus Christ - adults, not infants ; and its
          <hi rend="italic">mode</hi> is immersion, not sprinkling. The Baptists
          are divided among themselves regarding communion - 
          one portion receiving conscientious
          Paedobaptists to the Lord's table and membership
          ; the other refusing this privilege to any but
          Baptists. The churches of the former are called
          open communionists ; the latter, strict communionists.</p>
                <p>The Baptists were early in the field of missions.
          They have been honoured to plant Christian
          churches in many parts of continental India, in
          Ceylon, in the Bahamas, the West Indies, Africa,
          and China. They have now schools of learning
          for training candidates for the ministry at Bristol,
          Bradford, London, Nottingham, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Congregational in their form of church government,
          the Baptists are grouped generally in associations
          of churches, the greater number of
          them belonging to the Baptist Union, formed in
          1832. In England and Wales, the associations
          number 53, the ministers 2000, and the members
          241,764. There are supposed to be 8,500,000
          Baptists of all descriptions in English-speaking
          communities.</p>

            <div>
                <head>UNITARIANS.</head>
                <p>Applied generally to all who maintain that
          God exists in one person only, the term Unitarians
          is used specially to designate a small
          Christian sect of recent times, whose distinguishing
          tenet is the Unity as opposed to the Trinity
          of the Godhead. Their particular doctrine was
          held substantially from the middle of the 2d century
          to the end of the 3d by the Monarchians ; in
          the 4th century by Arius and his followers, who
          denied the consubstantiality of the Son with the
          Father ; after the Reformation, by the Socini and
          others, through whom it was largely diffused in
          Venetia, Poland, and Transylvania. During the
          reign of James I. continental Socinianism began
          to exercise considerable influence in England, and
          continued to do so till the end of the century;
          but it was in the last decade of the 17th century<pb n="72"/>that the controversy was most active. After the
          passing of the Toleration Act in 1689, whereby
          Nonconformity was made legal, the way was prepared
          for that gradual change by which the orthodoxy
          of the English Presbyterians passed into
          Unitarianism. During the latter half of the 18th
          century, Priestley appeared as the champion of
          the humanitarian view of Christ's nature ; and in
          1744, Dr Lindsey resigned his charge in the
          Church of England, and became pastor of the
          Unitarian congregation of Essex Street, London -
          an event which formed an epoch in the history of
          English Unitarianism. In 1813, the Unitarians
          were placed by law on a par with other dissenters.
          The Unitarians of England and Wales are purely
          congregational in their church government, their
          only organ for combined action being the British
          and Foreign Unitarian Association, which holds
          its meetings annually in London. The Unitarians
          have 355 ministers, 352 chapels, and about 80
          mission stations in the British Empire.</p>
                <p>In the United States, the first secession from
          the Episcopal Church took place in 1787 on
          Unitarian grounds. About 1815, the important
          influence of Channing was thrown into the scale
          in favour of Unitarianism; and since then, Massachusetts,
          and particularly Boston, has been the
          stronghold of Unitarianism in America. The
          Unitarians have upwards of 250 societies in the
          States, and upwards of 20 in Boston.</p>
                <p>The Unitarians of the present day must be divided
          into two classes : a conservative and a progressive
          class, or, as they are often called, an old and
          a new school. The former adopt the old rule of
          the sufficiency of Scripture, though with many
          such qualifications as the scientific criticism of the
          Bible appears to them to render indispensable.
          They generally hold the simple humanity of
          Christ, but retain the belief in miracles, which
          they regard as supernatural sanctions of the
          truth of Christianity. According to this view,
          Christ is an ambassador from heaven to earth,
          the miracles he wrought are his credentials and
          the moral and religious truths which he taught are
          his message. The progressive school of Unitarians,
          on the other hand, regard Christianity not as
          a message or a system of truth communicated and
          authenticated from without, but as the highest
          expression of the Divine in humanity, not depending
          for proof on miracles, which a minority of
          their number reject, on the twofold ground, that,
          as it seems to them, they are intrinsically incredible,
          and that the evidence for them is conflicting
          and uncertain. Holding that inspiration is a
          quality which is not peculiar to the Bible, they
          maintain that each book of Scripture is to be
          studied, not as a collection of infallible oracles, but
          as a record of the mind of the age in which it
          was produced. The Unitarians of all shades of

                <head>THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDS.</head>
                <p>It is perhaps more in the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> than in the
          <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of their faith that the Society of Friends
          (or Quakers, as they are sometimes called) differ
          from other orthodox Christians. They themselves
          assert their belief in the great fundamental facts of
          Christianity, and even in the substantial identity
          of most of their doctrinal opinions with those of
          other evangelical denominations. Their principal
          distinguishing doctrine is that of the <q>Light of
          Christ in Man</q>, on which many of their outward
          peculiarities as a religious body are grounded.</p>
                <p>Founded in England by George Fox in the
          17th century, the Society of Friends has made
          greater progress in America, where the celebrated
          Penn belonged to their number. About the year
          1827, Elias Hicks created a schism in the Society
          in America by denying the miraculous conception,
          divinity, and atonement of Christ, and the
          authenticity and divine authority of the Holy
          Scriptures. A reactionary movement took place
          both in England and America towards Evangelism,
          which was headed by Joseph John Gumey
          of Norwich, and which resulted in a division
          among the orthodox Friends themselves, and in
          the formation of a new sect, called Wilburites, who
          are noted for the strictness with which they maintain
          the traditions and peculiarities of the Society.</p>
                <p>The Friends do not consider human learning
          essential to a minister of the gospel, believing that
          the call to the ministerial work is <q>not of men,
          neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the
          Father</q> ; and that it is bestowed irrespectively of
          rank, talent, learning, or sex ; that the ministry
          ought to be exercised freely, and, in general, that
          Christians should do all for love, and nothing for
          money. Their mode of conducting public worship
          illustrates the entireness of their dependence on
          the <q>internal light</q>. In other religious bodies, the
          minister has a set <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of worship ; the Friends
          meet and remain in silence until they believe
          themselves moved to speak by the Holy Ghost.
          Their prayers and praises are for the most part
          silent and inward. The doctrine of the <q>internal
          light</q> has also led them to reject the ordinances
          of Baptism and the Lord's Supper, as outwardly
          observed by other Christians. The taking or
          administering of oaths is regarded by Friends
          as inconsistent with the command of Christ,
          <q>Swear not at all</q>. They are opposed to the
          payment of tithes, the use of arms, and war in all
          its forms, as well as to capital punishment. They
          have all along been distinguished for the part
          they have taken in the movement for the emancipation
          of slaves. They object to <q>balls, gaming-places,
          horse-races, play-houses, oratorios</q>, which
          they regard as <q>profanation</q>.</p>
                <p>The arrangements and regulations pertaining
          to the interests of the Church are provided for in
          the institution of certain <q>meetings</q> or assemblies,
          analogous to those of the Presbyterian denomination.
          These are four in number : the preparative,
          monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings. To the
          latter, which consists of select or representative
          members of the quarterly meetings, belongs exclusively
          the legislative power. The Friends are
          distinguished by their liberality and provision for
          the wants of the poor of their body.</p>
                <p>The Society of Friends numbers in the British
          Empire 17,000 members, and has 265 recorded
          ministers, and 400 unrecorded ; and 327 places of
          worship in England and Wales. In America,
          their number exceeds 100,000.</p>

                <head>MORAVIANS.</head>
                <p>This religious community (also called <hi rend="italic">United
          Brethren, Moravian Brethren, or Bohemian</hi>
                    <pb n="73"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Brethren</hi>) traces its origin to the followers of John
          Huss, who were expelled by persecution from
          Bohemia and Moravia in the beginning of the
          18th century, and who, in gradually increasing
          numbers, settled on the estate of Count Zinzendorf,
          Berthelsdorf, in Saxony. To this settlement they
          gave the name of Herrnhut (or the Lord's charge).
          Zinzendorf with others joined the little brotherhood,
          who received the doctrines of the Augsburg
          Confession. The Moravians profess to be connected
          with the Bohemian or Moravian Brethren
          of former times by a regular succession of bishops.
          The bishops, however, exercise no episcopal
          authority, and their chief peculiar function is that
          of ordination, of which they alone have the power.
          Every congregation is governed by a <hi rend="italic">Conference
          of Elders</hi>. The elders are bound to visit each
          family once in three months, and to report concerning
          the maintenance of family worship, and the
          conduct of the brethren, to visit the sick, and to
          aid the poor with money contributed by the other
          brethren. The whole church is governed by
          synods, which meet - always in Germany - at
          intervals of ten or twelve years. Between one
          synod and another, all affairs are managed by
          a <hi rend="italic">Conference of Elders</hi> appointed for the purpose.</p>
                <p>Moravians are to some extent scattered amongst
          the general population of the countries in which
          they dwell ; but they prefer, where it is possible, to
          live in colonies, or separate societies. Colonies of
          Moravians exist in England, America, and Holland,
          but are most numerous and important in Germany
          and the mission-fields. The Brethren early entered
          on missionary work, and all the prosperity of their
          Church has been evidently connected with their
          earnest prosecution of it. They have missions in
          the West Indies, Greenland, Labrador, the Cape
          of Good Hope, Sarepta in Russia, &amp;c. They have
          at their mission stations over 70,000 converts from
          heathenism.</p>
                <p>The religious services of the Moravians are
          conducted with great simplicity. They meet for
          worship daily, in the evening, the service being
          much like that of a <hi rend="italic">prayer-meeting</hi> amongst other
          Christians. They use a litany on the Lord's
          day, but extemporary prayer is frequent. They
          admit the use of instrumental music. They maintain
          the practice of washing the feet, both in choirs
          (or classes) and in congregations, before the communion.
          They meet on the last day of the year,
          to bring in the New Year with prayer and other
          exercises of religion. On Easter morning, they
          assemble in the burying-ground to celebrate the
          resurrection of Christ, and to express their confidence
          concerning their brethren who have died
          during the preceding year. The death of a member
          of the brotherhood is made known in the chief
          settlements by sound of trumpets, as if for victory.</p>
                <p>The Moravians have in the British Empire
          83 churches and preaching stations, and 5550
          members.</p>

                <head>SWEDENBORGIANS.</head>
                <p>The Swedenborgians, or, as they designate themselves,
          <q>The New Church signified by the New
          Jerusalem in the Revelation</q>, were first organised
          as a separate body in 1788, by Robert Hindmarsh,
          a printer in Clerkenwell, London, who was elected
          by lot to baptise and to ordain his comrades in
          the ministry. The Swedenborgians accept Swedenborg's
          voluminous writings as revelations from
          heaven, and regard them as infallible. According
          to Swedenborg, who flourished through the
          greater part of last century, Scripture has two
          senses, a natural and a spiritual, the latter of
          which it fell to him to unvei. He held that
          Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one in the person
          of Christ ; that the last judgment, terminating
          the Church initiated by the divine advent, was
          effected in the year 1757, in the world of spirits,
          after which began a new dispensation, signified
          by the New Jerusalem in the Revelation ; that all
          angels have lived on earth ; that all in whom love
          to God and man is the ruling principle, go to
          heaven at death ; while all in whom self-love is the
          ruling motive, go to hell, which, as a whole, is called
          the Devil or Satan, there being no individual bearing
          that name ; that all pass to their final lot at
          death save a few, who make a short sojourn in
          an intermediate state for the purposes of purification
          and final decision. His two most distinctive
          tenets are the doctrines, first, of correspondences,
          according to which the natural world is a repetition
          of the spiritual, and the spiritual world of the
          invisible mental world ; and, second, that God
          alone lives - man and creation are dead ; their
          apparent life is the divine presence.</p>
                <p>The Swedenborgians transact their connectional
          legislation by means of a conference composed
          of both laymen and ministers, sent as
          representatives from each congregation. Their
          worship and ceremonies are simple, and present
          no striking features. The number of their societies
          in Britain is 58, with 4207 registered members.
          They are more numerous in the United States.
          In France, Germany, Sweden, and Russia there
          are Swedenborgians, but few and scattered.</p>

                <head>THE APOSTOLIC CATHOLIC CHURCH.</head>
                <p>This body is usually called by the name of
          Irvingites, from its founder, Edward Irving, a
          distinguished minister of the Scotch Church in
          London, who, in the winter of 1829-30, delivered
          a series of lectures on spiritual gifts, in which he
          maintained that those we are in the habit of
          calling <q>extraordinary</q>, or miraculous, were not
          meant to be confined to the primitive Church, but
          to be continued through the whole period of the
          present dispensation. In connection with some
          singular manifestations at Port-Glasgow, in the
          west of Scotland, and in his own church in
          Regent Square, it was alleged that miraculous
          acts of healing had taken place, and that the gift
          of tongues had reappeared. Irving was deposed
          for heresy by the Church of Scotland, and propagated
          his views as the founder of the Apostolic
          Catholic Church, of which the constitution is
          briefly as follows:</p>
                <p>There are, as in the apostolic times, four ministries: 
          (1) That of <q>Apostles</q>, to whom alone
          appertain spiritual prerogatives ; (2) that of <q>Prophets</q>,
          to whom it belongs to give <q>exhortations to holiness,
          interpretations of Scripture, openings of
          prophecy, and explanations of symbols</q>;
          (3) that of <q>Evangelists</q>, whose function it is to <q>bring in</q>
          those who are without ; and (4) that of <q>Angels</q>,
          or Pastors. The ministers of each congregation
          comprise an angel with six ruling presbyters ;
          various assistant ministers, deacons, and deaconesses; 
          evangelists, and those who may have<pb n="74"/>prophetic or other gifts. This ministry is supported
          by tithes, the people giving a tenth of their
          income for the support of the priesthood. Church
          affairs are managed by a council of ministers of
          all classes, whose selection and arrangement are
          believed to have been foreshadowed in the structure
          of the Mosaic Tabernacle. The Catholic
          Apostolic Church does not differ from other
          Christian bodies in regard to the common doctrines
          of the Christian religion ; it only accepts, in what
          it considers to be a fuller and more real sense,
          the <hi rend="italic">phenomena</hi> of Christian life. A very special
          feature is its extensive and elaborate symbolism.
          In regard to the sacrament of the Lord's Supper,
          however, it appears to entertain very much the
          same view as that of the Roman Catholic Church.
          The Catholic Apostolic Church has established
          itself in the United States, Prussia, France,
          Switzerland, as well as in Great Britain, where it
          has 19 churches.</p>

            <div>
                <head>THE PLYMOUTH BRETHREN.</head>
                <p>Originating in a reaction against exclusive High
          Church principles, and against a dead formalism
          associated with <q>unevangelical</q> doctrine, the
          <q>Plymouth Brethren</q> numbered amongst their
          first members in Plymouth, and elsewhere, many
          retired Anglo-Indian officers, men of unquestionable zeal and piety. 
          Their existence as a distinct
          sect is, however, very much to be ascribed to the
          labours and influence of Mr Darby, a barrister,
          who, under deeply religious impressions, became
          a clergyman of the Church of England, which he
          afterwards left, from conscientious scruples, and
          laboured as an evangelist both in England and
          on the continent of Europe, preaching in French,
          English, and German, and giving utterance to
          his opinions in numerous pamphlets, and in a
          quarterly periodical called <hi rend="italic">The Christian Witness</hi>,
          which for a number of years was the organ of the
          Plymouth Brethren. His tenets, and those of the
          sect in general, are, upon the whole, Calvinistic.
          Millenarian views are held very generally by the
          Plymouth Brethren, who are also, in the matter
          of baptism, Baptists. Their most distinctive
          peculiarity, however, is their complete rejection
          of ecclesiastical organisation. They refuse to
          recognise any form of church government, or any
          office of the ministry ; and they insist much on
          the equal right of every <hi rend="italic">male</hi> member of the
          church to <q>prophesy</q>, or preach. The Plymouth
          Brethren reject every distinctive appellation except
          that of Christians ; but, while endeavouring
          to realise in their system the comprehensive
          unity and charity of the primitive
          church, they have become practically very much
          divided. Among other divisions, a great schism
          took place among them in consequence of doctrines
          preached at Plymouth and Bristol concerning
          the human nature of Christ Their
          number exceeds 100,000.</p>

            <div>
                <head>THE GREEK CHURCH.</head>
                <p>Taken in its widest sense, the Greek Church
          comprehends all those Christians following the
          Greek or Greco-Slavonic rite, who receive the first
          seven general councils, but reject the authority of
          the Roman pontiff, and the later councils of the
          Western Church. The Greek Church calls itself
          <q>The Holy Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic
          Church</q>, and it includes three distinct branches -
          the Church within the Ottoman Empire, subject
          directly to the Patriarch of Constantinople ; the
          Church in the kingdom of Greece ; and the Russo-
          Greek Church in the dominions of the Czar. The
          proper history of the Greek Church as a separate
          body dates from the commencement of the efforts
          on the part of the Church of Constantinople to
          establish for itself a distinct jurisdiction, and an
          independent headship in the eastern division of
          the empire. The ecclesiastical pre-eminence of
          Constantinople, which followed upon the political
          distinction to which it rose as the seat of the
          imperial residence, and the centre of the imperial
          government, was promoted by the eminent
          qualities of some of the bishops, and especially
          of Chrysostom. Many circumstances ultimately
          combined to bring about a rupture between the
          two churches : the contests about image-worship,
          in which the patriarchs in more than one instance
          took the part of the iconoclast emperors ;
          the abandonment by the emperors of the defence
          of Italy against the Lombards ; the gradual
          growth of an independent confederation of Italian
          states, and the foundation of a new empire of
          the west, the political antagonism of which with
          the eastern empire, almost necessarily involved
          an antagonism of the churches themselves. The
          Latin doctrine of the twofold procession of the
          Holy Ghost, and the addition of <q>Filioque</q> to the
          Latin creed, the Latin practice of clerical celibacy,
          the use of unleavened bread, and the denying to
          priests the power of administering confirmation,
          supplied other grounds of controversy and quarrel,
          and though repeated efforts at a general union
          were made, they were unsuccessful. It is the
          same with attempts which have been made by
          Protestant communions to establish an understanding
          with the Greek Church.</p>
                <p>Anterior to the Mohammedan conquest, the
          Greek Church comprised within its limits Greece,
          properly so called, the Peloponnesus, Eastern
          Illyricum, the islands, and Asia Minor, as also
          Syria and Palestine, Arabia, Egypt, and parts of
          Mesopotamia and Persia. But with the first
          triumph of the Koran, the Church of Constantinople
          by degrees lost almost all her territory in
          Asia and Africa ; and since the conquest of the
          Turks, it has sunk into the condition of a weak
          and oppressed dependant.</p>
                <p>In general, it may be inferred from the fact
          that the Greek Church receives the first seven
          councils, that on all the controversies regarding
          the Trinity and Incarnation, the Greeks are
          agreed with the Western Catholics, with the
          exception of the double procession of the Holy
          Ghost. The Greeks accept as the rule of faith
          the traditions of the Church, preserved by the
          testimony of the Fathers, in addition to the Bible
          and the deuterocanonical books. They admit
          the seven sacraments as received by the Roman
          Church. Baptism is, however, administered among
          them by a triple immersion, and confirmation
          is administered in immediate connection with
          baptism. As to the Eucharist, the Greeks admit
          the real presence of Christ, the transubstantiation
          of the elements, and the propitiatory sacrifice.
          But they differ from Catholics in the use of
          leavened bread, in administering the communion
          in both kinds, and in administering it in this<pb n="75"/>sform even to children. In the matter of penance,
          they recognise auricular confession, priestly absolution,
          and penitential works. The Greeks differ
          from Catholics in not only permitting married
          candidates to be advanced to deaconship and
          priesthood, but in even requiring, as a general
          rule, that they shall be actually married before
          they can be admitted to orders. But marriage
          is forbidden in the case of bishops, who are
          always chosen from the monastic, and not the
          secular clergy. While they reject the purgatorial
          fire of the Western Catholics, they admit the
          principle of the intermediate state of purgation,
          and of the practice of prayer for the dead, as well
          as the intercession and invocation of saints. In
          addition to four yearly fasts, they observe the
          Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year
          as fasts. In public prayer, the kneeling posture
          is used only at Pentecost ; at ordinary times,
          they stand, the body being turned towards the
          east. The use of the sign of the cross is habitual
          among them, and they freely receive and multiply
          pictures, which they hold in high honour, and on
          which they lavish the most costly ornaments.</p>
                <p>The monastic institute has subsisted in the
          Greek Church from the earliest times, and numerous
          convents of both sexes are dispersed over the
          east : the abbot is called Hegumenos, and the
          abbess, Hegumene ; if several convents be subject
          to a single abbot, he is called Archimandrite.</p>
                <p>The Greek Church is divided into three great
          sections. In the Turkish Empire, the Church has
          remained subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople,
          who from the beginning held the rank of
          a <q>pacha of three tails</q>, but in return, the Porte
          claimed and exercised the right of appointing and
          also of deposing the Patriarch. For a long time
          the Metropolitan of Russia (afterwards Patriarch)
          was directly subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople,
          as also the bishop of the modern kingdom
          of Greece ; but both churches are now independent.
          In the year 1589, a separate but dependent
          patriarchate was established at Moscow, which
          continued until the time of Peter the Great, by
          whom it was first suspended, and, twenty years
          afterwards, abolished. The Russo-Greek Church
          is now governed by a council called the <q>Holy
          Synod</q>, or <q>Permanent Synod</q>, which consists
          of archbishop, bishops, and archimandrites, all
          named by the emperor. This synod is regarded
          as one of the great departments of the government,
          the Minister of Public Worship being <hi rend="italic">ex
          officio</hi> a member. The liturgy of the Russian
          Church is the same as that of Constantinople,
          but it is celebrated, not in the Greek, but in the
          Slavonic language.</p>
                <p>The independence of the Church of the kingdom 
          of Greece dates from the revolution. The
          new Church was formally organised by a decree
          of July 1833, on a plan in great part borrowed
          from the constitution of the Russian Church. In
          Greece, the <q>Holy Synod</q> consists of five members,
          who are ordinarily archbishops or bishops,
          named by the crown, and holding office but
          for a year. The synod elects bishops, but the
          crown has the right of confirming and granting
          investiture.</p>
                <p>The adherents of the Greek Church number
          about 75 millions ; Russia containing 44 millions,
          with 73 bishops, of whom 7 are metropolitans, and
          28 archbishops.</p>

            <div>
                <head>Sects of the Greek Church.</head>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">Nestorians</hi>. - This sect had its origin in the
          denial by Nestorius (431 a.d.) of the propriety
          of the expression <q>mother of God</q> as applied to
          Christ. His followers exaggerated the distinction
          of two natures in our Lord into a distinction of
          two persons, united merely by a unity of will and
          affection. Although vigorously repressed in the
          Roman Empire, Nestorianism was protected by
          the Persians, and was ultimately established by
          King Pherozes as the national church, with a
          patriarch at Seleucia. The Nestorians now number
          about 140,000. They recognise the seven sacraments,
          observe frequent fasts, and pray for the
          dead. They are governed by a patriarch at Diz
          and 18 bishops. Another body of Nestorians
          exist in India, numbering 100,000.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Jacobites</hi> are the oriental sect of Monophysites,
          or believers in the doctrine that Christ had
          but one nature. The name <hi rend="italic">Jacobites</hi> belongs
          more specially to the Monophysites of Syria,
          Mesopotamia, and Chaldea, who number about
          40,000 families.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Coptic Church</hi> consists of the Christian
          descendants of the ancient Egyptians, who are
          generally Monophysites and number 150,000.
          Their highest dignitary is the Patriarch of Alexandria,
          who, however, resides at Cairo. The Copts
          are strict in their religious observances ; baptise
          by immersion ; practise unction, exorcism, auricular
          confession ; and celebrate the Lord's Supper
          with leavened bread which has been dipped in
          wine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Abyssinian Church</hi> is national and independent,
          but its visible head, or <hi rend="italic">Abuna</hi> (<q>our
          Father</q>), is ordained by the Coptic Patriarch
          of Alexandria. The doctrines of the Abyssinian
          Church coincide with those of the Coptic Church,
          especially in the Monophysite heresy ; but several
          peculiar rites are observed, including circumcision
          of both sexes, and observance of the Mosaic
          laws respecting food, &amp;c. love-feasts, and adult
          baptism.</p>
                <p>Christianity was established in <hi rend="italic">Armenia</hi> towards
          the close of the 3d century. In the
          ecclesiastical controversy concerning the twofold
          nature of Christ, the Armenian Christians held
          with the Monophysites, and constituted themselves
          a separate church. On the whole, it resembles
          the Greek Church in doctrine and sacerdotal
          constitution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Maronites</hi>, descendants of the Monothelite
          sect, have their chief seat on the western declivity
          of Mount Lebanon, and number about 150,000,
          distributed into 150 parishes. They are ruled by
          a patriarch, who is still styled Patriarch of
          Antioch, and 17 bishops. The Maronites have
          many convents for both sexes.</p>
                <p>A number of sects, designated by the name of
          <hi rend="italic">Raskolnik</hi> (Russian <hi rend="italic">Separatist</hi>), equivalent to dissenter,
          exist in Russia, whose nonconformity began
          to appear on a considerable scale from the middle
          of the 17th century, when the ancient Slavonic liturgical
          and ritual books underwent revision. The
          revisions introduced into the churches by the
          authority of the Czar and Patriarch were resisted
          as innovations by the Raskolniks, who in later
          times were called Starowierzi (<q>Men of the Old
          Faith</q>), and who, while differing from one another
          in doctrine, follow certain common observances.<pb n="76"/>They are generally divisible into two classes -
          those who have popes (priests), and those who do
          not recognise the priestly order. The Raskolniks
          have among them those who, from their peculiarities,
          are called <hi rend="italic">self-baptisers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">self-ordainers</hi>.</p>

            <div>
                <head>THE JEWS.</head>
                <p>Historically developed from Judaism, originally
          based on the Old Testament Scriptures, which
          constitute the Jewish rule of faith, and purporting
          to be the blessing which the Jews still look forward
          to, Christianity is intimately related to Judaism.
          In their history, as well as in their literature,
          the Jews are amongst the most remarkable people
          in the world. The records which lie at the
          foundation of the Christian and Mohammedan
          faiths find living embodiment in a race which,
          while partaking of the culture and general advancement
          of humanity, still cling with tenacity
          to institutions of remote antiquity. The persistency
          of national sentiment, which proved the
          occasion of the dispersion and expatriation of
          the Jews, was preserved among them amid the
          most astonishing series of persecutions that history
          records, and from which they have in recent times
          emerged into a condition of wealth, general eminence
          and influence, which rank them among the
          foremost promoters of civilisation at the present
          day. '<quote>If there is a gradation in sufferings,</quote>' it has
          been well said, <quote>Israel has reached the highest
          acme ; if the long duration of sufferings, and
          patience with which they are borne, ennobles,
          the Jews defy the high-born of all countries ; if
          literature is called rich which contains a few
          classical dramas, what place deserves a tragedy
          lasting a millennium and a half, composed and
          enacted by the heroes themselves?</quote>'</p>
                <p>While retaining their belief in the credibility
          of their Scriptures, they have shared in surrounding
          influences in the method of interpreting
          them. The Rationalistic and the Supranaturalistic
          schools of biblical criticism divide Jews and
          Christians alike. The Jews have been famed for
          their attention to ceremonial observances. Their
          principal festivals are the New Year, the Day of
          Atonement, the Feast of Tabernacles, the New
          Moon, the Dedication, Purim, the Passover, and
          Pentecost. A division took place, a short time
          ago, among the Jews in this country, which forms
          an important feature in their history. The seceders
          reject the oral or traditional law, and seek to
          improve the character and observance of public
          worship. They have appointed a rabbi of their
          own, have revised their liturgy, and give themselves
          the title of British Jews. The sects of
          former times have all died out, with the exception
          of the Caraites or Scripturists, so called from their
          upholding the sufficiency of the Old Testament
          writings without the tradition of the oral law.
          Their number is not large, and they are found
          chiefly in the East.</p>
                <p>The Jews number about 50,000 in the United
          Kingdom, principally in London and other large
          towns, and these have 80 synagogues, with about
          100 ministers and readers. The number of Jews
          throughout the world is estimated at seven millions
          and a half</p>

                <head>THE MORMONS.</head>
                <p>Although Mormonism has nothing in common
          with Christianity, yet, as it is the most remarkable
          religious phenomenon of modern times, a brief
          notice of it will not be out of place in concluding
          this paper. It is American in its origin, its
          founder, Joseph Smith, having been born in Vermont
          in 1805. At an early age, he was visited,
          he says, by supernatural revelations and appearances ; 
          and when eighteen years old, was directed
          in a vision to seek for the <q>record</q> of a new faith,
          which was to supersede all others, and of which
          he was to become the prophet. The record, when
          discovered, proved to be a number of thin golden
          plates, inscribed closely with letters in a peculiar
          character ; and with them, to enable him
          to translate the inscription, he found the Urim
          and Thummim, in the shape of a large pair of
          spectacles. Some years after, he professed to
          have deciphered these, and the result was the
          <hi rend="italic">Book of Mormon</hi>, a history, so called, of the
          American Indians, whom Smith declared by revelation 
          to be descendants of the lost tribes of the
          Israelites. This book was in reality taken from a
          manuscript romance written by a quondam clergyman,
          named Solomon Spalding, who died in
          1816.</p>
                <p>The Mormons fixed on a spot for a permanent
          possession, far away in the valley of the Salt Lake,
          beyond the Rocky Mountains. The emigration
          commenced in 1846, and lasted for two years.
          To this spot, emigrants from all lands have betaken
          themselves to join the Mormon Zion. The
          settlement has been added to the United States
          under the name of Utah ; but the government has
          been carried on by the Mormon rulers. In
          consequence of the railway to San Francisco passing
          over the Rocky Mountains, the region
          of Utah has become accessible, and an effort
          has been lately made by the government of the
          United States to terminate the anomalies of
          Mormonism, but as yet without success. The
          Mormons number about 200,000. They have 82
          churches in the United Kingdom. In the Mormon
          system of government, which is purely theocratic,
          there are various orders, including the <hi rend="italic">First Presidency</hi>,
          composed of three successors to Peter,
          James, and John, in the Gospel Church, and
          of whom Brigham Young is <hi rend="italic">primus inter pares</hi>;
          the <hi rend="italic">Patriarchate</hi>, whose chief function is to administer
          blessings ; <q>The <hi rend="italic">Twelve</hi>
                    </q>, who ordain all
          other officers, baptise, and take the lead in all
          meetings ; the <hi rend="italic">Seventies</hi>, who are the missionaries
          and preachers of the body ; and the <hi rend="italic">Highpriests,
          Bishops, Elders, Priests, Teachers</hi>, and
          <hi rend="italic">Deacons</hi>.</p>
                <p>In doctrine, the <hi rend="italic">Church of Jesus Christ of
          Latter-day Saints</hi> is very peculiar. Preposterously
          materialistic in their conceptions of God - who,
          according to Brigham Young, is President of the
          Immortals, consisting of gods, angels, men, and
          spirits - the Mormons believe that by faith, obedience,
          and holiness, any man may rise into a deity ;
          that the spirit of man was not created ; and that
          Jesus Christ is shortly to appear, and reign in the
          Mormon Zion. Mormonism may be regarded as
          being virtually a system of eclecticism, and an
          attempt at such a new social order as shall conserve
          the main principles of natural virtue, and
          contribute to material and social prosperity in the
          community, as well as to rewards in a material
          heaven. To this end, Mormons maintain that
          their hierarchical government and practice of
          polygamy are eminently subservient.</p>

                </head>
                <p>RELIGION, in Christian countries, is generally
          understood as the feeling of reverence
          towards the Creator and Ruler of the world, together
          with all those acts of worship and service
          to which that feeling leads. The root of this
          sentiment lies in the very constitution of man and
          in the circumstances in which he is placed, and
          manifests itself abundantly even where the one
          supreme God of the Christian is unknown. Man
          is naturally religious, and if he is ignorant of
          the true God, he must make to himself false ones.
          He is surrounded by dangers and difficulties ; he
          sees the mighty powers of nature at work all
          around, pregnant to him with hope and fear, and
          yet inscrutable in their working, and beyond his
          control. Hence arises the feeling of <hi rend="italiic">dependence</hi>
          upon something more powerful than himself - the
          very germ of religion. These operations of nature,
          again, he has only one way of conceiving and
          accounting for. The idea of physical causes is
          one of late growth ; to the primitive man there
          is only one kind of agency he can understand -
          that of a will or mind like his own. Hence all
          things that he sees moving and acting become
          to him animated, conscious beings, with thoughts
          and passions similar to those of men ; and what
          more natural than that he should seek, by offerings
          and entreaties, to secure their favour or propitiate
          their malignity or anger? There is, no
          doubt, a vast distance between the reverence with
          which the Christian looks up to Him that fills the
          universe, and that of the poor negro doctor who
          was observed by Dr Livingstone to speak in a
          whisper when he approached his basket of medicines
          or charms, lest he should offend the power
          which he conceived to lie concealed therein. But
          in both cases it is the same feeling that is at the
          bottom ; they are both manifesting religion.<note>The word <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> is of Latin origin, and according to its
            etymology would mean <q>binding</q>, <q>obligation</q>, or rather <q>restraint</q>.
            It was applied by the Romans to all actions in which men are
            guided, not by motives deducible from the ordinary course of
            nature, but by regard to some unseen power or mysterious influence
            ; as when Livy says of a spot in the Forum : <hi rend="italic">&gt;ubi despui religio
            est</hi>, <q>where spitting is a matter of religion</q> ;
            that is, where there is a religious scruple restraining people from spitting.</note>
                </p>
                <p>According to this view, religion includes all
          forms of belief in the unseen and spiritual powers,
          or gods, together with the practices arising out
          of those beliefs. The forms that religious belief
          has assumed are endless, but they may be all
          classed under two heads : <hi rend="italic">Monotheism</hi>, or the
          belief in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> God ; and <hi rend="italic">Polytheism</hi>, or the belief
          in <hi rend="italic">many</hi> gods. In most, if not in all polytheistic
          systems of religion, there is one of the gods superior
          to the rest in power and dignity, with more
          or less of acknowledged supremacy over them;
          still, within a certain sphere, they all have independent
          power, are all capable of doing man
          good or ill according as they are disposed towards
          him, without regard, or even in opposition, to the
          will of the supreme deity ; they are therefore all
          objects of hope and fear, and have to be individually
          worshipped and propitiated. Monotheism
          does not exclude the notion of various ranks of
          spiritual beings, good and evil, vastly superior to
          man in power, and capable of working him weal
          or woe ; but they are conceived as mere agents
          or messengers (angels) of the Supreme Ruler, and
          ministers of his love or of his anger.</p>
                <p>The doctrine that there is but one God has the
          testimony of a Divine revelation to its truth. It
          is common to Judaism and Christianity, both of
          which are founded on this revelation. The only
          other religion in which this great truth has been
          reached is Mohammedanism, which arose among
          a people nearly akin to the Jews, and in which
          the influence of the Jewish sacred writings is
          clearly manifest. The religions founded on the
          Bible - Judaism, namely, and the various forms of
          Christianity - having been described in the two preceding
          numbers, it remains to give some account
          of Mohammedanism, and then of some of the
          more important polytheistic or pagan religions.
          Polytheism, in its lowest degradations, takes the
          form of belief in a multiplicity of unseen influences,
          hardly conceived as personal and conscious gods,
          but operating in the incomprehensible way expressed
          by the words <hi rend="italic">magic, charm, witchcraft</hi>,
          &amp;c. It is this form of religious belief that is
          understood by the term <hi rend="italic">superstition</hi> ; and as
          superstition is not confined to pagan nations, but
          prevails even under the purest forms of Christianity,
          wherever there is ignorance and degradation,
          it will be convenient to consider this part of the<pb n="78"/>subject by itself. The chapter on superstitions
          will thus form a supplement applicable alike to
          monotheistic and polytheistic religions. Without
          adverting to this subject, the picture of no religious
          belief is complete ; even among well-educated
          Christians, the man or woman is rare who is
          altogether emancipated from polytheism in this
          sense.</p>

                <head>MOHAMMEDANISM.</head>
                <p>The origin of Mohammedanism is generally
          dated from 622 A.D., the year of the <hi rend="italic">Hejrah</hi>, or
          flight of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina.
          At this period the Mohammedan era begins, time
          being reckoned from it backward and forward, as
          it is from the birth of Christ throughout the
          Christian world. The circumstances under which
          the new religion was first preached, and the chief
          features of its history and progress, having been
          sketched in the HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE AGES,
          No. 60, we shall confine ourselves here to an
          account of its doctrines and practices. With the
          conquest of Constantinople by the Turks, and the
          establishment of the Afghan and Tatar dominion
          in India, the conquering progress of Mohammedanism
          may be said to have terminated. At
          present, except that it is making considerable
          progress among the tribes of Africa, it is stationary,
          and, though retaining its superficial boundaries,
          is declining in internal vitality and vigour.
          Its professed adherents have been estimated at
          180 millions ; but it is scarcely necessary to state
          that in every estimate of this kind there is much
          room for error. In one instance, that of our
          Indian province of Bengal, it is now known that,
          previous to 1873, the number of the Mohammedan
          population was greatly under-estimated.</p>
                <p>The fundamental doctrines of Mohammedanism
          are belief in one God, and belief in one true
          religion - a religion which has existed since the
          beginning of the world, and been preached from
          age to age by God's apostles and prophets, but
          which was only fully revealed to mankind by
          Mohammed, the last and greatest of the apostles.
          These doctrines, embodied in the formula, '<quote>There
          is no God but God ; and Mohammed is God's
          apostle</quote>', are constantly on the lips of every
          Mohammedan. The devout reception of them
          involves everything included in the faith and duty
          of the true believer. The devout expression of
          them intimates that entire submission to God's
          will which is the essence of piety. Islam is the
          word which expresses this pious resignation to the
          will and precepts of God, and this being, as it
          were, the sum of all religion, Islam is the designation
          by which, among Mohammedans, the true
          religion is customarily denoted. Mohammedanism
          regards Adam, Moses, and Jesus as the
          greatest among those who prepared the way for
          the consummate teacher whose full and perfect
          revelation has superseded all other teaching. To
          Jesus it allows special honour. Deeming him a
          mere man, though a great prophet and apostle, it
          nevertheless admits that his birth was miraculous,
          and declares that he was taken up unto God without
          dying, the crucifixion being executed upon
          another person. He is to come again upon the
          earth to establish the Moslem religion everywhere, 
          and to be a sign of the coming of the day of judgment.</p>
                <p>Mohammedanism, like Christianity, teaches that
          the one God is the creator of all things in heaven
          and earth ; that He rules and preserves all things ;
          that He is eternal, unchangeable ; that He is omnipotent,
          omniscient, omnipresent, and full of mercy.
          It differs from Christianity in holding that God is
          one person, who <q>begetteth not, nor is He begotten</q> ;
          in repudiating the doctrine of the Trinity, and
          denying the divinity of Christ. Between God and
          man it places a hierarchy of angels, who wait upon
          God and adore Him, who watch and guard men,
          and intercede for them with God ; beings created of
          fire, with pure and subtile bodies, which, though
          like to those of men, and sometimes visible to
          favoured mortals, are exempt from the conditions
          and incidents of matter. Each order of the hierarchy
          has its special duty. The four chief angels
          are <q>The Holy Spirit</q>, or <q>Angel of Revelations</q>,
          Gabriel ; the special protector and guardian of
          the Jews, Michael; the <q>Angel of Death</q>, Azrael;
          and Israfil, whose office it will be to sound the
          trumpet at the resurrection. It also recognises
          another class of intermediate existences, the Jin
          or Genii, who are of a grosser fabric than the
          angels, and propagate their species, and are subject
          to death. Of the genii, as of the angels, there are
          orders, each with its special character and office
          (e. g., <hi rend="italic">peri</hi>, fairies ; <hi rend="italic">div</hi>, giants ; <hi rend="italic">takvin</hi>, fates) ;
          some are good beings, some evil ; and all from
          time to time take some part in unravelling or
          entangling the web of human affairs. Chief among
          the evil genii is Iblis (Despair), once called Azazil,
          and ranked among the angels most favoured of
          God, but who was cast down from this high estate
          because he refused to pay homage to Adam, with
          the other angels, at his creation. Coming down
          to men, Mohammedanism teaches that God has at
          all times had his chosen servants, through whom
          He communicated his will to men, and that the
          revelation of his will was from time to time
          embodied in inspired and sacred writings. The
          number of prophets commissioned by Him at various
          times is stated variously at between two and
          three hundred thousand; and of these, 313 were
          apostles, while six were authorised to proclaim
          new laws and dispensations, the later of which
          superseded the earlier. The six were Adam, Noah,
          Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, the last
          being the greatest of all, the propagator of the
          final dispensation, whose mission must not be
          disbelieved in under the direst penalties. The
          number of sacred Scriptures given to men is
          stated as 104 ; but of these, only four survive -
          the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Gospel, and the
          Koran ; and the first three are now imperfect,
          having been mutilated and falsified. The Koran,
          the Scriptures delivered by Mohammed, is now
          the sole and sufficient rule of faith and duty.</p>
                <p>The chief belief which operates upon conduct
          is, in the Mohammedan, as in the Christian
          system, the tremendous doctrine of the resurrection
          from the dead to a day of judgment, and a
          future of reward or of punishment, according to
          the beliefs held, and the deeds done in the body.
          And Mohammedanism has no trace of the
          Christian doctrine of vicarious punishment. It
          teaches, however, that while strict account will
          be taken of every man's actions, and the good
          weighed against the bad, it is not his own good<pb n="79"/>works or merits that can gain any man admittance
          to the place of everlasting happiness ; that this
          will come of God's mercy alone ; and that God is
          very merciful, and will shew mercy to all whose
          good, by how little soever, exceeds their evil. In
          the final accounting, according to a common
          belief, a process of adjustment, as between individuals,
          will have place : from those who have
          committed injuries, a portion of their stock of
          merit will be transferred to those whom they
          have injured ; and according to the result found
          after this process has been completed - according,
          that is, as, in each case, the good which remains
          outweighs or is outweighed by the evil, will be
          the judgment that will be given. Angels, genii,
          men, and animals - all who have ever lived -
          will appear for judgment. The trial over, the
          righteous will take the right-hand way, which
          leads to Paradise, and the wicked will pass to
          the left into hell. Both, however, have to go over
          the bridge Al Sirât, which is laid over the midst
          of hell, which is finer than a hair, and sharper
          than the edge of a sword, and beset with thorns
          on either side. This the righteous will cross
          with ease and swiftness. The wicked will fall
          from it into hell, and pass to the depth therein
          to which their careers have condemned them.
          For of hell, as Mohammedans conceive of it, there
          are seven stages, one below the other, each lower
          involving severer punishment than that which is
          above it. These are assigned, in their descending
          order, to Mohammedans, Jews, Christians, Sabians.
          Magians, idolaters, and hypocrites respectively ;
          the place of hypocrites who made a profession of
          religion while they had none, being the lowest
          and worst of all. Intense heat and cold will be
          the means of producing the suffering endured in
          hell. Mohammedans, and all who professed the
          unity of God, will eventually be delivered from
          it ; but the punishment of unbelievers and idolaters
          will be eternal. As to the righteous, destined
          for the abodes of eternal delight (Jannat
          Aden), after drinking of the Pond of the Prophet,
          which is supplied from the rivers of Paradise,
          whiter than milk and more odoriferous than musk,
          they will go on their way to the gates of Paradise,
          where they will be welcomed by beautiful youths
          and angels ; and then they will enter upon an
          existence of happiness corresponding to the
          degree of righteousness (whether that of prophet,
          teacher, martyr, or believer) to which each has
          attained. Of the felicity that will be enjoyed by
          the blessed, about a hundred different degrees
          have been described. Nearly all consist in sensuous
          delights ; and the capacity of language has
          been exhausted in the description of them. Suffice
          it, that the most gorgeous and delicious feasts, at
          which wine, exhilarating, yet not intoxicating, will
          not be wanting, the most costly and brilliant
          garments, odours and music the most exquisite,
          and, above all, the enjoyment of the Hur Al
          Oyûn, the black-eyed daughters of Paradise,
          created of pure musk, and free from all the bodily
          weaknesses of women, will be the portion of the
          commonest inhabitant of Paradise. Purely spiritual
          enjoyments will be provided for the higher
          natures, which deserve and can appreciate them.
          They will see God's face night and day. A
          separate abode of happiness will be reserved for
          women ; but of the nature of their enjoyments
          the disclosure has been meagre. The notion that
          Mohammedans hold that women have no souls,
          is entirely unfounded.</p>
                <p>The time of the resurrection, according to
          Mohammedan views, no man knows. It is a
          mystery ; Mohammed himself could not learn it
          from the angel Gabriel. But it will be foreshadowed
          by fearful signs and wonders. As to what
          shall arise at the day of judgment, Mohammedanism,
          like Christianity, has its controversies.
          Some theologians believe that the spirit only,
          others, that the body only, will be raised ; while
          a third opinion, which seems to have been that
          of Mohammed himself, asserts the resurrection
          of both soul and body. On the place of the soul,
          and its state after death and until the resurrection,
          also, opinions to some extent differ. All
          believe, however, that a dead person, when laid in
          his grave, is received by an angel, who announces
          to him the coming of the examiners, Monker
          and Nakîr, and that by them he is thereafter
          examined respecting his belief in God and in
          Mohammed, and according to his answers, either
          tortured, so that all beings except men and genii
          can hear his cries of anguish, or soothed and
          refreshed with the air of Paradise.</p>
                <p>That all good and evil is absolutely and irrevocably
          preordained, and that the duty of man is
          absolute acquiescence in, and submission to
          whatever happens, as being the will of God,
          is another leading doctrine of Mohammedanism.
          A man's fortunes in this world, his actions, his
          beliefs, and, of consequence, his lot in the future
          state, are considered as unalterably predestined;
          no man can, by taking thought, change the nature
          of what lies before him in the slightest degree. In
          the Koran, this doctrine is not to be found in the
          consistent form which it has assumed in Mohammedan
          theology, though expressions constantly
          occur which tend towards it, and from which,
          without violence, it might be deduced. There can
          be no doubt that Mohammedanism, during the
          ages of its greatness, owed much to the courage
          which its soldiers derived from the belief that
          their destiny was irrevocably fixed, and by no
          means to be avoided by flinching from any duty.</p>
                <p>To the dogmatical part of their religious system,
          of which a summary has now been given, Mohammedans
          give the name of Iman, or faith.
          The name religion, Din, they reserve for its practical
          side, which contains the ritual and moral
          laws, and lays down precepts of practice, both
          positive and prohibitory, declaring what the
          believer must do, and what he must avoid.</p>
                <p>Of positive duties, the chief inculcated are
        prayer, almsgiving, fasting, and pilgrimage.</p>
                <p>Prayer, <q>the key of Paradise</q>, stands foremost
          among them. The practice of religion being
          regarded as founded on cleanliness, without which
          prayer will not be heard by God, certain bodily
          purifications are indispensable preliminaries to,
          and are held to be included in, prayer. Washing
          of the hands, face, ears, and of the feet up to the
          ankles, accompanied at each stage of the process
          by pious recitations, is the preparation for prayer
          in ordinary cases ; but there are special occasions
          which require immersion of the whole body.
          The ground or carpet on which the believer prays
          must also be as clean as possible ; and before
          praying he must, in token of humility, put aside
          all costly or sumptuous articles of dress. Prayers
          are said five tunes in the twenty-four hours :<pb n="80"/>about sunset, at nightfall, about daybreak, about
          noon, and in the afternoon; the exact time of sunrise,
          noon, and sunset being avoided, to guard
          against the appearance of countenancing the
          worship of the sun. The prayers are in forms
          prescribed, which may not be abridged, except by
          travellers and by soldiers preparing for battle.
          They are made up of extracts from the Koran, and
          other writings attributed to Mohammed, and consist
          in praise of God, desires for his direction or
          assistance, and pious ejaculations, not at all of
          special petitions. They are uttered with the face
          turned towards Mecca, kneeling, but with much
          variety of posturing. Notice of the times of
          prayer is given by the chanting of mueddins, or
          criers, from the minarets of the mosques or places
          of worship ; and in these the prayers are recited
          by Imams, or ministers. Prayer, however, may be
          said anywhere ; women, indeed, must always say
          the appointed prayers in some place other than
          the mosque, for it they are not allowed to enter,
          while men are there, lest their presence should
          distract the men from their devotions. The
          Imam is simply a qualified person selected to go
          through the appointed ritual by the warden of
          the mosque, and holding office at his pleasure.
          No religious character belongs to him. In our
          sense of the word, the Mohammedans have no
          clergy.</p>
                <p>Next to prayer, stands the duty of almsgiving.
          Once every year, the law requires the
          giving of alms, consisting of cattle, money, corn,
          fruit, and other articles which can be sold ; and it
          is customary to give away provisions to the poor
          at the end of the sacred month of Ramadan.</p>
                <p>Fasting, though third in order of the positive
          duties, is a duty much insisted upon among
          Mohammedans : it is said to be <q>a fourth part
          of the faith</q>; nay, to be <q>the gate of religion</q>.
          It consists in abstaining from satisfying the appetites
          ; in restraining the ears, eyes, tongue, and
          other bodily members from sin; in keeping the
          thoughts away from worldly cares, and fixing them
          upon God. During the whole of the month of
          Ramadan, the Moslem is required to fast from
          daybreak until sunset. Though there is no restraint
          upon indulgence between sunset and daybreak,
          the fasting is a severe trial of constancy at
          all times, but especially when (the Arabian years
          being lunar) the sacred month falls in the hot
          season. The fasting, particularly the abstinence
          from drink, is then excessively mortifying. Nurses
          and pregnant women are exempt from the fast;
          so are sick people, travellers, and soldiers on a
          campaign, though they are required to make
          up for the omission at other times.</p>
                <p>Once at least to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, is
          the last of the leading positive duties of the Moslem.
          Inability from poverty, ill-health, or other good
          cause, may excuse from its performance ; but as
          to him who through negligence omits it, it is
          deemed he might <q>as well die a Jew or a Christian</q>.
          The Kaaba, or temple of Mecca, with its
          Black Stone, which bears the mark of Abraham's
          foot, and with other traces of the patriarch, had
          been regarded as sacred long before the time
          of Mohammed. Mohammed found the annual
          pilgrimage sanctioned by the usage of ages, and
          he accepted it, and found a place for it in his
          system. The ceremonies of the Hadj or pilgrimage
          take place in the month called Zil-hadj.
          Pilgrims come from every Mohammedan country.
          Apart from the pilgrimage, Mecca is to Mohammedans
          a holy city, full of spots which are
          regarded with deep veneration. The pilgrimage
          is frequently, if not habitually, followed by a visit
          to Medina, where is Mohammed's tomb.</p>
                <p>Among minor positive duties, is that of keeping
          the appointed festivals, of which that which succeeds
          the month of Ramadan, though not the most
          important, is not unnaturally the most joyfully
          celebrated. The observance of Friday as the day
          of rest and worship may also be here mentioned.
          This, like the pilgrimage, was an established
          institution in Arabia for ages before the time of
          Mohammed. There is a service, including devotional
          readings from the Koran, and usually a
          sermon at the mosque ; but, that over, work is
          not forbidden ; those may work who cannot afford
          to give the whole day to pleasure and devotion.</p>
                <p>Among things forbidden by Mohammedanism
          are the drinking of wine - under which are included
          all spirituous and intoxicating liquors - and, in
          the opinion of the very rigid, opium, coffee, and
          tobacco also ; the eating of the flesh of swine,
          and of the flesh of animals which have died from
          disease or age, which have been strangled or
          killed by a blow or fall, or by some other
          beast, or on which the name of an idol has
          been invoked, or which have been sacrificed
          to idols, or which have not been slaughtered
          according to rules prescribed ; and the use of
          the blood of animals. Games of chance are
          strictly prohibited, but, according to the majority
          of theologians, not games of skill, such as chess ;
          usury also is forbidden ; and to make an imitation
          of any living being in any material is not
          only forbidden, but considered one of the worst of
          offences, being regarded as tending to idolatry.</p>
                <p>The social regulations of Mohammedanism - its laws,
          civil and criminal - are, equally with its code
          of personal duties, of religious obligation, resting
          as they do upon the same authority, the teaching
          of the Prophet. The principal Mohammedan
          governments, however, have had to depart in some
          degree from the strict law of Islam, it being impossible
          for a government dealing with a society in
          any degree advanced to adhere rigidly to its
          prescriptions. Mohammed seems in the main to
          have accepted the laws he found existing about
          him, abrogating or altering where he thought it
          necessary. His laws are therefore those proper
          to a semi-savage people, and they have proved
          a heavy incubus on the advance of Mohammedan
          peoples. The law allows polygamy, but
          not without restriction ; a man may not have more
          than four wives, but he may have a certain number
          of concubines besides. The limitations put
          upon marriage on the grounds of consanguinity
          or propinquity are, generally speaking, the same
          with those of the Jewish law; and the tie of milk -
          that is, connection through a foster-mother - bars
          marriage in every degree in which the tie of blood
          prevents it. To say to his wife, <q>Thou art
          divorced</q>, or, <q>I divorce thee</q>, and to pay back
          part of the dowry, are all a husband has to do to
          terminate a disagreeable connection. The woman,
          on the other hand, if under age, can be given in
          marriage by her guardians without her consent
          and is bound to her husband for ever, unless she
          can prove some flagrant ill-usage, or neglect of conjugal
          duty on his part.</p>
                <pb n="81"/>
                <p>The ethics of Mohammedanism are of the
          highest excellence. Suffice it, that injustice,
          falsehood, pride, revengefulness, calumny, mockery,
          avarice, prodigality, debauchery, mistrust,
          and suspicion are denounced as ungodly and
          wicked ; while benevolence, liberality, modesty,
          forbearance, patience and endurance, frugality,
          sincerity, straightforwardness, decency, love of
          peace and truth, are, next to trust in God, and
          submission to his will, represented as the notes
          of true piety, and the principal marks of a true
          believer.</p>
                <p>The Koran (the Reading, that which ought
          to be read, pronounced Kooraan), which contains
          the revelations of Mohammed, is the basis
          of all the Mohammedan teaching ; but, among
          orthodox believers, it is supplemented by the
          Sunna, a voluminous series of moral and legal
          traditions, traced to Mohammed, recorded during
          the first three centuries of the Mohammedan
          era, and gradually formed into collections,
          which are accepted as canonical. As the
          inspirations which make up the Koran were given
          forth by Mohammed as circumstances prompted,
          they were necessarily fragmentary and unconnected,
          and the arrangement adopted when they
          were brought together was not one to give them
          continuity and coherence. Beginning with the
          longest, the several chapters were placed one after
          another in the order of their length. The book
          consists of 114 chapters, which have distinctive
          titles, many of them curious, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the Cow, Congealed
          Blood, the Fig, the Star, the Tower, and each
          begins with the formula, <q>In the name of God, the
          Merciful, the Compassionate.</q> The language of
          the Koran is of surpassing elegance and purity,
          and Mohammed himself did not disdain to make
          use of its literary excellence to bear out the proof
          of his divine mission. The matter is a curious
          jumble of poetry, narrative, doctrine about all
          things, human and divine, and pious ejaculations.
          No other book, however, has ever been held in
          such reverence among men as the Koran receives
          among Mohammedans. It is never even touched
          without previous purification ; its authority is
          sought in every difficulty ; sentences from it are
          everywhere displayed. The traditions recorded
          in the Sunna are given in the form of a dialogue,
          and are mostly very brief; and they deal with
          nearly every conceivable subject - religious doctrines
          and practice, laws civil and criminal, and
          the usages of common life. The Sunna became a
          badge of religious dissension soon after Mohammed's
          death ; but the division of the Mohammedan
          world into the two conflicting and bitterly hostile
          camps of the Sunnites (believers in the Sunna, the
          orthodox party) and the Shiites (sectaries), had
          its origin in the dispute as to the succession to
          the headship of Islam, which arose at Mohammed's death. The Shiites represent those
          who regarded Ali, Mohammed's son-in-law, as
          his rightful heir. This is still their principal
          peculiar tenet, and Abu-Bekr, Omar, and their
          successors in the califate are deemed by them
          to have been unrighteous usurpers. The principal
          Shiite people are the Persians ; the Turks are
          Sunnites.</p>
                <p>Were it not known that Mohammed had the
          assistance of a Jew in composing his revelation,
          internal evidence would shew that his obligations
          to the Jewish Scriptures and traditions were almost
          unbounded. He owed something to Christianity
          also ; and the amount of what he took over from
          the ancient heathenism of Arabia can scarcely be
          under-estimated. Originally, he seems to have had
          the idea of drawing around him Jews, Christians,
          and heathens, by borrowing freely from all of
          them - an idea abandoned when it proved unsuccessful.
          To form an estimate of his theology,
          as he ultimately shaped it, and of its influence on
          the races which have adopted it, is beyond our
          province. That its social polity tends to stereotype
          a low state of society, is clear enough ; and,
          in fact, the Mohammedan races have, in general,
          not been progressive. On the other hand, the
          flourishing state of arts and learning among the
          Arabs and Moors during the golden period of
          Mohammedan history, and many other facts, occur
          to warn us against forming sweeping conclusions
          on this subject</p>

                <head>HINDUSIM.</head>
                <p>What we have to attempt under this head is to
          give some account, not of a single religion and its
          varieties, but of the most distinctive features of the
          religious history of a strongly religious and highly
          speculative people. With religions which are not
          of native growth in India, and with the beliefs
          of various small fractions of the population of
          India, we are not here to concern ourselves.
          (Buddhism is treated apart.) But when these
          are put aside, what we find in India now is, not
          so much a religion as a group of religions, and
          a rather numerous group, connected by ties of
          history, by veneration for the same sacred writings,
          by powerful religious and social ideas which
          they have in common, but separated from one
          another by differences of a very important kind.
          And it is not only these, but the precursors out of
          which they have sprung, and from which they
          differ even more than they do from each other,
          that should be described under the name of Hinduism.
          The description must be defective, for it
          must be limited to the leading lines which appear
          in contemporaneous systems. To trace these with
          a fair approximation to accuracy is the utmost we
          can hope to do.</p>
                <p>At first sight it seems as if, among the Hindus,
          religion has shewn itself as mobile, as fluent, as
          among other races it has been stiff and unchanging.
          But Hinduism has a long history, and its
          history explains the apparent phenomenon. The
          mixture of many races in the population of India,
          of which one, a superior race, came gradually to
          dominate over the others, imposing upon them its
          religious and social ideas, is, at anyrate, the key
          to the most important of the changes which
          Hinduism underwent in its earlier period. Religions
          die hard, and the lower religions of the subjugated
          peoples forced important modifications
          upon the faith of the conquering race, the expositors
          of which, as a fusion of races made progress,
          found themselves compelled to accept, and as best
          they could to account for, numerous beliefs and
          practices entirely foreign to the religion of their
          ancestors. Once social change had gone so far
          that the Sanscrit, the ancient speech of the superior
          race, the language of their ancient sacred books, had
          become generally unintelligible, a powerful check<pb n="82"/>both upon development and upon corruption was
          gone. Growth and eclecticism thenceforth could
          pursue their course with much less hinderance ;
          and thus Hinduism, while still venerating the
          sacred books, and deriving itself from them, grew
          into systems with which they had scarcely anything
          in common.</p>
                <p>That the population of India, whatever the
          elements of which it is composed, is a mixture
          of numerous races, is beyond question, established
          by many different lines of evidence. Within the
          historic period there have been several irruptions of
          Tatar and Mongol races, who entered the country
          from the north-west. A multitude of facts point
          to the conclusion that, before the dawn of history,
          there was a succession of such irruptions from the
          same quarter. From the north-west appears to
          have come the conquering race whose stamp is
          still upon the social life of India, upon its institutions,
          its customs, and its language. The Arians, or
          Aryans, when we first have notice of them, were
          settled in the Punjab ; but they were a fair-skinned
          people, surrounded by dark races ; and from
          numerous other circumstances, it is evident that
          they were foreigners who had forced their way into
          the country. From their language, it is clear that
          they sprung from the same stock from which the
          races of Europe are derived. They seem to have
          gradually extended their settlements, first along
          the valley of the Ganges, and over Central India
          as far as the Vindhya Mountains, and at a later
          period into the Deccan. They reduced the populations
          which they conquered to strict subjection
          everywhere, and by their superior energy, both
          of body and mind, were gradually able to impose
          upon them their religious institutions and their
          language. Their language, the Sanscrit, it is true,
          took little hold in Southern India, but the chief
          modern dialects of Northern India are undoubtedly
          descended from it. The Vedas, their sacred
          books, are the scriptures from which Hinduism
          in all its varieties has ever professed to derive
          its doctrines. When first they come under
          observation, they had made no inconsiderable
          advance in civilisation. They were an agricultural
          rather than a pastoral people, and had
          made progress in many useful arts.</p>
                <p>Hinduism may be divided into three great
          periods, comprising respectively its early, middle,
          and modern phases, and these it will be convenient,
          for reasons that will appear in due course,
          to call the Vedic, Epic, and Puranic periods.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <head>THE VEDIC PERIOD.</head>
                <p>The Vedic period is so called because our
          knowledge of it is derived from the Vedas, the
          sacred writings, the divinely inspired liturgies
          of the Aryans. Hinduism in this, its earliest
          phase, was the religion of the Aryan conquerors
          of India. There are four Vedas, but of these the
          Rig-veda {<hi rend="italic">rich</hi>, praise, <hi rend="italic">veda</hi>, knowledge, from <hi rend="italic">vid</hi>,
          know) not only is the earliest, but is the original
          from which the others are derived. The others,
          indeed, are compilations founded on it, made each
          for a special purpose, the original being modified
          and added to as occasion required. The ritual of
          the Aryans seems to have grown in complexity,
          until the Rig-veda was found inadequate for purposes
          of worship, and more convenient liturgies
          had to be devised. The Yajur-veda and Sama-veda were the earliest of these productions ; the
          fourth, the Atharva-veda, is of later origin. The
          Sama-veda consists entirely of extracts from the
          Rig-veda, put together so as to suit the ritual of
          the Soma sacrifices or offerings. The Yajur-veda,
          though chiefly made up of extracts from the
          Rig-veda, contains additions, the Yajuhs (<hi rend="italic">yaj</hi>,
          sacrifice), prayers or thanksgivings, in prose, for
          use in sacrificing, which had become necessary,
          chiefly through the addition of new sacrifices, for
          which the hymns of the Rig-veda did not suffice.
          The Atharva-veda, which was used, not for the
          sacrifice, but for appeasing evil influences, for
          insuring the success of sacrificial acts, for incantations,
          and similar purposes, contains, as might
          be expected, a considerable amount of new matter.
          The Yajur-veda had the first place in practice,
          as being the liturgy through which the worshipper
          could most fully satisfy his sacrificial wants.
          All the Vedas alike are held to have been
          divinely inspired. Each consists of two distinct
          divisions - a Sanhita, or collection of mantras or
          hymns ; and a prose portion called Brahmana,
          (<hi rend="italic">Brahman</hi>, neuter), which gives injunctions for
          the performance of sacrificial acts, and explains their
          origin, and gives directions for the use of the mantras -
          the explanations being conveyed, and
          the directions accounted for, by means of legends and
          allegories, and sometimes also of mystical
          and philosophical speculations. The hymns of the
          Rig-veda seem to have been the production of
          many successive generations of families of Rishis,
          or seers. The directory portion of the Veda also
          must have been a growth of ages. Various conditions
          of society, various phases of belief, and
          even different periods of language, appear to be
          reflected in those writings. As to the dates at
          which the Vedas were put into their present
          forms, speculation has varied very widely. The
          twelfth century before the Christian era has been
          not without probability, assigned to the Rig-Veda,
          and there are writers who give it a far higher
          antiquity. But this, in the present state of our
          knowledge, is little better than conjecture, and all
          that can be confidently affirmed is, that the latest
          writings of the Vedic class are not more recent
          than the second century before Christ.</p>
                <p>The religious ideas expressed in the greatest
          number of the Rig-Veda hymns, if not very elevated,
          denote a simple and harmless faith. The
          objects of worship are the elements of nature personified -
          Agni, the fire of the sun and lightning ;
          Indra, the bright, cloudless firmament ; the Maruts,
          or winds ; Surya, the sun ; Ushas, the dawn, and
          various kindred manifestations of the luminous
          bodies, and of nature in general ; and they are
          worshipped purely in respect of the ability imputed
          to them to confer or withhold material
          benefits. The worshipper asks from them rain,
          food, cattle, health, or assistance against his enemies,
          addressing them with such arts as dependants
          use in begging favours from a superior.
          He complains to them of his troubles, and
          reminds them of the wondrous deeds they performed
          of yore, to coax them, as it were, into acquiescence
          and friendly help. Feeling no spiritual
          wants, he implores no spiritual blessings.
          Sin and evil are often adverted to, but a sinner
          is a man who does not worship the gods, or
          gratify them with the customary oblations ; most
          frequently he is the heathen borderer who perhaps<pb n="83"/>infests the territory of the <q>pious</q> man, and, at
          anyrate, is liable to the righteous vengeance of
          the worshipper and of his gods. The gods are
          spoken of as everlasting, and expressions occur
          which, taken literally, imply that the pious worshipper
          might obtain immortality by their aid;
          but there can be no doubt that, by this, length of
          life only is meant. Such a religion could have
          no dreadful or mysterious rites. The Aryans had
          no temples, and made no images of their gods.
          The one offering to the gods we hear of in this,
          which may be called the primitive stage of Vedic
          worship, consisted of the fermented juice of the
          Soma, or moon-plant, an exhilarating and inebriating
          beverage, which was deemed to invigorate
          the gods, and increase their beneficial potency.
          It was presented to them in ladles, or sprinkled
          on the sacred kusa-grass. Clarified butter, poured
          on fire, is mentioned in several hymns as an
          oblation agreeable to the gods ; and this also may
          have belonged to the earliest phase of Vedic
          worship.</p>
                <p>In another class of hymns to be found in the
          Rig-veda there is a departure from the simple
          conceptions of the early faith. The stirrings of
          new speculation begin to manifest themselves ; and
          the objects capable of propitiating the gods are now
          regarded as gods themselves ; Soma, the moonplant,
          and its juice, especially being invoked as
          the bestower of all worldly boons. The animal
          sacrifice, too, with properties ascribed to it more
          mysterious than those belonging to the simple
          media of the earlier worship, now appears among
          the established rites.</p>
                <p>A third class of hymns shews speculation advanced
          to a stage at which the mere worship of
          elemental powers could no longer be satisfactory.
          The worshippers had come to see a mystery beyond,
          and more mysterious than their gods, and
          to make their attempts at solving it. '<quote>Who
          knows exactly,</quote>' we find in one of these hymns,
          '<quote>and who shall in this world declare, whence
          and why this creation took place ? The gods are
          subsequent to the production of this world ; then,
          who can know whence it proceeded, or whence
          this varied world arose, or whether it uphold itself
          or not ? He who, in the highest heaven, is the
          ruler of this universe does indeed know ; but not
          another one can possess this knowledge.</quote>' In such
          utterances as these are the germs of the philosophic
          creed of the Vedic period, afterwards
          developed in the Upanishads, a class of writings
          the date of which is uncertain. Of these important
          works we can only speak very briefly.
          Their object is to explain, not only the process
          of creation, but the nature of a Supreme Spirit
          (<hi rend="italic">Brahman</hi>, as a neuter word, and therefore different
          from the same word as the first god of the
          Hindu trinity), and its relation to the human soul.
          In the Upanishads, Agni, Indra, Vayu, and the
          other deities of the Vedic hymns, become symbols
          to assist the mind in its attempt to understand
          the true nature of the one absolute being, and the
          manner in which it manifests itself in its worldly
          form. The human soul itself is of the same
          nature as this supreme or great soul : its ultimate
          destination is that of becoming re-united with the
          supreme soul, and the means of attaining that end
          is not the performance of sacrificial rites, but the
          comprehension of its own self and of the great
          soul. The doctrine which, at a later period, became
          the foundation of the creed of the educated
          - the doctrine that the supreme soul, or Brahman,
          is the only reality, and that the world has a claim
          to notice only in so far as it emanated from this
          being, is already clearly laid down in these Upanishads,
          though the language in which it is expressed
          still adapts itself to the legendary and
          allegorical style which characterises the Brahmana
          portion of the Vedas. The Upanishads became
          thus the basis of the enlightened faith of India.</p>

                <head>THE EPIC PERIOD.</head>
                <p>Our knowledge of this period is chiefly derived
          from the two great epic poems of ancient India, the
          Ramáyana and the Mahabhárata, and hence the
          name we have assigned to it. The Ramáyana appears
          beyond doubt to be the work of a single
          author, and the name of its reputed author is
          Valmiki. It ranks with the greatest epic poems of
          the world. Its subject is the history of Rama, one of
          the incarnations of the god Vishnu. The Mahabhárata,
          the main story of which narrates the conflicts
          of two rival families, descendants of a king,
          Bharata, is undoubtedly the work of many authors,
          and of different ages. It is greatly inferior to
          the Ramdáyana in excellence ; and, indeed, three-fourths
          of it is episodical matter, introduced at
          various times, and without regard to the motive
          of the work. The excrescences grafted upon it,
          however, add greatly to its general usefulness ;
          there is scarcely any subject of which it does not
          treat, and thus it may almost be termed an
          encyclopaedia of all knowledge, human and divine.
          It is evident that these poems must be of later
          date, by five or six centuries, than the earlier
          Vedas, but no date can be with confidence
          assigned to either. It may be surmised, however,
          that, at the latest, they were composed before the
          beginning of the Christian era. Changes in social
          structure, and changes in religious belief, both
          seeming to require a considerable time for their
          production, place a wide interval between these
          works and, at anyrate, the original Veda. In them
          we find descendants of the Aryan conquerors are
          masters of the greater part of India, the centre of
          their dominion being in the province of Oude ;
          they have brought the races which they have
          conquered to an acceptance of their religion ; they
          have made a new organisation of society, and
          given it the sanction of religion by ascribing to
          it a divine origin. What we have termed a new
          organisation of society, consisted in the classification
          known as caste. An institution of this kind,
          however, cannot have been created at a stroke ;
          it is well known that somewhat similar social
          divisions have arisen spontaneously among nearly
          every race of men ; and it is probable that among
          the Hindus, legislation only attempted to modify
          and give lasting form to divisions previously subsisting.
          It may be gathered that at no period was
          the attempt entirely successful. In the theory of
          caste, as laid down in the Institutes of Manu (a
          work of unquestionably great antiquity, from which
          much information as to Hindu life at this period
          is obtained), there are four primary classes, which
          were distinct at their very creation. First, there
          is the class of Brahmans, or priests, whose duty
          it is to read and study the sacred books, to conduct
          sacrifices, to teach, to act as lawyers and
          state-councillors. For the Brahmans, a species<pb n="84"/>of divinity is claimed. The poor among them are
          to be supported by the gifts of others ; and it is
          only when subsistence is impossible by other
          means that they may descend to military duties,
          or engage in certain kinds of traffic. Second
          comes the class of Kshatriyas, or soldiers, comprising
          priests and nobles. The third is the caste
          of Vaisyas, who are engaged in agriculture, in
          keeping cattle, and in trading. Widely separated
          from all these is the fourth caste, that of
          the Sudras, who are enjoined to serve the other
          castes, and are considered unfit for the higher
          rites and rewards of religion, so that it was an
          offence even to read the Vedas to a Sudra. The
          god Brahmâ, is believed to have created these
          classes for the functions assigned to them respectively,
          by causing them to proceed from different
          parts of his body - the Brahmans from his
          mouth ; the Kshatriyas from his arm ; the
          Vaisyas from his thigh ; and the Sudras from
          his foot. Nevertheless, other castes existed at a
          very early period, some of which may have been
          produced by intermarriages between the pure
          castes, and similar causes operating while the
          new classification was being consolidated, while
          others were probably the continuation of divisions
          of older date. A certain recognition was given to
          the mixed castes, and we find employments and
          handicrafts assigned to each. It is obvious that
          the Sudras were originally slaves - no doubt the
          descendants of the conquered native races. The
          superior castes, on the other hand, who were all
          alike regarded as <q>twice-born</q>, must have been
          mainly made up of the descendants of the conquerors.
          The institution of caste is unknown to
          the Vedas. The religious change observable in
          the Epic period is quite as remarkable as the
          social.</p>
                <p>Though we find the elemental gods of the
          Vedas still objects of worship, they have been
          ousted from their former rank ; they are now an
          inferior order of deities, exercising the office of
          <q>guardians of the world</q>. The chief place in
          Hindu theory is now held by the triad or trimurti,
          Brahmâ, Vishnu, and Siva, who represent respectively
          the creating, preserving, and destroying
          energies of nature. Temples and images have
          now become indispensable to worship. The Trimurti,
          when represented, is one body with three
          heads : in the middle, that of Brahmâ ; at its
          right, that of Vishnu ; at its left, that of Siva.
          Brahmâ, theoretically, is first and greatest of this
          trinity ; but his special function is that of creation
          ; he takes little or no part in the regency of
          the world ; and the result is that, as an object of
          worship, he gradually disappears - the philosophers,
          to account for this, declaring that he has
          become merged in the Brahmâ of their own speculation,
          the one primary, all-pervading spirit, of
          whom all things, including the greatest gods, are
          the manifestations. Vishnu and Siva are, in fact,
          the gods who divide between them the allegiance
          of the Hindus, and there is already noticeable
          a tendency among the worshippers of either
          to consider him the one god, of whom the other
          and Brahmâ were but passing forms. In the
          Ramáyana, the subject of which is an incarnation
          of Vishnu, the superiority of Vishnu is always
          assumed. In the Mahabhárata, we find a perpetual
          conflict as to which has the higher place.
          Inferior gods there now are almost beyond numbering, and they also are worshipped ; but the
          old Vedic conception of a god as everlasting,
          not subject to decay or death, is scarcely, or, at
          anyrate, not generally held applicable to them.
          Among the innumerable legends connected with
          the gods, those which describe the incarnations of
          Vishnu and other deities are the most remarkable ;
          and strange, indeed, is the conception of a divine
          providence which in these stories is presented to
          us. The accounts given of the creation of the
          world by Brahmâ, and of the four ages through
          which it has to pass, making a day of Brahmâ,
          at the close of which, all things are resolved into
          primary matter, and Brahmâ reposes for a night
          equal in length to the day, ready to begin anew
          the work of creation, and so on for a hundred
          years of such days - forming one of the wildest of
          those wild human imaginings called cosmogonies -
          also belong to this period of Hinduism. A minute
          and rigid ceremonial had sprung up along with
          the new theology, the most scrupulous observance
          of which was enforced by the sanctions of religion.
          It regulated not merely properly religious
          acts, but social life in almost every part. To
          comply with it without priestly assistance was
          impossible, and thus the Hindus of this period
          were probably the most completely priest-ridden
          people the world has ever seen.</p>
                <p>The philosophical creed of this period adds
          little to the fundamental notions contained in the
          Upanishads, though it frees itself from the legendary
          dross which imparts to those works a deep
          tinge of mysticism. But with the doctrine that the
          individual soul is of the same nature with the
          supreme spirit, and may be reunited with it, we
          find connected in this period two beliefs, which
          were destined to have great influence over future
          religious thought and practice. One was, that
          penance prepared the soul for reunion with
          God. The other was the doctrine of metempsychosis
          or transmigration of souls. Whatever
          its origin, it became connected with the view
          that in a single life it was impossible for the soul
          to attain to that purity without which it could
          not be reunited to the universal spirit. The soul,
          after death, must therefore be born again and
          again, until it has become purified from all taint
          of earth. The beginning of this doctrine may be
          found in some of the oldest Upanishads ; but its
          development into a system, with rewards and
          punishments proportioned to the deeds done in
          the last state of existence, and its rise to the
          position of a popular creed, belong to the Epic
          period. It pervades the legends of this period,
          and affects the social life of the nation. The
          Hindu ingenuity has worked out elaborate schemes
          of the forms of existence to which virtue may
          raise or sin condemn the unpurified spirit ; but
          into these it would scarcely be profitable to enter.
          Suffice it, that while eminent virtue may elevate
          a soul to a long life of bliss in Indra's heaven, and
          to the position almost of a god, an irreligious life,
          or even a single vicious act, if of enormity - for
          example, disrespect to a Brahman - may lead to
          ages of torture in a succession of hells, before the
          soul resumes its terrestrial migrations ; and that
          the soul may pass, as a punishment for sin, into
          the lowest animal forms, into vegetable existence,
          and even into inorganic matter.</p>
                <p>The strictly moral part of the Brahmanical
          system, which is contained chiefly in the book<pb n="85"/>called 
          the Institutes of Manu, is remarkable for
          purity and rigour. A complete system of ethics,
          it has been said, might be made up out of scattered
          moral sentences gathered from this work.</p>

            <div>
                <head>THE PURANIC PERIOD.</head>
                <p>The Puránas and the Tantras are the two
          classes of works on which the popular faith of
          modern India is founded, and from the former
          set of books comes the name we have applied
          to this, the modern phase of Hinduism. The
          Puránas are eighteen in number ; and while each
          of them appears to be held in special honour by
          one or another of the sects into which Hinduism
          is divided, they all have had for their paramount
          object to make out the claim to the rank of
          supreme god of either Vishnu or Siva. The Tantras
          are very numerous ; they are all the scriptures or
          text-books of the worshippers of the female energy
          of the god Siva. For the Puránas (the name signifies
          <q>old</q>), an age exceeding the period of history
          is claimed by the Hindus; but from internal evidence
          it is plain that in their present form they
          can barely claim an antiquity of a thousand years.
          The compilation of them is ascribed to Vyasa, the
          supposed arranger of the Vedas, and author of the
          Mahabhárata. The Tantras, by those who believe
          in them, are held to be of equal antiquity with the
          Vedas, and of superior authority. The antiquity
          ascribed to them is purely imaginary ; their date
          is involved in obscurity ; but they seem, at all
          events, to be later than the first centuries of
          the Christian era. In the Puránas, the legends of
          the older scriptures about gods and heroes are repeated,
          but with such modifications and additions
          as the purposes of the compilers required ; and
          the deeds of every god or hero are freely claimed
          for the particular deity whom it is the purpose of
          the work to exalt. Whatever memorable thing
          the old books reported of any other god, is
          ascribed to Vishnu or Siva, as the case may be,
          who, it is alleged, has taken a special form for
          the accomplishment of the particular act. The
          form of a Tantra is always that of a dialogue
          between Siva and his wife, in one of her many
          forms, mostly as Uma or Parvati, in which
          the goddess questions the god as to the mode
          of performing various ceremonies, and the mantras
          or prayers and incantations to be used in
          them.</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that the religious
          movement of Hinduism has been staid since the
          Puránas and Tantras became its most authoritative
          scriptures. On the contrary, there has been
          incessant change. But the leading divisions of
          modern Hinduism are still indicated by the diverse
          motives that have been ascribed to those writings.
          The triad, Brahmâ, Vishnu, and Siva, still
          remains the cardinal point in Hindu theory, but
          belief in it as it was originally accepted is completely
          gone. During the Epic period, the worship
          of Brahmâ had ceased. Then Vishnu and Siva
          were competing for the headship of the pantheon,
          but their separate godhood was scarcely doubted.
          In the Puranic period, the claim made for each
          of them excludes the other - annihilating him, by
          attributing to the one all that the other was
          formerly believed to have done. Vishnu and Siva
          are now each of them, in the belief of his worshippers,
          at once the creator, preserver, and destroyer.
          The claims made for them are often conveyed in
          language which seems to amount to a belief in
          one God ; all other gods and all nature are sometimes
          spoken of as forms of the deity who is being
          glorified. On the other hand, the existence of
          millions of other gods seems never to be really
          denied. But with Vishnu and Siva, the female
          energy of Siva has in the modern period divided
          the homage of the Hindus. Lakshmi, the wife of
          Vishnu, also, is worshipped, but only in association
          with the god. The idea that to each god
          belongs a female principle through which his
          energy is exerted, is obviously taken from the
          analogy of mankind, and accordingly the female
          energy of the god is popularly thought of simply
          as his wife. In the modern period, the <q>guardians
          of the world</q>, the elemental gods of the
          Vedic period, still retain their office and their hold
          upon the popular mind. Indra, the firmament, as
          the god who sends rain and wields the thunderbolt,
          and in whose paradise, Swarga, the inferior gods,
          and the souls of pious men have their abode, is a
          special object of adoration. The gods of inferior
          rank that are or have been conceived of as objects
          of worship are innumerable. The Hindus themselves
          enumerate 330 millions. But to count Hindu
          deities is like trying to count the objects in a
          kaleidoscope, for the same deity is known and
          worshipped under hundreds of names.</p>
                <p>Of the ideas implied by the Vedic rites, scarcely
          a trace is visible in the Puránas and Tantras.
          The conception of the nature and character of
          the gods is lower than it was in the Epic period;
          and as regards the popular faiths, we do not find
          much improvement as we advance towards modern
          times. The gods of the Puránas are much immersed
          in worldly affairs, and their divine character
          is nearly lost sight of in the narration of their
          transactions. In short, they are far from being
          exemplary or edifying personages. In the worship
          addressed to the leading gods throughout
          the modern period, great differences occur; but
          the practices attending it are more debased and
          cruel than those which are spoken of as prevailing
          in earlier times. The philosophical creed of
          this period, which is still the creed of the educated
          classes in India, is based on the belief in one
          supreme being, which imagination and speculation
          endeavour to invest with all the perfections conceivable
          by the human mind, but the true nature
          of which is nevertheless declared to be beyond
          the reach of thought, and which, on this ground,
          is defined as not possessing any of the qualities
          by which the human mind is able to comprehend
          intellectual or material entity.</p>
                <p>Amid the changes of theology, ceremonial has
          stood unshaken ; the Hindus of the modern
          period have submitted to the crushing burden
          which Brahmanical ingenuity devised for their
          ancestors. The ceremonial impurities in which
          he believes, and the commission of which he
          must avoid, keep the Hindu in perpetual fear.
          The institution of caste also remains, though
          greatly modified from the original theory. With
          the exception of the Brahmans, the pure castes
          have disappeared, and out of the intermixture of
          the others, innumerable classes have arisen ; while,
          except as to some of the holy functions of the
          Brahmans, the restriction of employments cannot
          be said to exist. Caste now acts chiefly in restricting
          people from associating together in such acts<pb n="86"/>as eating and drinking ; and the loss of caste is
          usually the penalty of some kind of ceremonial
          impurity, as associating with improper persons, or
          eating improper food. Caste distinctions, however,
          are so congenial to the Hindu mind, that
          the burden of caste, as now existing, is lightly
          borne. Even those who have lost their caste,
          the Pariahs, are said to form castes among
          themselves.</p>
                <p>Of the three deities who may now be said to
          divide among them the worship of the Hindus in
          all their sects, the name of Vishnu alone appears
          in the Vedas, but there he is only a representation
          of the sun, and though highly extolled, is represented
          as deriving his power from Indra. In
          the worship of Vishnu we have the more joyous
          and benignant aspect of Hinduism. The names
          under which he is chiefly worshipped are those
          connected with his incarnations or avatars.
          Though avatars are not entirely absent from the
          mythological history of Siva, they are specially
          characteristic of that of Vishnu. The god, it is
          believed, descended from time to time whenever
          a great disorder, physical or moral, disturbed the
          world, <q>in a small portion of his essence</q> upon
          earth, to restore order in the world, and thereby
          to preserve it. The form he assumed was that
          of some wonderful animal or superhuman being,
          or he was born of human parents in a human
          form, and he always possessed miraculous properties.
          Some of these avatars are of an entirely
          cosmical character ; others appear to be based
          on historical events, the leading personage of
          which was gradually endowed with divine attributes,
          until he came to be regarded as the incarnation
          of the deity. Besides the past avatars of
          Vishnu, one, it is believed, is yet to come. Ten
          avatars are generally enumerated, namely - 1.
          The fish-; 2. the tortoise-; 3. the boar-; 4. the
          man-lion-; 5. the dwarf-; 6. the Parasu-Râma-;
          7. the Râmachandra-, or, briefly, Râma-; 8. the
          Krishna and Balarâma-; 9. the Buddha-; and 10.
          the Kalki or Kalkin-avatar. The legends in
          which these avatars are related, throw a strong
          light upon the religious ideas of the popular
          Hindu creed. This will be seen from the one or
          two specimens of them which are all our space
          permits us to give.</p>
                <p>A powerful monarch, named Bali, had, by the
          practice of austerities and costly ceremonies,
          raised himself to the rank of Indra, and usurping
          the dominion of the three worlds (the sky, the
          earth, and <hi rend="italic">patala</hi>, or the under-world), he filled
          the gods with dismay. The gods implored the aid
          of Vishnu, but even Vishnu could not withdraw
          the power which Bali had, by legitimate means,
          obtained without his consent. He gained it by
          a trick. In the form of a poor Brahman dwarf,
          he appeared before the monarch, and begged of
          him a piece of ground on which to build a hut
          for himself ; and his request being granted, with
          three strides he compassed the three regions of
          the universe, and the power of Bali was gone.
          This is the dwarf-avatar. Again, as Râma or
          Râmachandra, Vishnu is the hero of the Râmayana.
          Râma, the son of the monarch of Oude,
          being banished by a court intrigue, had, with his
          wife Sita, to wander in the Deccan, then a savage
          region, under the dominion of demons (princes
          hostile to the Aryan race, no doubt). He made
          himself hateful to the prince of the demons,
          Rávana, who, out of revenge, carried off Sita to
          his residence in Lanka (Ceylon). Râma, with
          the monkey-hero Hanuman, and a whole army of
          apes, pursued him, and making a bridge across
          the straits to Ceylon, by throwing in mountains,
          overcame the demons, and recovered Sita. This,
          it may be observed, is probably a mythical account
          of the extension of the Brahman dominion and
          religion into Southern India. As Râma, Vishnu
          has numerous temples, where his wife, Sita, and
          the heroic monkey, Hanuman, are associated
          with him in worship. Let us now take the most
          famous and popular of all the avatars, in which
          Vishnu appears on earth in the form of Krishna.
          It being necessary to deliver the earth from a
          mighty demon, Kansa (a prince, most likely, of
          infidel or anti-Brahmanic tendencies), a portion
          of Vishnu descended into the womb of Devaki,
          the wife of Vasudeva, and was born in the form
          of man as Krishna. Kansa being informed that
          a child was to be born that would overthrow his
          power, and failing to catch the right one, Herodlike,
          ordered a general massacre of young boys.
          Krishna, the young god, however, had been sent
          away from Mathura, the capital of Kansa, to be
          educated in a pastoral district as the son of a
          cow-herd. While yet in the cradle, he performed
          feats of strength to which those of Hercules are
          nothing. As a child he delighted in playing tricks
          on his companions, and even on the god Indra.
          Grown up to be a youth, he captivated the hearts
          of all the milkmaids, and in his sports and dances
          with them, he so divided himself, that each of them
          believed herself the favoured partner of Krishna.
          Among many martial deeds he afterwards performed,
          was, of course, the destruction of the
          demon, Kansa, which had been the end of the
          avatar. Seven principal wives are assigned to
          him, besides 16,000 of less note, and he had
          180,000 sons. After a life full of adventure, he
          was killed by a hunter, and Vishnu '<quote>united himself
          with his own unborn, inconceivable, and universal
          spirit.</quote>' It is under the form of Krishna
          that Vishnu is most popular in modern India, and
          from what has been said of the life of Krishna,
          it need cause no surprise that the worship
          addressed to Vishnu, though characterised by
          much license, is, as a rule, free from terrible rites.
          It is fabled that the famous idol Jaggernaut (under
          the wheels of which multitudes of Hindus used
          to sacrifice themselves annually, in assurance of
          eternal bliss) was made to contain the bones of
          Krishna, and Jaggernaut (lord of the world) represents
          Vishnu as the dead Krishna. In this
          instance the worship differs much in character
          from that usually addressed to Vishnu in any of
          his forms.</p>
                <p>Siva, who, like Vishnu, is to his worshippers
          not only the greatest of gods, but the god wh
          comprises in himself all other deities, though his
          function in the triad was destruction, is chiefly
          regarded in modern times as the energy of reproduction.
          He is most commonly worshipped
          under the form of the lingam (the male principle
          in generation), emblematic of creation, which
          follows destruction. Of his multitudinous names,
          those in most frequent use are Isa or Iswara
          (lord) ; Rudra (the terrible), or Maharudra (the
          very terrible) ; and Mahadeva (the great god).
          His worship is more gloomy and terrible than
          that of Vishnu, and is characterised by bloody<pb n="87"/>sacrifices. His images have a terrific and repulsive
          aspect.</p>
                <p>The Sakti, or female energy, of Siva, now as
          prominent in Hindu worship as Siva himself, is
          worshipped under many names, but those most
          commonly applied to her are Devi, Kali, Durga,
          Parvati, Uma. In her worship we see Hindu
          religion in its most gloomy and disgusting form.
          She is worshipped with bloody and licentious
          rites. As Durga she is a kind of goddess of war.
          Her martial feats consisted in the destruction of
          a succession of demons who had conquered the
          gods, and expelled them from heaven. In commemoration
          of her victory over one of those
          demons, the most splendid and popular of the
          Hindu festivals, the Durgapuja, is annually celebrated
          in Bengal about the autumnal equinox.
          Three weeks later, another festival, called the
          Kalipuja, in honour of the goddess as Kali (that
          is, the black), takes place, to commemorate her
          victory over the demons Chanda and Munda.
          Here she is represented holding the severed head
          of Chanda in her hand, with the heads of his
          soldiers formed into a garland suspended from
          her neck, and their hands wreathed into a covering
          round her loins. She is styled the Black Goddess
          of Terror ; and her worship is based on the
          assumption, that she can be propitiated only by
          practices which involve the destruction of life.
          From the ritual of her worship, it is clear that
          human sacrifices at one time formed part of it;
          special directions are given how the victims are
          to be killed, and we learn that a sacrifice of three
          human beings will make her propitious for 100,000
          years.</p>
                <p>It is clear that, in the popular conception of
          Siva and of his Sakti, and also in the rites paid
          to them, Hinduism has borrowed largely from the
          aboriginal demon-worship, which still lingers in
          many parts of India. Such as it is, the worship
          of Siva is now the predominant worship of India.
          The followers of each of the leading Hindu
          deities are divided into sects, connected by
          the claim of supremacy which they make for
          the object of their worship, separated from each
          other by different views as to his character, or
          by the religious and other practices which they
          found on their belief, and distinguished from
          each other by the sectarian marks which they
          make upon their bodies. The diversities of belief
          and practice are especially great among the followers
          of Vishnu. A noticeable sect among the
          worshippers of Siva is that of the Yogins, who
          practise the most difficult austerities in order to
          ecome absorbed into the universal spirit, and
          thus liberated from future births. The word
          Yoga means concentration, abstract contemplation
          ; and the idea at the root of the Yoga doctrine
          is that, to become re-united with the universal
          spirit, the soul must become disentangled from,
          or completely indifferent to, all objects. This, it
          is believed, can be effected by means of selfinflicted
          penances. This belief, as we have seen,
          sprung up during the Epic period, and it is not
          now confined to the votaries of Siva, but it is
          among them that the practice founded upon it
          has been most thoroughly carried out. Continued
          suppression of respiration, painful and difficult
          postures, fixing the eyes steadily on the point of
          the nose - such are the practices by which the
          Yogins hope to secure re-union with Siva, whom
          they consider as the source and essence of all
          creation. The more devoted subject themselves,
          to penances far more trying than these, and such
          as almost seem too much for human endurance:
          piercing the side or tongue, and thrusting a heavy
          piece of iron or a live snake into the opening ;
          sticking the body full of nails ; sitting under
          a burning sun surrounded by fires ; swinging
          through the air suspended by hooks passed
          through the fleshy part of the back. The followers
          of Vishnu know an easier way to the same universally
          desired end of absorption into the supreme
          soul. Whoever worships Vishnu with
          wrapt devotion, makes him the object of all his actions,
          gifts, food, sacrifice, will be freed from the
          bonds of his actions, whatever they may have been,
          and will <q>go unshackled to share the essence of
          the god</q>. Here is something like a doctrine of
          salvation by faith, and in the Puránas this
          doctrine is carried as far as ever it was by
          Christian Antinomians ; faith in Krishna and entire
          dependence upon him making virtue unnecessary,
          and sanctifying any vice. The worshippers of
          the Sakti, or female principle of Siva, are mainly
          divided into two sects, distinguished from each
          other by the degree of impurity admitted in their
          religious rites.</p>
                <p>Besides regular priests, Hinduism has its monks or
          devotees to a religious life, whose lives are one
          endless round of ceremonies. The daily devotions
          of the lay Hindu vary with his social position and
          greater or less zeal. The favourite places for performing
          them are the ghats, or flights of steps with
          which the margins of rivers and of tanks are lined.
          There the Hindu performs his ablutions, offers water
          to ancestors, and invokes his favourite god. Many
          content themselves with merely making the marks of
          their sects on their bodies, and invoking the god
          with uplifted hands. These sectarial marks are
          made mostly with the ashes of cow-dung,
          mingled with the urine of the animal - an unguent
          or holy water of great virtue in all consecrations.
          Pilgrimages to sacred places (fountains, rivers,
          cities) and to religious festivals are prominent
          features of religious practice. A visit to Benares,
          which is emphatically the holy city of India, is considered
          to secure eternal happiness. A similar
          virtue is ascribed to the waters of the Ganges,
          The temples with which modern Hinduism has covered
          the country are often grand and elegant
          structures. Its idols, on the other hand, are mostly
          rude, grotesque, and hideous. This arises, partly
          at least, from their excessively symbolical character.
          No idea of sanctity is attached to them ;
          they are merely convenient emblems of the deity.
          The idols used in a procession are generally
          thrown away when the ceremony is over. It is in
          Southern India that the temples are grandest
          and most numerous. At Benares, which is in. 
          Northern India, there are still at least 1000 Hindu
          temples, though many were destroyed by the
          Mohammedans, or converted into mosques.</p>

                <head>BUDDHISM.</head>
                <p>The most widely received of all religions is -
          strange as it may seem - a religion without a God
          and which regards extinction as the supreme good
          for men, considering it, too, as a reward so blessed
          that few are ever able to attain to it. That such a<pb n="88"/>faith as we have indicated should here and there
          be found as the esoteric speculation of philosophers,
          would not be very surprising. Such a
          faith, however, is Buddhism, the creed of 480
          millions of men, more than a third of the human
          race ; the faith which, were truth to be decided
          by majorities, would bear the palm from all the
          religions of the world. The study of such a religion
          may be expected to abound in puzzles, in
          conceptions which, to the European mind, are so
          strange as to be well-nigh unintelligible.</p>
                <p>The great Eastern Peninsula, including Burmah,
          Siam, and the adjacent countries, Ceylon, China,
          Japan, Tibet, Central Asia, and Northern Asia,
          are the regions in which Buddhism now finds its
          worshippers. More than half of the immense
          population of China consists of its professed adherents.
          It has a considerable hold upon Japan.
          In the other countries named it reigns supreme.
          In Northern Asia, it is found as far west as the
          Volga, and it even extends into Lapland. From
          Hindustan, the land of its origin, it has almost
          disappeared, lingering only among the Nepaulese
          and some other northern tribes. Wide-spread as
          it is, our authentic knowledge of it is of recent
          date. Up to 1844, the most diverse opinions were
          entertained in Europe as to its nature and the
          date and place of its origin. It was the publication
          in that year of <bibl>

                    </bibl> that first supplied
          trustworthy information as to its history and doctrines. M. Bournouf's work was founded upon a
          collection of Sanscrit writings found about 1828,
          in Nepaul, by the British Resident there, Mr
          Hodgson ; these, regarded by the Nepaulese as
          their canonical works, having proved on examination
          to be Buddhist scriptures. These appear to
          be the texts from which the Buddhist scriptures
          of Tibet, Mongolia, and China have been translated.
          The books of the Ceylon Buddhists,
          written in Pali, though not translations, substantially
          agree with them, and seem to be a later version
          of the same traditions. Since M. Bournouf's
          work appeared, several valuable contributions to
          our knowledge of Buddhism have been made. A
          copious account of it, as it appears in Ceylon, has
          been given by <bibl>
                        <author>Mr Spence Hardy</author> in his <title>

          several Russian savants have devoted themselves
          to the study of the Chinese and Tibetan Buddhist
          books ; and a complete and elaborate digest of the
          whole subject has been given by Carl Friedrich
          Koeppen of Berlin, in two volumes, one on the
          Religion of the Buddha and its Origin, the other
          on the Lamaist Hierarchy of Tibet. The means
          of giving a circumstantial history of Buddhism
          are still wanting, but the outline of its history is
          no longer doubtful.</p>
                <p>It had its origin in the north of India, and the
          date of its origin, fixed by events in Indian history
          which have been chronicled by foreign historians,
          may be with confidence referred to the early part
          of the sixth century before the Christian era.
          That, as now received, it was of gradual growth,
          cannot be questioned ; and it has been doubted
          whether its alleged founder, whose history is overlaid
          with a mass of extravagant and incredible
          legend, was an actual historical personage. The
          most eminent, however, among those who have
          investigated this question, are satisfied that he
          was an actual person, and that there is more or
          less of truth underlying the wild accounts we have
          of his history. Assuming this, his name was Sarvarthasidda
          ; he was of the warrior caste, and was
          son of the king of Kapilavastu, a small state in
          the north-east of Oude. He is often called Sakya,
          from the name of his family, and Gautama from
          the name of the race of which his family was a
          branch ; and Sakya often becomes Sakya-muni, the
          recluse or sage of the Sakya family. According
          to the legend, his conception was immaculate, and
          his birth was attended with signs and wonders.
          In his infancy and boyhood, he was a prodigy in all
          kinds of acquirements, intellectual and physical.
          He early betrayed a disposition to retire from the
          world ; to counteract which, his father had him
          married to a charming princess, and surrounded
          with temptations to dissipation and self-indulgence.
          Twelve years spent amid the pleasures of a luxurious
          court, however, left him oppressed with the
          feeling that the best life can give is vanity and
          vexation of spirit. The thought of having to
          undergo the burden of existence through an indefinite
          series of changes, which the doctrine of
          transmigration presented to him, grew insupportable.
          He resolved to search for some way of
          deliverance from the misery of life, for himself
          and others. He fled secretly from his father's
          court, and began the life of an ascetic. This was
          when he was about thirty years of age. During
          six years, he subjected himself to every austerity
          practised among his countrymen. His austerities,
          however, proved as unsatisfactory as his pleasures.
          He returned for a time to a more rational way of
          life, and thereupon was forsaken by five disciples
          whom his severe asceticisms had drawn to him,
          and filled with the hope that they would, through
          him, receive enlightenment. At length, we are
          told, he seated himself under a tree, resolved not
          to rise up till he had seen the way to deliverance.
          Here he underwent unmoved a fierce assault from
          Mara, the god of sensuality, of sin and death, who
          set upon him with a whole army of monsters (by
          which may be understood the desires and passions).
          The temptation past, he remained immersed in
          contemplation, and at last he pierced the veil of
          ignorance, by means of which men are held in
          the toils of illusion, and that light burst upon him
          in which all things stand disclosed as they are.
          He comprehended the illusory nature of life, and
          was free from repetition of illusion. In comprehending
          that, he comprehended everything, and
          was become virtually omniscient. He remembered
          all his former transmigrations, and the
          transmigrations of all other beings. He saw at a
          glance the innumerable worlds. He perceived
          that concatenation of cause and effect which,
          determining all things, necessitates re-birth, and
          how the chain might be broken. He had
          attained to the perfect intelligence called Bodhi,
          and become Buddha, the being of perfect intelligence,
          the perfectly wise. The spot where this
          occurred, Bodhimanda, in Nepaul, is counted by
          Buddhists the centre of the earth ; and the tree
          under which the Buddha sat became an object of
          veneration to his followers, under the name of the
          tree of intelligence. He at once began to preach
          his new gospel, and he continued preaching it for
          forty-five years. Every spot where a Buddhist
          monastery was afterwards founded, claimed the
          honour of having been visited by him, and he is
          even alleged to have transported himself, by a<pb n="89"/>miraculous power he had, to places at which,
          without such power, he could not possibly have
          been. Thus he is believed to have visited Ceylon,
          where, on the top of a high mountain, the mark of
          his foot, as he took his departure, is pointed out to
          this day. But the range of his wanderings appears
          to have been not extensive, but confined to a
          hundred or two of miles eastwards and westwards
          of the modern Patna. He is represented as
          making everywhere prodigious numbers of converts,
          but this must be taken with great allowance.
          At last, at a place called Kusinagara, in Oude,
          not far from his place of birth, he died, or, in
          Buddhist phrase, sunk into Nirvana. His body
          being burned, the relics were distributed among a
          number of contending claimants, and monumental
          tumuli, called topes, were erected to preserve
          them.</p>
                <p>Little can be gathered as to the history of
          Buddhism during the two or three centuries
          following the death of its founder. A crisis in
          its fortunes arrived in the third century before the
          Christian era, when Asoka, a powerful monarch,
          who seems to have been master of nearly the
          whole of Hindustan, became a convert to Buddhism,
          and did for it what Constantine did for
          Christianity. Asoka made Buddhism the state
          religion of India. A council had been assembled
          to determine points of doctrine and discipline
          immediately after the Buddha's death. Another
          had been held about a hundred years later. In
          Asoka's reign, a third council was held, the object
          of which seems to have been to procure uniformity
          of doctrine and discipline among the Buddhists,
          who had come to be split up into many sects.
          The latest date that can be assigned to this
          council is 240 B.C. By this time, the art of
          writing was known. Inscriptions bearing the
          name of King Piyadesi, who, by most orientalists,
          is considered to be identical with Asoka - imbued
          with the spirit of charity and tolerance which,
          as will hereafter be seen, is characteristic of
          Buddhism - are still numerous in India. It is
          probable, then, though not certain, that at this
          council, the doctrines and precepts of Buddhism
          were written down - that it fixed the canon of the
          scriptures while settling the doctrine and discipline
          of the Church. At this council it was
          resolved to send missionaries of Buddhism all
          over India and the adjacent countries. It was
          now that Ceylon received the new doctrine ;
          Prince Mahendra, Asoka's own son, being the
          apostle. Cashmere and the countries about
          Cabul were converted about the same time.
          Under the governments which followed that of
          King Asoka, the history of Buddhism seems to
          have been somewhat checkered, but, on the whole,
          the religion continued to gain ground. About the
          beginning of our era, it had a second period of
          high prosperity under a king of the White Huns,
          named Kanishka, whose power extended from
          Bactria to the Punjab. From this region it seems
          to have extended through Central Asia into
          China, where, so early as 65 A.D. it was acknowledged
          as a third state religion. Its flourishing
          condition in Hindustan and the countries to
          the north-west of it, seems to have lasted from the
          time of Asoka (250 B.C.) to the seventh century
          after Christ. In the lands to the north-west of
          the Indus, it was exterminated by the fanaticism
          of the Mohammedans. How it died out in
          India is entirely unknown. In the 7th century,
          Hiouen-Thsang - one of a series of Chinese pilgrims
          to the native land of Buddhism, from whose
          accounts, covering several centuries, the most
          trustworthy part of our knowledge as to the
          state of Buddhism in India after the Christian era
          is derived - represents the religion as widely
          prevailing, and flourishing under the protection of
          powerful rajahs. By the 11th or 12th century,
          it had almost entirely disappeared. At what
          period Buddhism constructed those wonderful
          cave-temples which still exist in India, is only
          matter of conjecture ; but it is supposed that they
          were excavated in times of persecution, and probably
          during the early centuries of the Christian
          era. Of these excavations, about 900 are still
          extant. They are found chiefly in the presidency
          of Bombay.</p>
                <p>The canonical writings of Buddhism are divided
          into three classes, forming what is called the
          Tripitaka, or triple basket. The first class consists
          of the Soutras, or discourses of the Buddha ; the
          second contains the Vinaya, or discipline ; the
          third, the Abhidharma, or metaphysic. Though,
          as has been stated, the scriptures of the northern
          and southern schools of Buddhism are substantially
          the same, some differences both of theory
          and of practice have arisen between them. Into
          these we shall not be able to enter, nor can we do
          more than allude to the ecclesiastical hierarchy,
          known as Lamaism, which Buddhism has erected
          in Tibet. Our chief aim must be to make intelligible
          the intellectual theory on which the
          Buddhist system rests.</p>
                <p>Its view of the constitution and origin of the
          universe, Buddhism has taken from Hinduism,
          but with considerable variations. Besides this
          earth of ours, it holds that there are many worlds,
          so constituted as to cause almost endless degrees
          of misery or happiness to sentient beings placed
          in them. There are heavens, and there are hells ;
          and imagination has run riot in picturing the
          tortures endured by unhappy beings relegated to
          the latter. And as there are other worlds than
          ours, so there are other beings than our world
          can exhibit ; beings ranging from gods downwards.
          To such beings the gods of Hinduism and other
          religions may belong ; Buddhism is under no
          necessity of denying their existence. But it holds
          that every state of being, from the highest to the
          lowest, whether lasting for a day or for millions of
          years, lasts but for a time. The due time expired,
          every being dies and passes into another, possibly
          a far different phase of existence ; and so on
          everlastingly, except so far as the gospel of the
          Buddha shews a way of deliverance, at once from
          change and from being. The god then may fall
          from his high estate, just as that which has been
          a worm may be exalted. Buddhism taking from
          Hinduism the doctrine of the transmigration of
          souls, has applied it throughout the whole range
          of the universe. But if everybody and everything,
          even the gods, are subject to change, what
          power has created and guides the universe?
          Buddhism says it cannot tell ; or, rather, it
          attributes all the changes of the universe to
          what, for want of a better phrase, may be
          called the nature of things, or the order of
          nature, of which change is the settled characteristic.
          This world has sprung out of the
          ashes of a former world ; that out of the ashes<pb n="90"/>of an older world still ; and, on the other hand,
          this world also will decay, and will in turn be
          succeeded by another. An endless succession of
          worlds and beings, each produced out of that
          preceding it, because it and nothing else could be
          produced out of it - that is the Buddhist view of
          the universe. Consistent with itself, it does not
          affirm the eternity of matter. Nor does it affirm
          the existence of spirit in the sense which we
          attribute to it in distinguishing it from matter.</p>
                <p>It is the quality of the actions done during life -
          called, in the Pali language, Karma - that, in the
          Buddhist view, determines the state into which, at
          dissolution, a sentient being will be born, and it
          does so as by a natural law, a necessity working
          blindly ; such being the previous states, and such
          the actions, the next state can be no other than
          that which actually is entered upon. The ideas of
          reward or punishment in our sense, i.e. of a righteous
          judge who rewards and punishes, are not
          known to Buddhism. The theory which accounts
          for the succession of worlds, has also to account for
          the successive states of being. But the order of
          nature, according to the Buddhist view, is favourable
          to virtue, and, speaking generally, it is
          according as a man's deeds have been good or
          bad, that in his next state he is advanced or
          depressed, happy or miserable. A soul may be
          born in any part of the Buddhist universe, and
          may pass into any form. There are the hells for
          evil-doers, the heavens for the righteous ; and
          between the two, our earth, with all its varieties
          of life, animal and vegetable, and even its innumerable
          forms of dead matter, in any of which, for
          a degraded life, a being may have to dwell. Sometimes,
          it seems, a bad action may have no immediate
          effect, and may even remain latent during
          several existences ; but, sooner or later, it never
          fails to tell either upon the state of being or the
          fortunes of the doer.</p>
