                <p>Analysis of preface by Kawase Nagasada 河瀨長定</p>
                <p>Kawase Nagasada 河瀨長定 writes in the preface that China, although culturally superior, 
          has had corrupt officials who are unable to turn China from weak to strong, and to stand 
          against the Western powers that now put pressure on China. Kawase goes as far as calling 
          the “high officials asleep, the subordinate magistrates incapable” (dachen anmei, xialiao 
          beilou 大臣暗昧，下僚卑陋). Kawase thus criticizes the imperial governors, leaving little space 
          for any willingness by them to start reading Okamoto’s book. Being criticized this way in the 
          preface, it is doubtful if Zhang Zhidong and his subordinates would have looked into Okamoto’s book at all.</p>
