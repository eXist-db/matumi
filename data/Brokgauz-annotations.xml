            <p>Kawase Nagasada 河瀨長定 writes in the preface that China, although culturally superior, has had corrupt officials who are unable to turn China from weak to strong, and to stand against the Western powers that now put pressure on China. Kawase goes as far as calling the “high officials asleep, the subordinate magistrates incapable" (dachen anmei, xialiao beilou 大臣暗昧，下僚卑陋). Kawase thus criticizes the imperial governors, leaving little space for any willingness by them to start reading Okamoto’s book. Being criticized this way in the preface, it is doubtful if Zhang Zhidong and his subordinates would have looked into Okamoto’s book at all.</p>
