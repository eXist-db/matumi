        <head>ART</head>
        <div type="article">
          <p>, one of the forms of social consciousness, a component of the spiritual culture of mankind, a particular way of perceiving the world in both
            physical and spiritual terms. In this sense, various human activities are classified as art, including painting, music, the theater, and literature
            (which is sometimes classified separately, as in the expression "literature and art"). These artistic activities are all figurative reproductions of
            reality. In a broader sense, art refers to any useful activity that is performed skillfully not only in terms of technique but also in terms of
            aesthetic expression.</p>
          <p>Throughout history there has been strong disagreement concerning the definition of art and its role in human life. Art has been defined as the
            imitation of nature, the free creation of forms, the reproduction of reality, the self-knowledge of the Absolute, the artist's self-expression, and
            the language of feelings. Art has also been described as a special kind of game or prayer. These differences of opinion result from the dissimilar
            philosophical positions of theorists (materialistic or idealistic) and from differences in their ideological principles. The differences also occur
            because the theorists' views are influenced by the particular art medium (for example, literature or architecture) and style (for example,
            classicism or realism) with which they are concerned. A major factor giving rise to conflicting definitions of art and its role is the objective
            structural complexity of art itself.</p>
          <p>Some theorists, who are not aware of the complex and many-sided nature of art's structure, define the essence of art as gnoseological, ideological,
            aesthetic, or inventive. Dissatisfied with these and other one-sided definitions, some art scholars assert that art encompasses dissimilar yet
            organically related elements, such as the cognition and evaluation of reality, the reflection and creation of reality, or the reproduction and
            symbolic representation of reality. These two-sided interpretations also fail to fully describe the complicated structure of art.</p>
          <p>Scholarship has turned to systemic analysis in its study of the nature of art, which makes it possible to approach the problem from several
            different angles. Through this method of analysis, scholars wish to reveal those qualities and functions of art that are necessary and sufficient
            for the description of its intrinsic structure and to show that the union of these qualities and functions results not in a simple sum or mechanical
            conglomerate but in an organic entity that generates specific artistic effects. Scholars also strive to reveal the structural capacity of art to
            become modified, forming different genres and various historical types (for example, creative techniques, styles, currents, and schools). Although
            Marxist aesthetics is still far from a final solution of these problems, some of their specific aspects may be explained with sufficient
            definitiveness.</p>
          <p>As a result of the historical development of the division of labor, diverse branches of material and spiritual production, as well as various forms
            of human associations, have emerged from the originally integrated and syncretic activities of man. Unlike science, language, and other specialized
            forms of social activity called upon to satisfy various human needs, art proved necessary to mankind as a means of the integral social upbringing of
            an individual, assisting in his emotional and intellectual development. Art also serves to preserve an individual's contact with man's accumulated
            collective experiences and age-old wisdom, as well as with man's concrete social and historical interests, aspirations, and ideals.</p>
          <p>In order to fulfill the role of a powerful instrument for the socialization of the individual, art must resemble real life by re-creating
            (modeling) reality in all its integrity and structural complexity. Art must duplicate the experience of man and serve as its imaginary continuation
            and supplement. Art thereby expands man's experiences, making it possible for him to live many illusory lives in worlds created by writers,
            musicians, and painters. Art is both similar to and different from real life (this is the most important aspect of its dialectical nature).
            Inventive and illusory, like the play of the imagination, art is a creation of human hands. As <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach">L. Feuerbach</name> has noted, man's awareness of art as a handiwork is the principal
            difference from his attitude toward religion. <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name> expressed
            full agreement with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach">Feuerbach</name> on this issue <ref>{Poln. sobr.
              soch., 5th ed., vol. 29, pp. 53-54)</ref>. A work of art arouses profound emotions similar to those resulting from real experiences. At the same
            time, aesthetic enjoyment is invoked, stemming from the appreciation of a work of art as a model of life created by man. This contradictory nature
            can exist only if art is isomorphic to man's real experiences. In other words, art must not copy life but reproduce life's structure.</p>
          <p>Man's activities, which are organically integral, are made up of four primary interacting components—labor, cognition, value orientation, and
            communication. Correspondingly, works of art, which are in their own way organically whole, imitate the structure of man's activities. Primarily a
            specific means of apprehending reality, art also serves as a figurative method for the evaluation of reality and the assertion of a definite system
            of values. Works of art are created on the basis of the reflection and apprehension of the real world. However, man's consciousness of reality, in
            the words of <cit>
              <ref><name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name>, </ref>
              <quote>"not only reflects the objective world but creates it"</quote>
              <ref>(ibid., p. 194)</ref>
            </cit>, by creating that which has not existed in reality, does not exist, and, at times, cannot exist (for example, fantastic and grotesque
            images). Thus, art creates imaginary worlds that more or less resemble the real world and more or less differ from it. In other words, it
            represents, in the words of <cit>
              <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Marx</name>, </ref>
              <quote>a mode of "practical and intellectual assimilation" of reality, which differs from purely intellectual assimilation (typical of theoretical
                knowledge) and from purely material assimilation </quote>
              <ref>(K. Marx and F. Engels, Soch., 2nd ed., vol. 12, p. 728)</ref>
            </cit>.</p>
          <p>A work of art is always both a spiritual image of reality and a material structure, constructed from sounds, forms, colors, or words. An artist's
            final product is determined by the inherent properties of the medium with which he is involved. The structure itself serves a double role. It gives
            an artistic concept a material embodiment outside of which it, like any other model, cannot exist. In addition, it is a special artistic and
            figurative system of symbols, or a specific artistic language (for example, the language of music, choreography, painting, architecture, or
            cinematography), called upon to instill the artistic message that it contains in man's consciousness.</p>
          <p>Thus, art as a specific social phenomenon is a complex system of qualities with a structure characterized by a combination of cognitive,
            evaluative, creative (spiritual and material), and symbolically communicative elements (or subsystems). As a result, art serves as a means of
            communication among people and as a tool for enriching their knowledge of the world and of themselves. Art is a means of instilling in an individual
            a specific system of values and also provides great aesthetic enjoyment. Despite the fact that all these functions are but unified aspects of the
            single aim of artistic influence upon man, their relationships among themselves often vary greatly. Sometimes one function comes to the foreground
            and assumes primary significance.</p>
          <p>The artistic and creative activity of man develops in many forms, which are known as types (<foreign xml:lang="ru">vidy</foreign>), aspects
              (<foreign xml:lang="ru">rody</foreign>), and genres (<foreign xml:lang="ru">zhanry</foreign>). The abundance and diversity of these forms may seem
            to be a chaotic conglomeration, but, in fact, they constitute an orderly and organized, that is, a historically self-organized, system. Theorists of
            aesthetics have established that depending upon the materials with which artistic works are constructed, three types of art objectively evolve. The
            spatial, or plastic, arts—painting, sculpture, graphic art, photography, architecture, and applied art and design—develop images in space. The
            temporal arts, including literature and music, construct images that unfold in time but not in real space. The spatial and temporal arts, such as
            dance and acting (including all the arts based on acting—for example, the theater, the cinema, television, variety shows, and the circus), contain
            images that have extent, duration, materiality, and dynamics.</p>
          <p>Each of these three types of art may use various kinds of symbols. They use representational symbols, which presuppose a resemblance of images with
            sensually apprehended reality. Representational symbols appear in the so-called fine arts (painting, sculpture, and graphic art), in literature, and
            in the theater. Nonrepresentational symbols, which do not suggest visually any real objects, phenomena, or actions, are also employed. These
            symbols, as seen in architecture, applied art, music, and dance, appeal directly to the associative mechanisms of perception. The combination of
            representational and nonrepresentational images is typical of synthetic forms of art. Architecture or applied arts are often combined with the fine
            arts. Words and music combine to form song, and acting and dancing combine to form pantomime.</p>
          <p>Each of the three types of art is directly characterized by the particular method and by the type of image-bearing symbols used. Within the
            framework of these methods there are variations, which are determined by distinctive properties of the materials used and the resulting
            characteristics of the artistic language. Thus, variations of verbal art are oration and written literature. Music consists of both vocal and
            instrumental music. The theatrical arts comprise dramatic, musical, and puppet theaters, as well as shadow plays, vaudeville, and the circus.
            Variations of dance include social, classical, acrobatic, and gymnastic dances, as well as dancing on ice.</p>
          <p>Each type of art is broken down further into aspects and genres. The criteria of these divisions have been defined by scholars in various ways.
            However, it is evident that various aspects of literature are epic, lyrical, and dramatic literature. Aspects of the fine arts include easel
            painting, monumental painting, and miniature painting. The various genres of painting include portraiture, landscape painting, and still life
            painting. Among the aspects of the theatrical arts are tragedy, drama, comedy, and vaudeville.</p>
          <p>Art, when viewed as a whole, is a historically evolved system of various concrete and artistic methods of apprehending the world. Each of these
            methods shares common features with others. At the same time, each has individual and distinctive characteristics.</p>
          <p>Art originated during the Stone Age. Primitive man's earliest forms of artistic activity included the creation of myths, songs, and dances, the
            depiction of animals on cave walls, and the ornamentation of tools, weapons, clothing, and the human body. These activities were of enormous
            importance. They contributed to the strengthening of human collective life, developing primitive man spiritually and helping him to understand his
            social nature and his differences from animals. In other words, man's artistic activities served as an important historical agent of his
            humanization.</p>
          <p>At this early stage of development art was not an independent form of human activity. All intellectual production at this time was <cit>
              <quote>"directly interwoven" with material production</quote>
              <ref>(K. Marx and F. Engels, Soch., vol. 3, p 24)</ref>
            </cit>, and the various spheres of spiritual culture had not vet become differentiated. Correspondingly, art was inseparable from practical
            activities, religion, games, and other forms of human associations. Each of these activities was of an applied character.</p>
          <p> As culture developed, art gradually became a specific area of activity, it became <cit>
              <quote>"artistic production as such"</quote>
              <ref>(K. Marx, Soch. vol. 12, p. 736)</ref>
            </cit>. Nevertheless, many branches of artistic activity remained subordinated to religion for a long time. Some, to this day, have preserved
            indissoluble ties to different types of utilitarian activity. Architecture, design, and decorative applied art essentially fulfill technical roles.
            Essays and newspapers perform journalistic and informational functions. Oratory, posters, advertising, and decorative design are artistic forms of
            agitation and propaganda. Arts such as gymnastics and figure skating are forms of athletics. In all these cases, art enables the practical activity
            of which it is an integral part to have an emotional and psychological influence upon an individual. Having acquired its own formal distinction as
            an autonomous sphere of human activity, art did not lose its social character as far as its content, function and laws of development are concerned. </p>
          <p>Art will always appear in some system of culture. The historical development of art reflects the influence of a complicated combination of external
            impetuses, including the evolution of material production, the economic order of society and technology and the evolution of social consciousness in
            its ideological and subtle sociological and psychological manifestations. However, at the same time, the artistic development of man is relatively
            independent and its coordination with determining social factors is contradictory. As a result, the historical process of art is subordinated to the
            changes and struggles among various creative methods. Each of these methods expresses a particular aspect of the many-sided structure of art, giving
            prominence to one or another element. For example, realist methods sought, above all, an understanding of reality, whereas classicism considered the
            principal role of art to be the representation of an ideal world in which an established system of values is presented. No matter how closely the
            fundamental elements of art's structure are connected to a particular creative method, the method characterizes first and foremost the content of
            the work of art and the interpretation of reality as seen through the eyes of the artist, it also characterizes the means by which the content is
            given form, that is, the features of the style. The process of mankind's artistic development unfolds in two dimensions. One of its coordinates is
            the concept of method, the other is the concept of style.</p>
          <p>Expressing the needs of society and social development, art invariably attracts the attention of all social forces which are interested in
            influencing people—the state, classes, parties, and religious organizations. As a result, art is drawn into the orbit of class struggle, expressing
            the desires of either the people or the exploiting classes and espousing either social progress or reaction. It often embodies the most profound
            paradoxes and conflicts of social development. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">F. Engels</name> illustrated
            this by referring to the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">J. W. von Goethe</name> and <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honoré_de_Balzac">H. Balzac</name>, and <name type="person"
              key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name>, by citing the works of <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Tolstoy">L. N. Tolstoy</name>. Art also reflects the process of mankind's historical development and helps
            society to find direction and perspective in its movement toward freedom and toward forms of social life appropriate for man. </p>
          <p>Different economic and social formations support the development of art to varying degrees According to <cit>
              <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">K. Marx</name>, </ref>
              <quote>"capitalist production is hostile to certain branches of spiritual production for example, art and poetry"</quote>
              <ref>(Soch., vol. 6, part 1, p. 280)</ref>
            </cit>. Under the conditions of a developed bourgeois society, art is degraded to the level of merchandise, and creative work is subordinated to the
            laws of market relations. Art is divided into what is known as art for the elite and art for the masses, this division has a destructive effect on
            all concerned. The ideology of imperialism and the psychology of individualism pervert the nature of art in terms of both content and form. </p>
          <p>Under these conditions, only struggle against the faulty social relations of the bourgeois world can help art to overcome the pernicious influence
            of capitalism. It was for this reason that critical realism became the major trend in the development of art in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was
            also for this reason that <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name> in 1905, reflecting upon the
            development of proletarian art in bourgeois society, formulated the principle of communist <foreign xml:lang="ru">partunost</foreign>
            (party-mindedness). This principle joined the free spiritual lies of the artist with the revolutionary struggle of the working class, thus
            liberating him from the economic, ideological, and psychological pressures of bourgeois society. </p>
          <p>In socialist society, the role, character, and future of art are determined by the new social conditions of artistic development and by the
            spiritual needs of people on the path of communist construction. The October Revolution of 1917 freed the artist from the authority of
            commodity-money relationships. This assured him of the opportunity to create genuinely free work, addressed to all of the people. Through his work,
            an artist can strive to unify the people's feelings, thoughts, and will, as well as their spiritual and aesthetic upbringing. <name type="person"
              key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name> foresaw that under these conditions great communist art will be created in a
            new form corresponding to its new content <ref>(O literature i iskusstve, 1969, p. 666)</ref>. The method of socialist realism, which evolved during
            the development of proletarian and later, socialist art in the USSR and many other countries, is the concrete way of the realization of the Leninist
            program for the construction of the artistic culture of a communist society. </p>

                  <name type="place">Alpine</name> folding. The present landforms developed chiefly under the influence of the following factors: the ancient

                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neogene">Neocene</name> and <name type="periode">Anthropogenic periods</name>; and erosion of the elevated
                uplands, causing ruggedness at the periphery and a heavy accumulation of deposits in the basins which subsided or remained uplifted. The ancient
                planation surfaces have been best preserved in the interior portions of the uplands, as well as in the lower plateaus of <name type="place"

                the eastern edge of the continent was subjected to subsidence with an amplitude of up to 700 m). A great role was played by uplifts confined to

                structures were formed in all these areas, and the structures were broken by numerous intrusions of granite. Between the branches of the broad
                  <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> folded region are enclosed large median massifs (<name

                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> platforms</p>
              <p>The Alpine folding was confined to the enormous Alpine (<name type="place">Alpine-Himalayan</name>) folded region. Here, in the the <name
                  type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> Era, the <name type="place">Tethys geosyncline</name> stretched,

                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name>. In the area of Alpine folding, two (and in places three) series
                of convex folded mountain ranges can be distinguished; these draw closer together in some place and diverge at others. These ranges are a system
                of scales superimposed on one another or on the edges of the platform, or they are enor- mous anticlinoria of complex structure. The northern
                series of these anticlinoria form the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</name>, the <name

                  Caucasus</name>. The southern series of antichnoria include the <name type="place">Taurus</name>, <name type="place">Zagros</name>, and <name

                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</name> deposits and are frequently broken by slides. In the intervals between the zones of

              <p> Areas of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Late Cenozoic</name> and modern folding stretch along the periphery of

              <p>The extreme eastern periphery of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is occupied by a modern geosynclinal
                zone which separates the continent from the floor of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name>. It
                is formed by island chains (geoanticlinal zones), deepwater ocean troughs (geosynclinal trenches), and deepwater geosynclinal basins of the
                bordering seas. This zone is characterized by a very strong manifestation of modern volcanism, by high seismic action, by contrasting tectonic
                movements, by young folding, and by disturbances of the gravitational equilibrium.</p>
              <p>All the folded zones in the eastern part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> lying to the east of the
                Preriffean platforms and the modern geosynclinal zones adjacent to the ocean floor constitute the Asiatic sector of the circular <name

              <p>Thus, the Asian continent in its present form was formed comparatively recently. At the beginning of the <name type="periode"

              <p>The enormous extent of dry land and the abundance of mountain barriers and landlocked depressions create a great diversity of conditions for
                solar radiation, atmospheric circulation, and climatic features as a whole. A continental climate predominates over the larger part of <name
                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean"
                  >Atlantic</name> air, upon reaching <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, is transformed into continental
                air. Because of the westerlies and the isolating effect of the bordering ranges, the influence of the sea air from the <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> extends only to the eastern edge of <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. Arctic masses of air move freely into <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> from the north; and, in the summer, equatorial air masses predominate in the south. The
                latter's penetration into the interior regions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is limited by the ranges
                of the mountain zone extending from the west to the east. The contrasts between the strong warming of the land in the summer and its cooling in
                the winter cause sharp seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>.
                The winter cooling helps form a stable high-pressure area over north and central <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia"
                  >Asia</name>, with clear, frosty, and windless weather; maps of long-term average atmospheric pressure readings show a strong winter Asian
                anticyclone with a center over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolia">Mongolia</name>. The coldest temperatures are to be
                found in the northeast (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verkhoyansk">Verkhoiansk</name> and <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oymyakon">Oimiakon</name>), the cold pole of the northern hemisphere, where the temperature may fall to
                -70°C, with a mean January temperature of below —50°C. Along the periphery of the Asian anticyclone is a predominance of steady winds which
                bring dry and cold air from the interior regions of the continent; these are northwesterly and northerly in the east and northeasterly in the
                south (the continental winter monsoon). Because of episodic incursions of sea air from the east and southeast, the winter on the eastern edge of
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is warmer than in the central regions ofthe anticyclone.</p>
              <p>The boundary between the air of the temperate latitudes (polar) and the tropical air (the polar front) moves southward during the winter. This
                movement is related to the southerly shift in winter of all zones of general atmospheric circulation, as well as to the additional strong
                influence of the cooled land. Along the southern chains of the Southwest Asian uplands, the winter rains are related to this positioning of the
                polar front. In the more northerly regions of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwest_Asia">Southwest Asia</ref> and
                  <name type="place">Middle Asia</name>, the cyclonic activity on the polar front is particularly strong in springtime, causing the greatest
                amount of precipitation to fall in this season. During the summer the polar front moves to the north, causing cyclonic rains to fall in the
                mountains of <name type="place">South Siberia</name>. Masses of dusty, continental tropical dry air are formed over <ref type="place"
                  target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwest_Asia">Southwest Asia</ref>, <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia"
                  >Central Asia</ref>, and parts of <name type="place">Middle Asia</name>. Atmospheric pressure drops during the summer over all warmed <name
                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, particularly over its southerly part. On the charts of mean atmospheric
                pressure readings, the center of the summer Asian depression lies over the western part of <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name>. Along the southern periphery of the depression, the summer monsoon invades <name
                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, delivering abundant precipitation to <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name>, the southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas"
                  >Himalayas</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indochina">Indochina</name>. To the west, dry and hot air from
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Africa">North Africa</name> moves into the depression area. The aridity of the
                deserttropical climate of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name> and <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan">Pakistan</name> is related to this movement. <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia">East Asia</name> is under the influence of the <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> polar front during the summer. In the warm sectors of the cyclones which move
                here, warm and moist tropical sea air (the summer monsoon) moves onto land. The cooling of the sea air over the cold sea currents in the coastal
                regions creates fogs and drizzle. To the south of 38°N lat., where the warm <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kuroshio"
                  >Kuroshio Current</name> approaches the shores of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan">Japan</name>, the summer monsoon
                brings incessant rains and high humidity, with high air temperatures. In the autumn, close to the East Asian shores, the frequent tropical
                cyclones (typhoons) are accompanied by hurricane-force winds and downpours which, at their heaviest, often exceed the normal monsoon rainfall
                for the summer. During the winter the Pacific polar front is forced by the strong flow of Siberian air into the tropical latitudes. On the <name
                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia_Islands">East Asian islands</name> the effect of the winter continental monsoon is
                mitigated by the bordering seas. The monsoon is warmed while passing over the sea and picks up moisture, which during the winter is returned as
                precipitation on the northwestern slopes of the island chains. In the subequatorial portion of <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, continental tropical air prevails during the winter and equatorial sea air during the
                summer. The dry and warm winter winds of the southern Asiatic continental monsoon, which blow toward the equatorial depression, are analogous to
                the trade winds over the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name> and <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> oceans. The dry spring <pb n="4"/> is abruptly replaced by the rainy summer
                  (<q>"the monsoon outburst"</q>). The summer monsoon provides enormous amounts of precipitation (up to 2,500 mm a month). Over the equatorial
                parts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> (the south of <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka">Ceylon</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malacca">Malacca

                eqatorial air prevails, with an even course of high tempertures and abundant rainfall related to the intratropical convergence zone. The <name
                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Sunda_Islands">Lesser Sunda Islands</name> have a monsoon subequatorial climate; wet and
                dry seasons are subordinate to the calendar rhythm ofthe southern hemisphere— wet summer from November through February and a dry winter from
                May through August. (See Table 1)</p>
              <p>The mean January temperatures over a significant portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name> are
                below -20°C, reaching -50°C in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verkhoyansk">Verkhoiansk</name>. In areas close to the
                northern Asiatic coasts of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name>, the warming effect of the sea
                produces rises in temperature to - 15°C or even -5°C. The January isotherm of 0°C runs across <name type="place"

              <p>In the equatorial zone, around 2,000 mm of precipitations fall yearly, while 2,000-3,000 mm and more (in places, up to 8,000-12,000 mm) fall on

              <p>The Siberian rivers freeze over in the winter (some of them freeze down to the bottom) and flood widely in the spring. In the dry landlocked
                areas of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> only the transit rivers, which are fed by mountain snow and
                glaciers, have abundant water. These rivers reach peak flow rate and highest level in spring or summer (for example, the <name type="place"

                  Darya</name>). As a rule, other rivers in these regions have little water; the level changes sharply, and they dry up periodically or on
                occasion. The rivers in regions of the monsoon climate have their maximum water discharge in the summer. If not fed by snows in the mountains,
                rivers on the Mediterranean borders become shallow in the summer and sometimes dry up. In the equatorial regions the rivers have a great deal of

              <head>Soils</head>
              <p>In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> the entire gamut of soil types is represented, from the waterlogged
                low-humus soils in the arctic wastes to the red-yellow ferroallitic soils in the humid tropical forests of the equatorial latitudes. The change
                in soils from north to south is caused predominantly by temtemperature increase as one moves south and by changes in moisture conditions.</p>
              <p>Waterlogging caused by poor evaporation and bad drainage under permafrost conditions impedes the leaching of tundra soils and, combined with a
                brief, cold summer and poor aeration, leads to the incomplete disintegration of even the meager organic remains and to the development of
                reduction processes (gleization). The peat gley tundra soils were formed in this manner. The situation changes with an increase in temperature
                and precipitation to the south: intensely leached, acid soils of the podzolic series are formed under nonpermafrost conditions in the forests of
                the temperate latitudes; while taiga-permafrost soils are formed under permafrost conditions, including obstruction of leaching and of the
                interchange of matter under the effect of the freezing and unfreezing processes. Swamps and swamptype soils are widely found in the forested
                zone of the temperate belt.</p>
              <p>In the southern regions of temperate latitudes (in the central and western portions of <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>), the continuing increase of heat is combined with a diminution of moisture. For this
                reason, in these arid regions the leaching of the soils is weakened, and the ascending flows of the soil solution assume greater and greater
                significance. The soils become neutral and rich in bases, while significant quantities of humus accumulate in the surface horizons. In this
                regard, even on the southern edge of the forested zone (beneath the broad-leaved forests) the soils assume a darker tint (the gray forest
                soils), while chernozems form on the forest steppes and steppes with a rich grass stand. Further south, in the even more arid regions, the
                quantity of humus declines, the content of unleached mineral salts increases, and the soils become lighter. Here are the chestnut soils in the
                arid steppes, the light-brown soils in the semideserts, and the gray-brown desert soils in the deserts. In these regions salt bottoms and
                alkalis are widely found. In the humid regions of the temperate latitudes in <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia"
                  >East Asia</ref>, beneath the forest vegetation, brown forest soils are formed, while chernozem-like prairie soils, very rich in humus and
                often gleyed, are formed under the grassy, predominantly meadow vegetation.</p>
              <p>The substantial increase in heat with the transition from the temperate latitudes to the subtropical ones intensifies the chemical weathering.
                With a well-leached water system. this leads to the decomposition and loss of a significant quantity of mineral substances from the soil and to
                the residual accumulation of iron and aluminum sesquioxides (the process of laterization or ferrdallitization). This gives yellow and red tints
                to the soils of the humid regions in the tropical and even lower latitudes. In the humid subtropics red, yellow, and yellow-brown soils
                predominate. Brown soils associated with arid forests and brush predominate in the moderately arid regions, with gray-brown soils in the arid
                regions and gray desert soils in the semideserts. In the tropics the processes of laterization are intensified. Beneath the humid tropical
                forests there is a predominance of red-yellow ferroallitic soils. Red ferroallitic soils are formed under the savannas and dry tropical forests
                of the tropical and subequatorial latitudes; with an increase in aridity these soils turn into the red-brown and desert brown soils. In the arid
                savannas of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name> peninsula, the black soils called regurs are
                unique.</p>
              <p>In the river valleys, alluvial soils have developed; usually these are heavily cultivated, particularly in the subtropical, tropical, and
                equatorial zones.</p>
              <p>In the mountains the altitude-zoned series of soil types are represented; as a rule, these are skeletal and underdeveloped. Beneath the
                mountain forests in the north of the temperate zone, mountain podzolic soils and mountain variations of the gray-forest and taiga-permafrost
                soils have developed. Above the timberline these are replaced by mountain-tundra soils. In the southern temperate zone, beneath the mountain
                steppes, mountain chestnut and mountain chernozem soils have developed, and in the wetter (forested) regions there are brown mountain forest
                soils. Mountain meadow soils are found under the subalpine and alpine meadows. In the humid regions of the low latitudes the mountain red,
                yellow, and ferroallite soils predominate, and in the dry regions there are mountain brown, graybrown, and brownish-gray soils. The alpine
                steppe and desert soils of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref> have a number of specific
                features.</p>

                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> region and the <name type="place">Paleotropical</name> region. The <name
                  type="place">Paleotropical</name> flora developed under the conditions of a constantly warm climate and has maintained an exceptional richness
                of species inherited from the <name type="periode" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name> and <name type="period"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> flora. In this area plants exist now which were known in the <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> only in a fossil form (treelike ferns, cycas, ginkgoes, and others). The <name
                  type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> flora has been repeatedly impoverished during periods of cooling
                and glaciation and as a result of recent uplifts and the advances of seas. These conditions have made the flora more meager and uniform than the
                  <name type="place">Paleotropical</name> flora, an effect also aided by the present-day severity of natural conditions in the higher
                latitudes.</p>
              <p>The tundras are without forests. In terms ofthe composition of the flora and the degree of participation of various plant groups, these areas
                are shared between the arctic and typical groups—that is, moss, lichen, and brush tundras (dwarf arctic birch, dwarf willow, bog bilberry,
                cowberry, and so forth). One of the centers for the formation of tundra flora lay in the tundras of northeastern <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>, which were not subject to continental glaciation. For this reason, the tundras
                adjacent to the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bering_Strait">Bering Strait</name> are rich in species. The tundras are

              <p>To the south of the tundras stretches a strip of forest tundra in which tundra and thin-forest areas alternate. In northeast <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>, unique variants of forest tundra have developed, with significant areas of stunted

              <p>Taiga forests predominate in the broad forest area of the temperate zone, including the <name type="place">Ural-Siberian dark</name>,
                coniferous forests in the west (spruce, fir, Siberian stone pine, or cedar), and the Eastern Siberian light coniferous larch and larch-pine
                forests (Siberian and dahurian larch) to the east of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yenisei_River">Enisei River</name>.
                To the south of the taiga stretch mixed broad-leaved coniferous aspen-birch subtaiga and broad- leaved forests. In <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> the latter have been preserved chiefly in the <name type="place"

                are absent. These forests have a great variety of species and an abun- dance od endemics and relics (the so-called <name type="place"
                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchuria_(region)">Manchurian</name> flora). The forest zone possesses colossal reserves of wood and
                industrial raw materials as well as food and medicinal resources. The area of agricultural, land in this zone is small. The flora of the
                northern subzones of the forest zone developed from the flora from the preglacial forests of the temperate zone which retreated to the south
                during the glaciation period. This flora has forrhed as a result of the advancement of the forests to the north behind the retreating and the
                tundra displaced by the glacier. In areas where there was no continental glaciation, forests also occupied the territories which the tundra
                surrendered to them. In the refuges (shelters), which were protected against the influence of glaciation, the representatives of preglacial
                broad-leaved flora <q>"survived"</q> the ice ages. Some of these refuges were the <name type="place">Kolkhida-Lazistan</name> area in western

              <p>To the south of the forest zone extend the zones of forest steppes (meadow steppes) and typical steppes. The forest steppes are well evidenced

              <p>The fauna of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is the most pronounced continental fauna in the world. Here

                and fox). There are few endemic groups of a high taxonomic rank (flying lemurs, tree shrews, tarsiers, gibbons, and giant pandas). There are

                  key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quaternary">Quaternary</name> glaciations and recent vertical uplifts.</p>
              <p>Fauna varies by latitude and altitude. The most impoverished zone is that of the northern oceanic coasts and tundras. Here reptiles and
                amphibians are totally missing. Virtually all the birds are migratory (characteristic are the snowy owl, rock ptarmigan, willow grouse, ducks,
                swans, geese, several species of passerines, eiders, gulls, and black guillemots). The tundra is inhabited by the caribou, arctic fox, and
                common vole and by Cricedidae, while seals, walruses, and polar bears live along the coasts. The small number of different species contrasts
                with the abundance of specimens. This is very characteristic, for example, of the seashore colonies of birds. In the forest zone dwell the elk,
                deer (the caribou, and in the south the maral and the Manchurian red deer), roe deer, musk deer, brown bear, wolverine, lynx, sable, squirrel,
                Siberian chipmunk, blue hare, and forest bank vole, as well as moles, Pteromyidae (flying squirrels), and so forth. Many of them are hunted,
                mainly for fur. Characteristic among the birds are woodpeckers, jays, Siberian jays, nutcrackers, crossbills, and owls. The hazel hens,
                capercaillies, and black grouse are of importance for hunting. There are numerous insects which are harmful to the forests, including various
                carpenter moths, bark beetles, and Bombyx. The penetration of certain steppe fauna into the taiga has been related to the felling of the
                forests. Characteristic of the fauna of the steppes, deserts, and mountain steppes are the ungulates, including antelopes (saiga, the Persian
                gazelle, the goitered gazelle, and others), wild sheep and goats, and such carnivores as the snow leopard, cheetah, striped hyena, jackal,
                corsac, marbled polecat, and steppe polecat. The wild ass, Przhevalski's horse, and wild Bactrian camel have remained in very small numbers. In
                the tugais along the rivers dwell deer (Cervus elaphus) and jungle cats. Rodents are very numerous, including jerboas, susliks, yellow susliks,
                marmots, voles, hares, pikas, and porcupines. The common birds are the larks and desert jays, and the bustard, Egyptian vulture, and lesser
                kestrel, with pheasants in the tugais. The reptiles are extremely numerous and include lizards (agamas, Phrynocephalus, geckoes, monitors, and
                so forth); snakes, including the snake Taphrometopon llneolatum, the Levantine viper, the Eryx (a family of sand boas), Ancistrodon (a genus of
                pit viper), and the cobra; and several species of turtles. Certain insects (the locust and others) are economically harmful. The bites of
                numerous arachnids are dangerous (scorpions, karakurts, tarantulas, and solpugids). The wild yak, the addax, the dongo antelope, the Siberian
                wild dog, the snow leopard, the longtailed marmot (Marmota caudata), and species of mountain goats and sheep have survived in the alpine
                highlands of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref>.</p>
              <p>The broad-leaved forests of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia">East Asia</ref> contain the socalled
                Himalayan-Chinese fauna, rich in relic <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neogene">Neocene</name> forms. Here several genera
                of deer (including the Sika deer) have survived along with the goral and takin antelopes, the raccoon dog (which has been widely raised in the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">USSR</name>). yellow-throated marten, black bear, lesser panda, giant panda,
                and tiger, as well as the moles Moger robusta, many rodents, and (in the south) several species of apes. Of the birds the endemic fowl
                (pheasants and others) are of interest. Among the snakes and lizards, the Indo-Malayan species are common. Leatherback turtles are found clear
                up to the basin of the <name type="place">Amur River</name>. The tree toad and the giant salamander are interesting amphibians. The insect world
                is very rich, particularly in butterflies and beetles of the Lyctidae family. In the forests of the equatorial and subequatorial latitudes, the
                Indo-Malayan fauna predominates: the Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and wild ox (the banteng, water buffalo, and others); several species of pigs.
                antelopes, and deer; small deer; tapirs; various species of martens and viverrids (the mongoose and others); bears (black and the sloth bear);
                tigers and leopards (panthers). numerous rodents, bats (including fruit bats), tree shrews pangolins (two species), flying lemurs, and lemurs
                (relics of the ancient connections with <name type="place">Madagascar</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa"
                  >Africa</name>); and various species of macaques, gibbons, and, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indonesia"
                  >Indonesia</name>. orangutans. Birds are also abundant (broadbills, pittas. weaverbirds, peacocks, pheasants, hornbills, and man\ others), as
                are reptiles (crocodiles, large-headed turtles, several species of cobras, skinks, geckoes, constrictors, and the flying dragon—an arboreal
                lizard), amphibians (tree frogs and others), and insects (large butterflies, numerous ants, termites, and others). A mixing of faunas occurs on
                the boundaries of the zones. The animal world has been altered by human activity and has been sharply impoverished over broad expanses of
                eastern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Republic_of_China">China</name>, <name type="place"

              nation in the historical sense) that has evolved from the language of a nationality (<foreign xml:lang="ru"><hi rend="italic"
                >narodnost'</hi></foreign>) during the process of that nationality's development into a nation</gloss>. The intensiveness of this process
            depends on the rate and special conditions of the development of a nationality into a nation among various peoples.</p>
          <p>A national language is a system of several forms of a language - the literary language (oral and written), popular conversational varieties of the
            language, and dialects. In the course of the formation of a national language, the relationship between literary language and dialect undergoes a
            substantial change. The national literary language is the most important developing form of a language, it gradually supplants the dialects that
            dominated the earlier stages of language development, especially in oral communication. Under the influence of a literary language, the formation of
            new dialectal features comes to an end and a leveling of clear-cut dialectal differences occurs. At the same time, the literary language gains wider
            acceptance and application and its functions become more complex. The literary form of a language becomes dominant as a result of the increasing
            complexity and development of the national culture of a people. The literary language, basing itself on the language of the people, supplants
            written languages that are alien to the people, such as Latin in Western Europe and Church Slavonic in Russia. The national literary language also
            becomes the standard for oral communication, where previously dialect was dominant.</p>
          <p>An extremely important characteristic of a national literary language is its normalizing tendency. In order to satisfy the increasingly complex and
            diverse needs of society that arise from the development of literature, journalism, and science and technology, as well as from the emergence of
            various forms of oral speech, the syntactic system and vocabulary of a national literary language develop intensively and become enriched.</p>
          <p>In bourgeois society, the national literary language serves primarily the dominant stratum of society, that is, its educated classes. As a rule,
            the rural population continues to use dialects, while in cities, urban dialects compete with the literary language. In socialist nations, as a
            result of the democratization of society and the widespread dissemination of education, a uniform, normalized, universally accepted national
            literary language becomes the property of every member of the nation.</p>

          <p>, <gloss target="#NATIONAL_LIBERATION_REVOLUTION" rend="unmarked">a revolution developing out of a national liberation movement and aim at
              abolishing foreign domination, winning national independence, eliminating national and colonial oppression and exploitalion, and gaining a
              nation's right to self-determination and its right to establish its own nation-state</gloss>.</p>
          <p>National movements appeared in one form or another even in the precapitalist epoch, under feudalism. The national oppresion and national conflicts
            that gave rise to these movements were engendered by private property relations and exploitation. In the national movements of the precapitalist
            epoch, nationalities and national groups fought against foreign domination and defended their own existence (for example, the struggle of <name
              type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Slavs">the South Slavs</name> against the Turkish yoke, the struggle of <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Czechs">the Czech people</name> against their German masters and the struggle of <name type="people"

              >Georgians</name> against the Turkish and Persian conquerors).</p>
          <p>The capitalist epoch brought into being massive national movements of the people as a whole and the first national liberation revolutions. The
            formation and consolidation of nations (<foreign xml:lang="ru"><hi rend="italic">natsii</hi></foreign> nations in the historical sense) and the rise
            of national consciousness led to an abrupt sharpening of the contradictions between the foreign masters and the oppressed peoples and drew broad
            strata of the peasantry and the urban population into the struggle against foreign domination. The economic basis this process was the development
            of capitalist relations and the formation of a nationwide market. The national aspirations of peoples who did not have statehood or who had been
            deprived of it met with opposition from the exploiting classes of the dominant nations. This was true, for example, of the national aspirations of
              <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poles">the Polish people</name>, who had fallen under the yoke of <name type="place"

              type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ottoman_Empire">the Ottoman Empire</name>. As a result of the attempts to suppress the
            national aspirations of various peoples, national movements seeking self-determination emerged. Bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic, and antifeudal in
            character, they were led by the bourgeoisie, which subsequently took control of the new nation-states.</p>
          <p>Owing to the uneven development of capitalist relations national movements and national liberation revolutions developed at different times in
            different parts of the world. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and the first half of the 19th, nations were formed, national movements
            developed, and nation-states were created in Western Europe, North Amenca, and Russia (for example, the Dutch bourgeois revolution and the War of
            Independence in North America). In the second half of the 19th century, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>
            and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name> were unified, and nation-states <pb n="372"/> emerged in <name

              >Rumania</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbia">Serbia</name>. The struggle of the <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Czechs">Czech</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poles">Polish</name>, and <name
              type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finns">Finnish peoples</name> for independence also unfolded. <ref>According to <name type="person"
                key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name>, the wars between 1789 and 1871 in Europe were, for the most part,
                <quote>"indubitably connected with the most important <q>'interests of the people,'</q> namely, a powerful bourgeois progressive movement for
                national liberation which involved millions of people, with the destruction of feudalism, absolutism, and foreign
                      oppression"</quote><ref>(<bibl><title><hi rend="italic">Poln. sobr. soch.</hi></title>, 5th ed. vol 27, p 101</bibl>)</ref>.</ref>
            Observing that as a result of these national movements and wars the era of national liberation revolutions in Europe had essentially been completed,
              <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name> conceded that under certain conditions such movements might
            develop again. This proposition was confirmed during World War II, when the struggle of the European peoples against Hitlerism was, to a
            considerable degree, a national liberation struggle.</p>
          <p>During the 20th century national movements and national liberation revolutions have developed primarily in Asia, Africa, and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name>, which were for many centuries the chief regions for the expansion of the
            European powers and the building of colonial empires. After freeing itself from Spanish domination in the I9th century, <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> became subject to the US imperialists. At the turn of the 20th century, as
            capitalism entered the imperialist stage, the expansion of the imperialist states reached an unparalleled scope and acquired new characteristics.
            The colonial system of imperialism emerged. The tendency toward closer, supranational economic relations among peoples was promoted by the
            development of productive forces, the use of crude violence, and the enslavement of peoples. The countries of Asia, Africa, and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> became the objects of national oppression and exploitation by monopoly
            capital. In these countries the national liberation revolutions are a manifestation of the extreme sharpening of the contradictions between
            imperialism and the oppressed peoples.</p>
          <p>The national liberation revolutions in the colonies and dependent countries of the contemporary world differ from the national movements of the
            past in several important respects. They are antifeudal revolutions, but above all, they are antiimperialist revolutions—component parts of the
            world revolutionary process and an active force contributing to the destruction of imperialism. Closely connected with the struggle of socialist
            forces the national liberation revolutions are the objective allies of the socialist movement. The Great October Socialist Revolution opened the
            epoch of national liberation revolutions and linked the national liberation movements with the socialist revolution in practice. The development of
            socialism into a world system and the further deepening and intensification of the general crisis of capitalism led to victorious national
            liberation revolutions in the colonies and dependent countries and culminated in the collapse of the colonial system of imperialism. The socialist
            system gives powerful support to the national liberation movement and blocks military reprisals by the colonialists against the peoples who rise up
            in arms. <cit>

            </cit></p>
          <p>During the postwar period (1945-73) more than I.5 billion people have thrown off the colonial and semicolonial yoke, and more than 70 new nation
            states have emerged. With the existence of two world systems and a new relationship of forces in the world arena, the peoples enslaved by
            imperialism have won independence by nonmilitary means (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India">India</name>, <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</name>, and most of the African countries), as well as by armed struggle (for example, <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indonesia">Indonesia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeria"
              >Algeria</name>).</p>
          <p>Under contemporary conditions the national liberation movement is directed not only against particular colonial powers, but against the colonial
            system as a whole. At the same time, the imperialist powers, despite contradictions among themselves, coordinate their actions against the national
            liberation forces, relying on a common, worldwide strategy and often working in a united front.</p>
          <p>The main driving forces in today's national liberation revolutions are the working class—the most consistent champion of the national interests,
            social progress, and carrying the revolution through to the end—and the peasantry, which plays a significant role in the anti-imperialist liberation
            struggle. In the countries of Asia, Africa, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> strata of
            the urban petite bourgeoisie, the patriotic <foreign xml:lang="ru">intelligentsia</foreign>, and the army also play an active and important role in
            the national liberation struggle. These groups are often characterized by strong anti-imperialist and anticapitalist attitudes, and, as has been
            demonstrated by experience, under certain conditions they may take revolutionary democratic positions. The national bourgeoisie participates in the
            national liberation movement, often providing it with leadership. Profound economic and political contradictions between it and the colonialists and
            the foreign monopolies impel the national bourgeoisie to fight against these groups. However, fear of the masses, as well as narrow class interests,
            promote the tendency of the national bourgeoisie to compromise with imperialism.</p>
          <p>In the past the bourgeoisie usually led the national movement, the victory of which resulted in the formation of a bourgeois state. Under
            contemporary conditions, in a number of countries the possibility has arisen for the working class and the peasantry to lead the national movements
            and ensure their culmination in the creation of working people's states. This possibility has become a reality in a number of Asian countries. In
            colonial and dependent countries where revolutionary democratic forces lead the struggle for national liberation, the nation-states established
            after the victory of the revolution have chosen to develop along socialist lines.</p>
          <p>In the national liberation revolutions of the epoch of developing capitalism, the aim of national liberation was essentially achieved when a colony
            broke its political ties with the metropolitan country. Today, when foreign monopolies retain control over the economies of former colonies, the
            conquest of political independence does not free the people from their status as an exploited nation. Although the creation of a nation-state
            represents a victory for the people of the former colony, it fails to fulfill completely the goals of the national liberation revolution. Therefore,
            with the collapse of the colonial system, the national liberation revolution enters a new stage, the struggle for economic independence. A national
            liberation revolution <cit>
              <quote>"does not end with the winning of political independence. Independence will be unstable and will become fictitious unless the revolution
                brings about radical changes in the social and economic spheres and solves the pressing problems of national rebirth"</quote>
              <ref>(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> p 46)</ref>
            </cit>. As a rule, the contradiction between oppressed and oppressor nations takes the form of a conflict between politically independent countries
            and imperialism, leads to a deepening of the revolution, and results in its entry into the stage of fundamental social and economic transformations.
            This new stage of the national liberation revolution is associated with the question of the direction to be taken by the social and economic
            development of the liberated countries. The problem of social and economic progress becomes the main link in the revolutionary process.</p>
          <p>In many countries the struggle for national liberation has become a struggle against exploitative relations, both feudal and capitalist. In the
            present epoch capitalism cannot guarantee the nationally independent development of countries that have broken away from colonial domination, nor
            can it ensure sufficiently rapid economic growth. The noncapitalist path—that is, development toward socialism—provides the most favorable
            conditions for economic progress and corresponds to the interests of the majonty of nations.</p>

          <p>In exploitative class society the national question arises with the struggle of nations and peoples for national liberation and for the most
            favorable conditions possible for their social development. After the victory of the socialist revolution and under socialist society, the national
            question includes problems arising in the relations between nations and peoples and associated with the establishment of friendship and voluntary
            unification, consolidation of unity, and drawing together in every way on the basis of complete equality. According to Marxist-Leninist theory the
            national question is subordinate to the general question of the social and political advancement of society. Marxism-Leninism proceeds from the view
            that the most important aspect of the national question is the unification of the working people, regardless of their nationality, in the struggle
            against all forms of oppression and for a progressive social system.</p>
          <p>The oppression and exploitation of some peoples by others and the struggle for liberation began in slaveholding society and continued under
            feudalism. The national question became fully developed in the period of the decline of feudalism and the rise of capitalism, when nations were
            being formed. The question still exists and is manifested in the struggle against national oppression and in intrastate relations between nations
            and peoples. After the victory of communism throughout the world the national question will wither away completely with the merging and
            disappearance of all nations.</p>
          <p>The ideologists of the bourgeoisie who led the national liberation movement in Europe and the American colonies from the 16th to 19th centuries
            regarded the "principle of nationality" (the <q>"right to a nation"</q>) as the key to the solution of the national question. According to this
            pnnciple the creation of one's <q>"own"</q> national state was a necessity under any and all circumstances. <ref><quote>"One nation—one
                state"</quote> was the slogan of the Italian <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasquale_Stanislao_Mancini">Mancini</name>,
              the Belgian <name type="person">Laurent</name>, and the Russians <name type="person">A Gradovskii</name> and <name type="person"
                key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolay_Yakovlevich_Danilevsky">N Danilevskii</name></ref>. The principle of nationality transformed the
            national element into an absolute. However the principle was extended only to <q>"civilized"</q> peoples. The bourgeoisie used it to distract the
            proletariat from the class struggle and tried to divide <pb n="376"/> the working class by fostering nationalistic prejudices and inciting national
            animosities and hatred. Nonetheless, during the bourgeois revolutions and the formation of bourgeois national states the principle of nationality
            played a positive role in the struggle against the legacy of feudal fragmentation and national oppression. Under the conditions of premonopoly
            capitalism the formation of national states alleviated the national question in some cases.</p>
          <p>With the growth of capitalism into imperialism, the bourgeoisie in the major countries undertook more extensive colonial conquests, divided up the
            world, and abandoned the principle of nationality. The national question ceased to be only an internal issue and became an international one
            involving the emancipation of all peoples from imperialist enslavement. Having become an independent political force, the proletariat advanced its
            own program for solving the national question.</p>
          <p><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Marx</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">Engels</name> elaborated the basic principles of a genuinely scientific theory for solving the
            national question. They showed that national relations have a concrete historical character and are determined by the social and state system, the
            relationship of class forces within a country and in the international arena, and the national policies of the ruling classes. At the same time, the
            relations between nations and peoples affect social relations and the class struggle. In different historical periods, different aspects of the
            national question may come to the fore—for example, the struggle for political or economic independence or the problems of language and culture.
            Having revealed the social essence of the national movement, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Marx</name> and <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">Engels</name> emphasized that the interests of the proletariat demanded the
            liberation of oppressed nations and peoples. They gave primacy to the principle of internationalism in the slogan <cit>

              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">Engels</name> championed and spread the call for national independence for colonial peoples,
            whom they considered the natural allies of the proletariat in the revolutionary struggle. They asserted that after the proletariat had taken power,
            it must <quote>"bring independence as soon as possible"</quote> to the colonies.</p>
          <p>In 1896 the London Congress of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_International">Second International</name>
            passed a resolution in which the slogan of the right of nations to self-determination was first put forward as the political basis for solving the
            national question. However, the opportunistic leaders of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Second_International">Second
              International</name> ignored <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">Marx'</name> and <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">Engels'</name> directives demanding that the proletariat lead the struggle for the liberation
            of the colonial peoples. Thus, in practice, they opposed the principle of self determination.</p>
          <p>The theory of the national question was further developed in the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V.I.
              Lenin</name> and other Russian Marxists. <ref><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name> wrote many

            including <name type="person">E David</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heinrich_Cunow">G Cunow</name>, who refused to
            recognize the right of nations to self-determination, and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Bauer">O. Bauer</name> and <name
              type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Renner">K Renner</name>, who proposed the nationalistic theory of cultural-national autonomy.
              <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name> also opposed the views of leftists such as <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosa_Luxemburg">R Luxemburg</name>, who, in combating bourgeois nationalist concepts, claimed that the right of
            nations to self-determination is unattainable in the epoch of imperialism and superfluous under socialism.</p>
          <p>Scientific principles for the national policy of the revolutionary Marxist party were elaborated by <name type="person"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name>. In the Draft Program of the <name type="institution"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party">Russian Social Democratic Labor Party</name> (1902) he asserted that the
            right of nations to self-determination was the key to the national question. The main theses of his theory on the national question became the basis
            for the practical work and programmatic documents of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comintern">Comintern</name> and
            the Communist parties.</p>
          <p>Under capitalism there are two hislorical tendencies in the national question. The first is the awakening of national life and national movements,
            the struggle against all forms of national oppression, and the creation of national states. The second is the development and growing frequency of
            international relations in every form, the breakdown of national barriers, and the establishment of the international unity of capital, economic
            life, politics, science, and the world market. The first tendency prevails in the epoch of rising capitalism and the second in the epoch of
            imperialism <ref>(<bibl><name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name>, <title><hi rend="italic">Poln. sobr.
                    soch.</hi></title>, 5th ed , vol 24, p 124</bibl>)</ref>. Both tendencies are reflected in Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question,
            in its recognition of the right of nations to self-determination, and in its defense of the principles of the voluntary unification of nations,
            proletarian internationalism, and solidarity among the workers of all countries in the struggle against imperialism.</p>
          <p>In the bourgeois-democratic stage of development the national question is part of the general question of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and
            its solution is subordinate to the goals of that revolution (for example, the elimination of the vestiges of feudalism). When conditions are ripe
            for socialist transformations, the national question is part of the general question of the socialist revolution and the building of socialism. This
            does not imply any underestimation of the national question. The working class and its Marxist-Leninist parties are the most consistent fighters for
            the just resolution of the national question and are staunch defenders of the national sovereignty of all nations and peoples. The right of all
            nations and peoples to determine their own destinies independently is recognized.</p>
          <p>The right of nations to self-determination means that each nation is free to establish any of various types of relations with other peoples,
            including voluntary union in a single state, autonomy, federation, and even secession and the formation of an independent state. It also implies
            independent decision-making on all questions of internal organization, such as choice of social system and type of government. According to
            Marxist-Leninist theory, the question of the secession of a nation should be decided on the basis of whether it is feasible and useful from the
            standpoint of social development in general and the struggle for world peace and socialism. If one bears in mind that there are 2,000 nations and
            peoples inhabiting almost 140 states, it becomes evident that most nations and nationalities can solve the national question only within the
            framework of multinational states.</p>
          <p>In addition to the question of the formal (legal) equality of nations, Marxism-Leninism raises the question of their attaining actual economic and
            cultural equality. The cohesion, unification, and comprehensive drawing together of nations can be reached only by their total emancipation from
            national and social oppression and by the creation of the most favorable possible conditions for the development of each of them. This is the
            dialectics of the Marxist Leninist view of the national question.</p>

          <head type="alt"><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">History of the national question</hi></hi></head>
          <p> In the period of premonopoly capitalism the solution of the national question was associated with the national liberation movements, which
            originated with the formation of nations. The winning of independence by the British colonies in North America in 1775-83 hastened the formation of
            the North American nation, and the liberation of the South American colonies between 1810 and 1826 laid the foundation for the formation of the
            Latin American nations. Liberation from the Turkish yoke during the 19th century opened the way for the formation of the Greek, Serbian, Rumanian,
            and Bulgarian nations and national states. In Germany and Italy unification was the solution to the national question. Under imperialism, with the
            division of the entire world into a handful of dominant nations and a majority of oppressed nations, the striving for independence and national
            consolidation was suppressed by force.</p>
          <p>The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution opened the era of the social and national emancipation of the peoples of the world. The
            liberation movement encompassed all of Asia, Africa, and South Amenca. With the shift in the world balance of forces in favor of socialism after
            World War II (1939-45), there was an upsurge in the national liberation movement. In the three decades since World War II more than 70 new states
            have emerged. As a result of the efforts of the Soviet Union, which have been supported by the other socialist countries and by the <pb n="377"/>
            developing countries, the principle of self-determination has become a principle in international law. It is written into the <title
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Charter">UN Charter</title>, and it was included in the resolutions of the Bandung Conference of
            Asian and African states in 1955 and in the resolutions of the conferences of nonaligned countries in Belgrade (1961), Cairo (1964) Lusaka (1970),
            and Algiers (1973). For many oppressed peoples, the content of the national question changes after independence is won, when the national question
            becomes separate from the colonial question.</p>
          <p>Owing to problems inherited from colonialism and to the intrigues of the neocolonialists, the national question became the source of sharp conflict
            after independence in many Asian and African countries, including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nigeria">Nigeria</name>, <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus">Cyprus</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan"
              >Pakistan</name>. The boundaries of many new states inhabited by different nationalities and tribes were established without taking into account
            the ethnic factor. In many cases, the same ethnic group is found in two or in several different states, especially in Africa. Because
            self-determination proceeded not on a national basis but usually on a historic one (that is, within the former colonial administrative units) and
            because the nations were not fully formed, the processes of national consolidation in these countries are extremely complex. In a state made up of
            various ethnic groups, one or several nations may be taking shape.</p>
          <p>In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> the national question involves the relations between the
            population of European origin and the native or non-European population which consists of the Indians and some of the Negroes. The native Indian
            population is numerous in such countries as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bolivia">Bolivia</name>, <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecuador">Ecuador</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peru">Peru</name> and speaks its
            own languages and dialects. The still unassimilated part of the Negroid population (in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil"
              >Brazil</name>, for example) no longer has its own language. In some Latin American countries, including <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haiti">Haiti</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guyana">Guyana</name>, <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaica">Jamaica</name>, and <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinidad_and_Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</name>, the national question touches on relations between the
            population of African origin, which constitutes the majority in some countries, and other national groups, such as those of European or Indian
            origin. To some extent, the special historical characteristics of the formation of the Latin American nations, which are reflected particularly in
            the absence of rigid racial and ethnic barriers and a high degree of racial intermarriage, point toward the solution of the national question.
            Progressive forces in the Latin American countries believe that the solution of the national question lies in the establishment of national and
            racial equality, the granting of autonomy to the Indian groups prevailing in certain areas, the development of the languages and cultures of
            national minorities, and noncompulsory assimilation.</p>
          <p>In the 1960s and 1970's the national liberation movement entered a new stage. The struggle for national liberation in many countries began to grow
            into a struggle against exploitative relations both feudal and capitalist. Many newly emancipated peoples have rejected capitalism and are grappling
            with the tasks of noncapitalist development, or development toward socialism, which will facilitate and accelerate the solution of the national
            question.</p>
          <p>In the countries of advanced capitalism relations are growing worse between peoples who have lived in a single state for centuries (for example,
            the conflicts between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walloons">the Walloons</name> and <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flemish_people">the Flemings</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium"
              >Belgium</name> and between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Canadian">French</name> and <name type="people"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_Canadian">English Canadians</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada"
              >Canada</name>, the Irish question in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>, and the Negro
            question in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the USA</name>). The question of the unequal status and oppression of
            millions of foreign migrant workers emerged between the 1950's and the I970's in the developed capitalist countries, particularly in Western Europe.
            The intensification of national conflicts in the capitalist countries is connected with the aggravation of social antagonisms, the growth of
            national consciousness, and the impossibility of achieving a just, democratic solution to the national question under capitalism.</p>
          <p>Under socialism each nation develops comprehensively toward convergence with all other nations and fraternal mutual assistance among nations. A
            vivid example of this is the way in which the national question has been solved in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union"
              >the USSR</name>. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Empire">tsarist Russia</name>, which was called a <q>"prisonhouse
              of nations,"</q> the national question was very acute and was expressed in many ways. Some peoples sought the restoration of their lost national
            statehood. For others the national question was bound up with the colonial question, and for still others it involved the struggle for national
            equality. The first official documents of the Soviet government—the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decree_on_Peace">Decree on
            Peace</title>, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Declaration_of_Rights_of_Peoples_of_Russia">the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of
              Russia</title> and <title>the Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited Peoples</title>—proclaimed a number of principles as the basis of
            the national policy of the socialist state the right of peoples and nations to self-determination, equality, and sovereignty, the abolition of all
            national privileges and restrictions, the right of national minorities to develop freely; and socialist federation. The Soviet government recognized
            the independence of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland">Poland</name>, <name type="place"
              key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finland">Finland</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latvia">Latvia</name>, <name

              >Byelorussia</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ukraine">Ukraine</name>, all of which had been part of <name
              type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Empire">the Russian Empire</name>. The rights of the peoples who did not wish to secede were
            constitutionally guaranteed by Soviet power.</p>
          <p>To combat imperialist intervention and domestic counterrevolution the Soviet republics created a close political, military, and economic alliance.
            Somewhat later, considering the advantages of a large state, they raised the question of unification into a single multinational socialist state. A
            nationwide movement for unification led to the formation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the Union of Soviet
              Socialist Republics</name> in 1922. This outstanding event in the history of mankind confirmed the correctness of Leninist national policy. The
            party charted a course toward the accelerated economic, cultural, social, and political development of the national borderlands. The implementation
            of this policy was possible in practice because of the comprehensive assistance rendered to the formerly oppressed nations and nationalities by the
            more developed parts of the country, especially by the Russian people, and in particular by the Russian working class, which performed a truly
            heroic feat, making sacrifices in order to overcome the backwardness of the outlying national regions. The national republics received regular
            subsidies from the all Union budget. Socially and economically, the national regions developed more rapidly than the center of the country. For a
            long time their inhabitants were exempt from taxation, and national cadres were given highly preferential treatment in admission to educational
            institutions. Enormous opportunities for developing science and the national culture were extended to all nations and peoples, and they experienced
            an unparalleled flowering.</p>
          <p>Relations between the Soviet socialist republics are based on the principle of socialist federation, according to which each republic is a
            sovereign state. Thus, each republic is guaranteed both national statehood and membership in the union on the basis of the principles of democratic
            centralism, socialist federalism, and socialist democracy. If a nation or nationality cannot form its own union republic because it is too small or
            does not constitute the majority on the territory it occupies, the principle of socialist autonomy is applied. Under this principle, nations and
            nationalities may form republics, autonomous <foreign xml:lang="ru">oblasts</foreign>, or national <foreign xml:lang="ru">okrugs</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Thus, all peoples are guaranteed self-government and protection of their national interests, including the development of the national culture,
            national schools, and respect for the national customs and religion. In all aspects of social and political life citizens are guaranteed the use of
            their native language. All nations and nationalities have freely chosen Russian as the common language for countrywide communication and
            cooperation. For millions of Soviet peoples, Russian has become a second native language.</p>
          <p>Consistent adherence to the principles of the Marxist-Leninist national program has enabled the Soviet peoples to solve the national question
            inherited by them and to create a powerful multinational state that harmoniously blends the interests of the entire society with the interests of
            each nation and each people. The solution of the national question in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the
              USSR</name> is one of the most important achievements of socialism and has great international significance. A new historic community of
              peoples—<name type="people">the Soviet people</name>— has emerged in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the
              USSR</name> under the impact of various powerful unifying factors that include a single socialist economy, an internationalist Marxist-Leninist
            ideology, the common historical destiny of all the peoples and nationalities; and the joint struggle against imperialism, aggression, and
            exploitation and for peace and communism. The further drawing together of nations is an objective historical process. It is harmful to force this
            process ahead and absolutely impermissible to hold <pb n="378"/> it back. Either approach would slow down this progressive process and contradict
            the general line of development of Soviet society and the interests of communist construction. The socialist countries that emerged after World War
            II have, in practice, confirmed and supplemented the experience of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the USSR</name>
            in solving the national question. Principles such as socialist federation, socialist autonomy, and the legal and real equality of nations and
            peoples are being successfully implemented in the socialist states. A new type of fraternal intergovernmental relations has arisen in the socialist
            countries. However, the socialist system only creates the objective preconditions for the resolution of the national question. Its actual solution
            depends chiefly on the subjective factor—that is, on the policies of the parties providing the leadership of society. If a party abandons the
            Marxist-Leninist line on the national question and relaxes the struggle against nationalism and chauvinism and the effort to educate the workers in
            the spirit of internationalism, national problems may grow more intense. By deviating from Marxism-Leninism and the principles of internationalism
            and pursuing a policy of Great Han chauvinism, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_Party_of_China">the Communist
              Party of China</name> has greatly exacerbated national problems, both inside <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/China"
              >China</name> and among states of the socialist community.</p>
          <p>The tasks of building a developed socialist society and a communist society unswervingly dictate the need for the socialist nations to continue to
            draw closer together in every way, to increase their cooperation, and to expand the socialist division of labor among themselves. The obliteration
            of class barriers and the development of socialist social relations strengthen social homogeneity among nations, promote the development of features
            common to all of them, and contribute to the further consolidation of mutual trust and friendship. However, the obliteration of national traits is a
            prolonged process. In socialist society, when there is a correct class line in national policy, national differences do not lead to estrangement
            between peoples. When national problems and contradictions arise, they do not have an antagonistic quality and can be solved in a spint of fraternal
            cooperation in the interests of the country as a whole and of each republic and in the interests of socialist and communist construction.</p>
          <p><name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union">The CPSU</name> and the other fraternal parties in
            the socialist countries reject both the exaggeration and the dismissal of national characteristics. They consistently put into practice the
            principles of internationalism and resolutely combat survivals of nationalism, chauvinism, national particularism, and national nihilism, and they
            seek to promote the further cohesion of the fraternal peoples.</p>
