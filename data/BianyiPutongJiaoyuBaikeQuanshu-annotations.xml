                <p> Preface to the Complete Translated Encyclopaedia for General Education
                    
                    Nowadays, China is facing serious problems, because of the incompetent government, the decay of the people’ spirit, 
                    as well as external threats and internal strife. For this reason the intellectuals start reading books from Japan and the West, 
                    taking their history and experience as references, in order to make China more civilized and stronger. 
                    The contribution in the translation of Japanese writings into Chinese language by our scholars is highly recognized and appreciated.
                    Although it has been nearly forty years since we have started to read Japanese and Western books by founding Tongwenguan, Guang Fangyanguan and other related translating bureaus, 
                    we still cannot have a complete and clear picture. In order to make academic improvements, we have to learn as much as we can. Our reference and resources should be comprehensive and include various subjects from different fields. 
                    When we are equipped with general, common knowledge, then our study of disciplinary knowledge can go into depth, our civilization will become prosperous and strong, 
                    finally our nation will be flourishing. The experience of Japan and the West also tells us that we should not solely copy from others, but we should spend time and indulge in research; 
                    we should not only take all at one go but also focus on mutual proofs.
                    If China goes on as in the past, although our scholars know that we have to study common knowledge, without sufficient common knowledge, but we want to do study disciplinary knowledge, 
                    how can disciplinary knowledge spread its influence? However, what we obtain is copying from others at one go, how to do good research? How can we make mutual proofs? It would be difficult to rejuvenate our countrymen.
                    As I am not good at foreign languages, therefore I cannot contribute to the translation of the encyclopedia. My friend, Mr. Fan Zhenshi [i.e. Fan Diji], enlightens me with knowledge from Japan. 
                    He is a determined and talented person with good vision. It is Mr. Fan, who accepted the request from Huiwenshe, to translate the Japanese encyclopedia.
                    This encyclopedia is a great publication from Japan, which combines the essence of Asian and Western knowledge. As now it is going to be introduced to China, 
                    it will act as a supplement for what we already have, although there will always be limitations. No subject is missing, we can indulge in research; it will help to make mutual proofs. 
                    The scholar who reads it shall have no regret.
                    Translation has been very popular in China for nearly half a century. Translators like Mr. Fan with spirited effort have contributed a lot to our society.
                    After the Chinese translation of the encyclopedia is published, every patriot in China will take Mr. Fan as an example, so as to devote oneself to the benefit of our people.
                    Knowledge of politics, law, agriculture and industry is gathered and sorted, publications from Asia, Europe, Africa and America will be piled up together and  you can access all this knowledge with ease.
                    The more comprehensive the studies are, the finer our research will be. Our civilization will be strong and prosperous, eventually it will be the best among the five continents. 
                    The reason behind is the application of encyclopedias. I hereby give my best congratulations to Mr. Fan and his work.
