                        <p>This English edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia is a faithful
                    translation of the Soviet
                    national encyclopedia, unannotated and as true as possible
                    to the content and meaning intended
                    by the editors of the original edition in Russian.
                    The publisher and editors of this work do not
                    embrace the ideology or endorse the views expressed by the
                    Soviet editors and authors of the
                    Encyclopedia, nor do they believe it is meaningful
                    or valuable to its users in English for them
                    to comment on the material. Rather, the purpose
                    of this translation is to convey the scope
                    and point of view of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia
                    and to bring to scholars and others with a
                    serious professional interest in Soviet affairs
                    a primary source through which they can gain
                    a richer knowledge and understanding of the contemporary Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>The major value of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia lies in the
                    wealth of information about the
                    USSR and its peoples that has been previously unavailable
                    in English. Although the Encyclopedia
                    is general in scope, it naturally concentrates on the Soviet Union.
                    Every area of Soviet life is
                    systematically presented-history and geography,
                    industry and agriculture, science and technology,
                    fine arts, popular culture. The ethnic diversity· of the Soviet
                    peoples and their languages
                    and cultures are thoroughly covered. There are many
                    biographies of prominent cultural and
                    scientific figures whose achievements are not
                    well known outside the Soviet Union. The detailed
                    surveys of the constituent republics, oblasts, and cities
                    and towns not only reveal their history
                    and culture, flora and fauna, geology and geography,
                    but also outline the communications,
                    transportation, mineral, agricultural, and industrial
                    development of the USSR today.</p>
                        <p>Another value of the Encyclopedia is its consistent
                    statement of the Soviet point of view.
                    As the editors explain in the Preface to the
                    Russian-language edition, its purpose is to make
                    known the history, achievements, and goals
                    of the Soviet Union and other socialist nations.
                    The Soviet point of view is similarly reflected
                    in the descriptions of the history, economy, science,
                    and culture of all peoples and countries of the world.
                    The Encyclopedia also reflects the
                    state of the art in Soviet science and technology,
                    subjects of great interest to the world, and
                    serves as a guide to current Soviet thinking and research.
                    Through the Encyclopedia, the scholar
                    gains an insight into the thinking, goals, and values
                    of one of the major world powers.</p>
                        <p>We present here the entire contents of the Great
                    Soviet Encyclopedia except for certain articles
                    that can he classified simply as dictionary or
                    gazetteer entries. No article that in any way touches
                    on a Soviet subject or that adds to the general body
                    of knowledge available in standard reference
                    sources is omitted. In each volume we will indicate
                    which articles have been eliminated.</p>
                        <p>In some cases the Soviet editors have updated facts,
                    such as population statistics, death dates
                    in biographies, or name changes for places or companies.
                    These changes we have incorporated
                    into the articles. Where major updating has occurred,
                    that is, to the extent that the article has
                    been practically rewritten, we have inserted the word
                    <q>"updated"</q> at the end of the article, after
                    the reference number to the Russian text.</p>
                        <pb n="VI"/>
                        <p>We have used the Library of Congress transliteration
                    system throughout except for proper
                    names so familiar in English that to
                    transliterate them otherwise would mislead the user. The
                    bibliographies have also been transliterated
                    according to the Library of Congress system. For
                    works cited in text we have translated the titles
                    so that the full sense of the article will be preserved.
                    Wherever possible, important documents cited in
                    the text have been checked against
                    primary sources. In biographical articles,
                    dates in prerevolutionary Russia are usually given in
                    Old Style with the New Style date after it in parentheses.</p>

                    <div type="section">
                        <head>BIBLIOGRAPHIES</head>
                        <p>All bibliographies that appear in the Russian-language
                        edition of the Encyclopedia are fully
                        listed in the English edition. Bibliographic entries
                        follow the same order and are listed in the
                        same language in which they appear in the Russian work.
                        Those works that are written in languages
                        using the Latin alphabet are rendered as they are.
                        Languages in other alphabets are given
                        in the Library of Congress transliteration system
                        for that language or, if there is no Library of
                        Congress system, in the transliteration system
                        used throughout the Encyclopedia.</p>
                        <p>Names of authors whose works are translated into Russian
                        appear in the original language,
                        not in Russian transliteration.</p>
                        <p>This method of presentation is such that all entries
                        in the bibliographies can be checked
                        through the National Union Catalog. Therefore,
                        the spelling of an author's name may occasionally
                        differ from text to bibliography; this is because
                        in text the Russian-language edition
                        spells the names of all peoples of the Soviet Union
                        in Russian but in bibliographies sometimes
                        lists their works in the original languages.
                        Insofar as possible, the English edition transliterates
                        names in the bibliographies from the original
                        language into the Library of Congress system (or
                        the system used throughout)
                        and gives this variant transliteration in brackets.</p>
                        <p>The bibliographies are selective and serve as sources
                        for the authority of the article and for
                        additional information. They contain
                        suggestions for further reading, sources for historical and
                        current data, and sometimes further bibliographies.</p>
                        <p>Usually the structure of the bibliographies reflects the
                        structure and content of the article.
                        That is, general works are listed first,
                        followed by more specialized references. In long bibliographies
                        for articles dealing with Soviet views on broad
                        subjects, a system is generally followed
                        whereby the classic reference works of
                        Marxism-Leninism are given first, followed by works in
                        Russian or other languages of the Soviet Union,
                        then foreign language publications, and, finally,
                        reading lists. The entries may be arranged
                        alphabetically by author or chronologically; they may
                        also be listed under clearly defined subject fields.
                        On Western subjects, foreign authors are sometimes
                        listed first.</p>
                        <p>Bibliographies of articles on people are divided into two parts:
                        WORKS - that is, works written
                        by the subject; and REFERENCES - that is,
                        works about the subject. Under REFERENCES, the
                        publications in Russian are listed first,
                        then foreign works in Russian translation, and then the

                    <p>The third edition of the Bol'shaia Sovetskaia
                    Entsiklopediia is being published in accordance
                    with the resolutions of the Central Committee
                    of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the
                    USSR.</p>
                    <p>The second edition of the BSE, published in 51
                    volumes from 1950 to 1958, contained close
                    to 100,000 entries. The new edition will be more
                    complete, with over 100,000 entries planned,
                    but taking the numerous requests of BSE
                    readers into account, it will also be more compact.
                    Its size will be reduced to 30 volumes,
                    making it more accessible and convenient to use. The
                    major articles in the third edition have been
                    shortened, and a smaller type has been introduced
                    to make this reduction possible.</p>
                    <p>The program of the Encyclopedia is specified in the
                    resolution of the Central Committee of
                    the CPSU entitled <q>"On the third edition of the Bol'shaia
                    Sovetskaia Entsiklopediia."</q> The resolution
                    notes the considerable achievements of recent
                    years in encyclopedia publishing in the
                    USSR. The second edition of the BSE was
                    widely disseminated both in the USSR and abroad.
                    It was a systematic summary of knowledge in social
                    and economic studies and in the pure and
                    applied sciences and became a universal
                    reference work for the Soviet intelligentsia at large. The
                    past decade has seen the publication of
                    specialized encyclopedias in science, engineering, and
                    culture; work has begun on national encyclopedias
                    in the Union republics.</p>
                    <p>However, many articles in the second edition,
                    the first volumes of which appeared 20 years
                    ago, no longer correspond to the current
                    level of world and Soviet knowledge, nor do they reflect
                    the new and outstanding achievements in
                    the Soviet Union and other socialist countries or the
                    profound changes that have taken place in the modern world.</p>
                    <p>The third edition will reflect (1) the achievements
                    of worldwide historical significance in
                    economics, culture, and science which have been
                    made in the Soviet Union and other socialist
                    countries and which are based on the
                    advantages of the socialist system, the great revolutionary
                    and labor achievements of the peoples of the USSR,
                    and the guiding activities of the CPSU;
                    (2) the historical experience and current
                    level of development of the international communist,
                    labor, and national liberation movements;
                    the future development and basic problems of
                    Marxism-Leninism-philosophy, political economics,
                    scientific communism, and sociology - and the contribution
                    of the CPSU and other Marxist-Leninist parties
                    to revolutionary theory; (3) the radical
                    changes in the political map of the world,
                    the development of world socialism, the deepening
                    crisis of world capitalism, the disintegration
                    of colonialism, and the formation of new independent
                    states.</p>
                    <pb n="VII"/>
                    <p>The third edition of the BSE will show in greater
                    detail the political history and the development
                    of economics, social thought, culture, and contemporary
                    life in Asia, Africa, and Latin
                    America and the role of various classes
                    and social groups in national liberation revolutions. It
                    will focus on the facts, events, and phenomena
                    of recent and current history.</p>
                    <p>The Encyclopedia articles are to give well-reasoned,
                    scholarly criticism of the ideology of
                    today's defenders of the bourgeois order and
                    proponents of anticommunism, of right and <q>"left"</q>
                    revisionism, and of contemporary bourgeois teachings
                    in philosophy, sociology, history, and
                    aesthetics.</p>
                    <p>The problems of the political economy of socialism
                    and applied economics - automation of
                    production, improvement of systems for control
                    and planning, scientific organization of labor,
                    material and moral incentives, and increase of
                    efficiency of social production - will play an
                    important part in this edition.</p>
                    <p>The BSE will examine in depth the further expansion
                    of socialist democracy, the development
                    of the Soviet state and of Soviet law,
                    the improvement of the functioning of the state, and the
                    strengthening of socialist law and order and discipline.</p>
                    <p>It is the duty of the BSE to show the educational
                    and transforming value of our literature and
                    art; the regularly developing process of
                    rapprochement of the nationalist (in form) and socialist
                    (in content) cultures of the peoples of the
                    USSR; and the variety of styles and forms of socialist
                    realism in the creative work of Soviet writers
                    and artists and of progressive writers and artists of
                    other countries.</p>
                    <p>Particular attention will be paid to the highly
                    advanced trends which are a decisive factor in
                    scientific and technological progress. These subjects
                    will be treated comprehensively: radiochemistry,
                    radiation chemistry, petroleum chemistry,
                    polymer chemistry and technology, the
                    chemistry of heteroorganic compounds,
                    atomic physics, solid-state physics, radio astronomy,
                    geophysics, biophysics, cybernetics, nuclear engineering,
                    space technology, radio electronics,
                    computer engineering, instrument manufacture,
                    heavy engineering, other developing technological
                    fields, general biology, genetics, molecular biology,
                    biochemistry, radiobiology, space biology.
                    agricultural sciences, medicine, and other fields of science.</p>
                    <p>The new edition of the BSE will devote much space to the
                    philosophical problems of the
                    natural sciences, to the growing influence
                    of physics and chemistry on all branches of science
                    and technology, and also to the broad application
                    of mathematical methods to economics, sociology,
                    linguistics, and other fields of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>At the very start of their work the Chief Editorial Board and
                    the Advisory Board of BSE
                    turned to the general public for help. The entry list
                    of the present edition was sent to all the
                    Union republics, to scientific institutions,
                    to Party, state, trade union, and Komsomol organizations,
                    to industry, to unions for the creative arts,
                    to institutions of higher education, to publishing
                    houses, libraries, and museums, and to private
                    specialists in every field. Over 3,000 replies
                    were received, with more than 50,000 suggestions
                    for additions and deletions and for more
                    precise terminology. This permitted us to
                    improve the list of entries and add articles with
                    terminology reflecting the level of contemporary scholarship.
                    The Chief Editorial Board wishes
                    to express deep gratitude to all Soviet and
                    foreign organizations and a group of individuals
                    who sent in suggestions and comments.
                    We count on scientists and government and public figures
                    for future help and active participation in
                    the preparation and creation of the BSE.</p>
                    <p>The Chief Editorial Board also wishes to note the great
                    work done by the late editor in chief,
                    Academician B. A. Vvedenskii, in editing
                    the first volume and in preparing the entire third
                    edition.</p>

                                <p>The mountains are grouped in two large belts.

                                <p> The basic schemata of Asian topography were created by the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> and
                  <name type="place">Alpine</name> folding. The present landforms developed chiefly under the influence of the following factors: the ancient
                planation processes; the major vertical and horizontal movements of the earth's crust in the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neogene">Neocene</name> and <name type="period">Anthropogenic periods</name>; and erosion of the elevated
                uplands, causing ruggedness at the periphery and a heavy accumulation of deposits in the basins which subsided or remained uplifted. The ancient
                planation surfaces have been best preserved in the interior portions of the uplands, as well as in the lower plateaus of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syria">Syria</name>, and East <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>, which are covered by hard beds of rock (lava covers, sandstone beds, and so forth).
                The vertical movements of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neogene">Neocene</name> and <name type="period">Anthropogenic ages</name> were particularly great in <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref>
                (more than 4,000 m in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pamir_Mountains">Pamir</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tibet">Tibet</name>, and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas">Himalayas</name>;
                the eastern edge of the continent was subjected to subsidence with an amplitude of up to 700 m). A great role was played by uplifts confined to
                the areas of abyssal faults (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kopet_Dag">Kopet Dagh</name>, <name type="place">Fergana</name>), and to the areas of large folding (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tian_Shan">Tien-Shan</name>, <name type="place">Gissaro-Alai</name>).Because of intensive erosion, many ancient plateaus have been changed into deeply dissected mountainous
                regions. Deep gorges are to be found in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pamir_Mountains">Pamir</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tibet">Tibet</name>; gorges also slice through the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas">Himalayas</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kunlun_Mountains">Kunlun</name>, the <name type="place">Zapadnyi Saian</name>, the <name type="place">Stanovoe Uplands</name>, the <name type="place">Cherskogo</name> Mountains, and the marginal chains of the <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwest_Asia">Southwestern
                  Asian</ref> uplands. In many places, particularly in areas with an arid climate, erosion has carved out structural forms and stratification of
                varying hardness. Vast areas of <name type="place">Middle Asia</name> and <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref>, particularly in the basin of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yellow_River">Huang Ho (Yellow)
                  River</name>, are covered with loess. So-called badlands are widely found, and in the desert there are aeolian (wind) landforms. Karsl
                phenomena are found in regions where limestone and gypsum are located.</p>
                                <p>A solid mantle of Anthropogenic continental glaciers covered northwestern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>
                to the north of 60° N lat. To the east of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Khatanga_River">Khatanga River</name> (because
                of the greater dryness of the climate), only the isolated areas were subject to the mantle and mountain types of glaciation. In the remaining
                regions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> the landforms of old glacial origin are confined to the highest
                areas and to some extent to the mountains of medium elevation. Traces have been found of several glacial advances separated by warmer
                interglacial periods. Certain depressions (thalassic plains) are overlaid with marine deposits as a result of recent advances of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</name> and northern seas. Modern glaciation is characteristic of many
                mountains; the <name type="place">Karakorum</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pamir_Mountains">Pamir</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tian_Shan">Tien-Shan</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_Kush">Hindu Kush</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas">Himalayas</name> are renowned for their gigantic
                glaciers.</p>
                                <p>Permafrost is found in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> on a significantly greater scale than in other
                areas of the world. The permafrost has had a major influence upon the topography, soil formation, and water system. Permafrost ground is
                encountered down to 47° N lat. (that is, farther south than in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America">North
                  America</name>).</p>
                                <p>The role of volcanic phenomena has also been great in forming the topography of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. Volcanism created extensive lava plateaus and chains of young volcanic domes. Mantles of ancient lavas and bedded magma
                intrusions (traps) cover the stepped plateaus in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name> and <name type="place">Middle Siberia</name>. Large belts of young volcanic landforms and modern volcanism are confined to the particularly active
                chains of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia_Islands">East Asian islands</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kamchatka_Peninsula">Kamchatka</name> the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Philippines">Philippines</name>, and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Sunda_Islands">Greater</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Sunda_Islands">Lesser Sunda Islands</name>. Recent volcanism (continuing into the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quaternary">Quaternary</name>) is inherent to the <name type="place">Southwest Asian uplands</name>, the

                                <p>
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> consists of several large Pjrecambrian platforms which have not undergone
                folding since the end of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proterozoic">Proterozoic Age</name>, in addition to broad
                folded areas which extend between the platforms and partially run out into the sea. The major structural units of the first type are the <name type="place">Siberian platform</name> in the north, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sino-Korean_Platform">Sino-Korean</name> and <name type="place">South China platforms</name> in the east, and the <name type="place">Indian platform</name> and the
                platform of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</name> in the south and southwest.
                These were the ancient archicontinents of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. The folded zones which have
                developed between the platforms and the fractured portions of the platforms from <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name> (<name type="place">Caledonian</name> and <name type="place">Hercynian</name>),
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name>, and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</name> geosynclines have connected these ancient archicontinents into a single whole. The
                  <name type="place">Eastern European platform</name> has played an essential role in the geological history of the western portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. Folded structures of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains"/>Urals and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazakhstan">Central
                  Kazakhstan</name> were formed along the eastern edge of this platform at the end of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name>, and these structures linked <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> into the
                single continent of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eurasia">Eurasia</name>.</p>
                                <p>Participating in the structure of the <name type="place">Siberian Platform</name> are strongly dislocated metamorphic schists, gneisses, and
                granites of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> basement; outcroppings of these rocks are
                found within the <name type="place">Aldan shield</name> and the <name type="place">Anabar massif</name>. This basement is covered almost
                horizontally by rock from the sedimentary mantle of the platform. These deposits are marine Riffean (Upper <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proterozoic">Proterozoic Age</name>), <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ordovician">Ordovician</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silurian">Silurian</name>, continental <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</name>, and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permian">Permian</name> deposits, intrusive beds, and lavas and tuffs from the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permian">Permian</name> deposits and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triassic">Triassic</name> periods. Marine and continental
                deposits along the northern and eastern edges of the platform, from the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jurassic">Jurassic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cretaceous">Cretaceous</name> periods, are widely found. These
                deposits reach particularly great thickness in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verkhoyansk">Verkhoiansk</name> sag.</p>
                                <p>Within the <name type="place">Sino-Korean platform</name> are several shields and smaller massifs, with dislocated and metamorphosed Preriffean
                rock outcroppings on the surface. The largest of the shields are the <name type="place">Liaotung</name> and <name type="place">Shantung</name>
                shields. Major syneclises adjoin them (the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ordos_Desert">Ordos</name> in the west and the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_China">North China</name> in the central part of the platform). Here the basement
                has subsided deeply. In the syneclises, marine deposits have developed from the <name type="place">Riffean</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Lower Paleozoic</name>, and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous">Middle and Upper Carboniferous ages</name>, as well as continental <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permian">Permian</name> deposits and thick beds of continental <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> and, in
                places, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</name> rock.</p>
                                <p>Instead of shields, anteclises—that is, major uplifts on which the platform mantle has been preserved—have developed within the <name type="place">South China platform</name>. Because of this, little rock from the crystalline basement is found on the surface here. The <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Lower Paleozoic</name>, section is thicker and more complete than in the north.
                  <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triassic">Triassic</name> marine deposits have developed widely. The Szechwan syneclise
                is formed by beds of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jurassic">Jurassic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cretaceous">Cretaceous</name> continental rock.</p>
                                <p>The sedimentary mantle of the <name type="place">South China and the Sino-Korean platforms</name> has been strongly dislocated (linear folds,
                fractures) and in a number of places has been broken by ore-bearing intrusions of a granitoid composition. These platforms owe this feature to
                the effect of intensive tectonic movements which occurred at the end of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jurassic">Jurassic</name> and the beginning of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cretaceous">Cretaceous</name> ages in the
                adjacent western <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> zone.</p>
                                <p>The oldest area of the <name type="place">Indian platform</name>, which 
                                encompasses the greater part of 
                                the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name> peninsula and the 
                                island of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka">Ceylon</name>, is 
                                a <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> crystalline

                                the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name> system 
                                (from the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous">Upper

In the north the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> avement has been submerged beneath a bed of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</name> deposits which is thickest in the upper portion of the <name type="place">Ganges
                  Valley</name>, the <name type="place">sub-Himalayan depression</name>, and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indus_River">Indus</name> River basin.</p>
                                <p>The ancient basement of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name> is also composed of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> crystalline rock which outcrops over a large portion of the
                peninsular surface. In the north and the east its <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> basement
                has subsided beneath thick, horizontal or slightly disturbed beds of mainly continental <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name> deposits and marine sedimentary rock belonging to the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jurassic">Jurassic</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cretaceous">Cretaceous</name>, and <name type="period">Paleogenic</name> periods.</p>
                                <p>Areas of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proterozoic">Late Proterozoic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Lower Paleozoic</name> folding (<name type="place">Baikalides</name>, <name type="place">Caledonides</name>) border the <name type="place">Siberian platform</name> on south and the west. Folded structures of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proterozoic">Late Proterozoic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Lower Paleozoic</name> ages form the <name type="place">Baikal area</name>, <name type="place">Vostochnyi</name> and <name type="place">Zapadnyi Saians</name>, the <name type="place">Enisei Ridge</name>, the <name type="place">Kuznetsk

                  Altai</name>, the <name type="place">Khangai</name>, and the <name type="place">Tannu-Ola</name>. <name type="place">Caledonian</name> folding
                is also evident in central <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</name>, on the northern chains of the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tian_Shan">Tien-Shan</name>, and in the southeastern regions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Republic_of_China">China</name>. In all these regions, thick series of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proterozoic">Late Proterozoic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Lower Paleozoic</name> deposits have been greatly dislocated and broken by intrusions of inneous rock. In the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devonian">Devonian</name> period, in the zone of <name type="place">Caledonian</name> folding, a number of
                large cauldron subsidences formed, including the <name type="place">Kuznetsk Basin</name>, the <name type="place">Minusinsk Basin</name>, and
                central <name type="place">Tuva</name>. <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devonian">Devonian</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</name>, and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permian">Permian</name> deposits (chiefly continental) which filled these de- pressions were dislocated later, in the age of <name type="period">Hercynian</name> folding.</p>
                                <p>The <name type="period">Hercynian</name> folded structures, which resulted from tectonic movements in the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Middle Paleozoic</name> (<name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devonian">Devonian</name>) and the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Middle Paleozoic</name> (<name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permian">Permian</name>) ages, take the basic from of a broad arc. They take a north-to- east and meridional strike between the <name type="place">Eastern European and Siberian platforms</name> (the <name type="place">Taimyr</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ural_Mountains">Urals</name>), a north-to-west strike in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</name>. <name type="place">Salair</name>, and the southern <name type="place">Altai</name>, a latitudinal one in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tian_Shan">Tien-Shan</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolia">Mongolia</name>, and the western parts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Republic_of_China">China</name> (the <name type="place">Kunlun</name> and <name type="place">Nan
                  Shan</name>), and a north-to- east strike in <name type="place">Tung-pei</name> (Manchuria). Within the bounds of <name type="place">Western
                  Siberian Plain</name> and the <name type="place">Turgai depression</name>, the <name type="place">Hercynian</name> and more ancient folded
                structures continue be- neath a mantle of virtually undisturbed <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name>
                and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</name> deposits, and the strike of these <name type="place">Hercynian</name> struc- tures has been determined from geophysical data.</p>
                                <p>The <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> folding encompassed thick complexes of geosynclinal deposits
                of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Permian">Permian deposits</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triassic">Triassic</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jurassic">Jurassic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cretaceous">Lower Cretaceous</name> ages in the <name type="place">Verkhoiank-Kolyma</name> and <name type="place">Chukchi</name> areas of northeastern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, in the <name type="place">Sikhote-Alin' Range</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indochina">Indochina</name>. Folded
                structures were formed in all these areas, and the structures were broken by numerous intrusions of granite. Between the branches of the broad
                  <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> folded region are enclosed large median massifs (<name type="place">Kolyma</name>, <name type="place">Indochinese</name>, and others)blocks similar in their structure to the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Precambrian">Precambrian</name> platforms</p>
                                <p>The Alpine folding was confined to the enormous Alpine (<name type="place">Alpine-Himalayan</name>) folded region. Here, in the the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> Era, the <name type="place">Tethys geosyncline</name> stretched,
                separating two dis- tinct continents, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia_(continent)">Angaraland</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name>. In the area of Alpine folding, two (and in places three) series
                of convex folded mountain ranges can be distinguished; these draw closer together in some place and diverge at others. These ranges are a system
                of scales superimposed on one another or on the edges of the platform, or they are enor- mous anticlinoria of complex structure. The northern
                series of these anticlinoria form the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</name>, the <name type="place">Turkmen-Khurasan Mountains</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paropamisadae">Paropamisus</name>, the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_Kush">Hindu Kush</name>, and the ranges of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pamir_Mountains">Pamir</name> and <name type="place">Gissaro-Alai</name>. Stretching to the west of this
                system of ranges is still another series of folded structures, the ranges of <name type="place">Elbrus</name> and the <name type="place">Lesser
                  Caucasus</name>. The southern series of antichnoria include the <name type="place">Taurus</name>, <name type="place">Zagros</name>, and <name type="place">Makran ranges</name>, the <name type="place">Sulaiman</name> Range, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindu_Kush">Hindu Kush</name>, and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas">Himalayas</name>. In the folded ranges of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Burma">Burma</name> and the island of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sumatra">Sumatra</name>, the Alpine folded zone joins with the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> zone of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Late
                  Cenozoic</name> folding and the modern geosynclinal zone. The folded structure of the axial parts of the Alpine Age ranges was basically
                formed in the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> from <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> geosynclinal deposits, while the legs of the antichnoria are composed of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</name> deposits and are frequently broken by slides. In the intervals between the zones of
                anticlinoria lie synclinoria as well as uplifted median masses or depressions (the <name type="place">Kura</name>, southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Black_SeaBlack">Black
                  Sea</name>, and others) filled with slightly displaced <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quaternary">Quaternary</name>
                deposits and partially occupied by modern seas.</p>
                                <p> Areas of <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cenozoic">Late Cenozoic</name> and modern folding stretch along the periphery of
                the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> (western <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kamchatka_Peninsula">Kamchatka</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sakhalin">Sakhalin</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hokkaidō">Hokkaido</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republic_of_China">Taiwan</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Borneo">Borneo
                  [Kalimantan])</name> and in the <name type="place">Burmese-Sumatran zone</name>, with extensive formation of Neocene geosynclinal fragmentary
                beds containing oil pools. These areas are undergoing orogenic development now.</p>
                                <p>The extreme eastern periphery of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is occupied by a modern geosynclinal
                zone which separates the continent from the floor of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name>. It
                is formed by island chains (geoanticlinal zones), deepwater ocean troughs (geosynclinal trenches), and deepwater geosynclinal basins of the
                bordering seas. This zone is characterized by a very strong manifestation of modern volcanism, by high seismic action, by contrasting tectonic
                movements, by young folding, and by disturbances of the gravitational equilibrium.</p>
                                <p>All the folded zones in the eastern part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> lying to the east of the
                Preriffean platforms and the modern geosynclinal zones adjacent to the ocean floor constitute the Asiatic sector of the circular <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> tectonic belt</p>
                                <p>Thus, the Asian continent in its present form was formed comparatively recently. At the beginning of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name> (in the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambrian">Cambrian</name>, <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ordovician">Ordovician</name>, and partially the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silurian">Silurian</name>), the <name type="place">Eastern European</name>, <name type="place">Siberian</name>, <name type="place">Sino-Korean</name>, and the <name type="place">Southern Chinese platforms</name> were areas of dry land
                or broad shelf areas covered by shallow epicontinental seas. The <name type="place">Indian platform</name> and the platform of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</name> were part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gondwana">Gondwanaland</name>, the largest southern continent of those times.

                                <p>The enormous extent of dry land and the abundance of mountain barriers and landlocked depressions create a great diversity of conditions for
                solar radiation, atmospheric circulation, and climatic features as a whole. A continental climate predominates over the larger part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name> air, upon reaching <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, is transformed into continental
                air. Because of the westerlies and the isolating effect of the bordering ranges, the influence of the sea air from the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> extends only to the eastern edge of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. Arctic masses of air move freely into <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> from the north; and, in the summer, equatorial air masses predominate in the south. The
                latter's penetration into the interior regions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is limited by the ranges
                of the mountain zone extending from the west to the east. The contrasts between the strong warming of the land in the summer and its cooling in
                the winter cause sharp seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>.
                The winter cooling helps form a stable high-pressure area over north and central <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, with clear, frosty, and windless weather; maps of long-term average atmospheric pressure readings show a strong winter Asian
                anticyclone with a center over <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolia">Mongolia</name>. The coldest temperatures are to be
                found in the northeast (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Verkhoyansk">Verkhoiansk</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oymyakon">Oimiakon</name>), the cold pole of the northern hemisphere, where the temperature may fall to
                -70°C, with a mean January temperature of below —50°C. Along the periphery of the Asian anticyclone is a predominance of steady winds which
                bring dry and cold air from the interior regions of the continent; these are northwesterly and northerly in the east and northeasterly in the
                south (the continental winter monsoon). Because of episodic incursions of sea air from the east and southeast, the winter on the eastern edge of
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is warmer than in the central regions ofthe anticyclone.</p>
                                <p>The boundary between the air of the temperate latitudes (polar) and the tropical air (the polar front) moves southward during the winter. This
                movement is related to the southerly shift in winter of all zones of general atmospheric circulation, as well as to the additional strong
                influence of the cooled land. Along the southern chains of the Southwest Asian uplands, the winter rains are related to this positioning of the
                polar front. In the more northerly regions of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwest_Asia">Southwest Asia</ref> and
                  <name type="place">Middle Asia</name>, the cyclonic activity on the polar front is particularly strong in springtime, causing the greatest
                amount of precipitation to fall in this season. During the summer the polar front moves to the north, causing cyclonic rains to fall in the
                mountains of <name type="place">South Siberia</name>. Masses of dusty, continental tropical dry air are formed over <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwest_Asia">Southwest Asia</ref>, <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref>, and parts of <name type="place">Middle Asia</name>. Atmospheric pressure drops during the summer over all warmed <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, particularly over its southerly part. On the charts of mean atmospheric
                pressure readings, the center of the summer Asian depression lies over the western part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name>. Along the southern periphery of the depression, the summer monsoon invades <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, delivering abundant precipitation to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hindustan">Hindustan</name>, the southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas">Himalayas</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indochina">Indochina</name>. To the west, dry and hot air from
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Africa">North Africa</name> moves into the depression area. The aridity of the
                deserttropical climate of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan">Pakistan</name> is related to this movement. <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia">East Asia</name> is under the influence of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> polar front during the summer. In the warm sectors of the cyclones which move
                here, warm and moist tropical sea air (the summer monsoon) moves onto land. The cooling of the sea air over the cold sea currents in the coastal
                regions creates fogs and drizzle. To the south of 38°N lat., where the warm <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kuroshio">Kuroshio Current</name> approaches the shores of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan">Japan</name>, the summer monsoon
                brings incessant rains and high humidity, with high air temperatures. In the autumn, close to the East Asian shores, the frequent tropical
                cyclones (typhoons) are accompanied by hurricane-force winds and downpours which, at their heaviest, often exceed the normal monsoon rainfall
                for the summer. During the winter the Pacific polar front is forced by the strong flow of Siberian air into the tropical latitudes. On the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia_Islands">East Asian islands</name> the effect of the winter continental monsoon is
                mitigated by the bordering seas. The monsoon is warmed while passing over the sea and picks up moisture, which during the winter is returned as
                precipitation on the northwestern slopes of the island chains. In the subequatorial portion of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, continental tropical air prevails during the winter and equatorial sea air during the
                summer. The dry and warm winter winds of the southern Asiatic continental monsoon, which blow toward the equatorial depression, are analogous to
                the trade winds over the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> oceans. The dry spring <pb n="411" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol01.0411"/> is abruptly replaced by the rainy summer
                  (<q>"the monsoon outburst"</q>). The summer monsoon provides enormous amounts of precipitation (up to 2,500 mm a month). Over the equatorial
                parts of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> (the south of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka">Ceylon</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malacca">Malacca
                  Peninsula</name>, as well as the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greater_Sunda_Islands">Greater Sunda Islands</name>),
                eqatorial air prevails, with an even course of high tempertures and abundant rainfall related to the intratropical convergence zone. The <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Sunda_Islands">Lesser Sunda Islands</name> have a monsoon subequatorial climate; wet and
                dry seasons are subordinate to the calendar rhythm ofthe southern hemisphere— wet summer from November through February and a dry winter from
                May through August. (See Table 1)</p>

                within the Asian continent. In the highest area, the uplifts reached 1-4 km and more (for example, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tibet">Tibet</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pamir_Mountains">Pamir</name>), while there were significant subsidences both in the intermontane areas and sags and within the bordering seas (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Japan">Sea of Japan</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea_of_Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsh</name>, and others). Many researchers surmise that the Indian Platform was
                thrust beneath the folded structures of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Himalayas">Himalayas</name> and that the island
                chains were shifted out into the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</name> along the surfaces of abyssal
                shear zones, which contain areas of particularly frequent and strong earthquakes.</p>
                                <p>The Siberian rivers freeze over in the winter (some of them freeze down to the bottom) and flood widely in the spring. In the dry landlocked
                areas of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> only the transit rivers, which are fed by mountain snow and
                glaciers, have abundant water. These rivers reach peak flow rate and highest level in spring or summer (for example, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amu_Darya">Amu Darya</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syr_Darya">Syr
                  Darya</name>). As a rule, other rivers in these regions have little water; the level changes sharply, and they dry up periodically or on
                occasion. The rivers in regions of the monsoon climate have their maximum water discharge in the summer. If not fed by snows in the mountains,
                rivers on the Mediterranean borders become shallow in the summer and sometimes dry up. In the equatorial regions the rivers have a great deal of
                water year-round.</p>

                and saline water in the east.

                                <p>The rivers and lakes of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> are important transport arteries, especially in

                                <p>In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> the entire gamut of soil types is represented, from the waterlogged
                low-humus soils in the arctic wastes to the red-yellow ferroallitic soils in the humid tropical forests of the equatorial latitudes. The change
                in soils from north to south is caused predominantly by temtemperature increase as one moves south and by changes in moisture conditions.</p>
                                <p>Waterlogging caused by poor evaporation and bad drainage under permafrost conditions impedes the leaching of tundra soils and, combined with a
                brief, cold summer and poor aeration, leads to the incomplete disintegration of even the meager organic remains and to the development of
                reduction processes (gleization). The peat gley tundra soils were formed in this manner. The situation changes with an increase in temperature
                and precipitation to the south: intensely leached, acid soils of the podzolic series are formed under nonpermafrost conditions in the forests of
                the temperate latitudes; while taiga-permafrost soils are formed under permafrost conditions, including obstruction of leaching and of the
                interchange of matter under the effect of the freezing and unfreezing processes. Swamps and swamptype soils are widely found in the forested
                zone of the temperate belt.</p>
                                <p>In the southern regions of temperate latitudes (in the central and western portions of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>), the continuing increase of heat is combined with a diminution of moisture. For this
                reason, in these arid regions the leaching of the soils is weakened, and the ascending flows of the soil solution assume greater and greater
                significance. The soils become neutral and rich in bases, while significant quantities of humus accumulate in the surface horizons. In this
                regard, even on the southern edge of the forested zone (beneath the broad-leaved forests) the soils assume a darker tint (the gray forest
                soils), while chernozems form on the forest steppes and steppes with a rich grass stand. Further south, in the even more arid regions, the
                quantity of humus declines, the content of unleached mineral salts increases, and the soils become lighter. Here are the chestnut soils in the
                arid steppes, the light-brown soils in the semideserts, and the gray-brown desert soils in the deserts. In these regions salt bottoms and
                alkalis are widely found. In the humid regions of the temperate latitudes in <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia">East Asia</ref>, beneath the forest vegetation, brown forest soils are formed, while chernozem-like prairie soils, very rich in humus and
                often gleyed, are formed under the grassy, predominantly meadow vegetation.</p>
                                <p>The substantial increase in heat with the transition from the temperate latitudes to the subtropical ones intensifies the chemical weathering.
                With a well-leached water system. this leads to the decomposition and loss of a significant quantity of mineral substances from the soil and to
                the residual accumulation of iron and aluminum sesquioxides (the process of laterization or ferrdallitization). This gives yellow and red tints
                to the soils of the humid regions in the tropical and even lower latitudes. In the humid subtropics red, yellow, and yellow-brown soils
                predominate. Brown soils associated with arid forests and brush predominate in the moderately arid regions, with gray-brown soils in the arid
                regions and gray desert soils in the semideserts. In the tropics the processes of laterization are intensified. Beneath the humid tropical
                forests there is a predominance of red-yellow ferroallitic soils. Red ferroallitic soils are formed under the savannas and dry tropical forests
                of the tropical and subequatorial latitudes; with an increase in aridity these soils turn into the red-brown and desert brown soils. In the arid

                                <p>In the mountains the altitude-zoned series of soil types are represented; as a rule, these are skeletal and underdeveloped. Beneath the

                                <p>
                                    <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> belongs to two phytogeographic regions: the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> region and the <name type="place">Paleotropical</name> region. The <name type="place">Paleotropical</name> flora developed under the conditions of a constantly warm climate and has maintained an exceptional richness
                of species inherited from the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paleozoic">Paleozoic</name> and <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</name> flora. In this area plants exist now which were known in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> only in a fossil form (treelike ferns, cycas, ginkgoes, and others). The <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> flora has been repeatedly impoverished during periods of cooling
                and glaciation and as a result of recent uplifts and the advances of seas. These conditions have made the flora more meager and uniform than the
                  <name type="place">Paleotropical</name> flora, an effect also aided by the present-day severity of natural conditions in the higher
                latitudes.</p>
                                <p>The tundras are without forests. In terms ofthe composition of the flora and the degree of participation of various plant groups, these areas
                are shared between the arctic and typical groups—that is, moss, lichen, and brush tundras (dwarf arctic birch, dwarf willow, bog bilberry,
                cowberry, and so forth). One of the centers for the formation of tundra flora lay in the tundras of northeastern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>, which were not subject to continental glaciation. For this reason, the tundras
                adjacent to the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bering_Strait">Bering Strait</name> are rich in species. The tundras are
                valuable as reindeer pastures (the lichen tundras are the winter pastures, and the grassy and brush tundras are used in the summer).</p>
                                <p>To the south of the tundras stretches a strip of forest tundra in which tundra and thin-forest areas alternate. In northeast <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>, unique variants of forest tundra have developed, with significant areas of stunted
                thickets.</p>
                                <p>Taiga forests predominate in the broad forest area of the temperate zone, including the <name type="place">Ural-Siberian dark</name>,
                coniferous forests in the west (spruce, fir, Siberian stone pine, or cedar), and the Eastern Siberian light coniferous larch and larch-pine
                forests (Siberian and dahurian larch) to the east of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yenisei_River">Enisei River</name>.
                To the south of the taiga stretch mixed broad-leaved coniferous aspen-birch subtaiga and broad- leaved forests. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> the latter have been preserved chiefly in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far_East">Far East</name>, where the climate is less continental and the impoverishing effects of glaciation
                are absent. These forests have a great variety of species and an abun- dance od endemics and relics (the so-called <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchuria_(region)">Manchurian</name> flora). The forest zone possesses colossal reserves of wood and
                industrial raw materials as well as food and medicinal resources. The area of agricultural, land in this zone is small. The flora of the
                northern subzones of the forest zone developed from the flora from the preglacial forests of the temperate zone which retreated to the south
                during the glaciation period. This flora has forrhed as a result of the advancement of the forests to the north behind the retreating and the
                tundra displaced by the glacier. In areas where there was no continental glaciation, forests also occupied the territories which the tundra
                surrendered to them. In the refuges (shelters), which were protected against the influence of glaciation, the representatives of preglacial
                broad-leaved flora <q>"survived"</q> the ice ages. Some of these refuges were the <name type="place">Kolkhida-Lazistan</name> area in western
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Caucasus">Transcaucasia</name> and northeastern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatolia">Anatolia</name>, the <name type="place">Girkan</name> area in the north of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iran">Iran</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lankaran_Lowland">Lenkoran

                of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far_East">Far East</name>.</p>
                                <p>To the south of the forest zone extend the zones of forest steppes (meadow steppes) and typical steppes. The forest steppes are well evidenced
                in southwestern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>, partially in northern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolia">Mongolia</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transbaikal">Transbaikal</name>, and northeastern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Republic_of_China">China</name>. Typical
                steppes (motley grass-sodijy Graminales and drier varieties) are found in the adjacent, more southerly belt. Neither zone extends as far as the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific Ocean</name>. In southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name> and in northwestern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolia">Mongolia</name> these zones are broken by mountain uplifts. Extensive expanses of forest steppes and typical steppes have been plowed up.
                Across the center of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</name>, <name type="place">Middle Asia</name>,
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dzungaria">Dzungaria</name>, the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taklamakan_Desert">Taklamakan</name>, and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mongolian_People's_Republic">Mongolia People's Republic</name> stretch the semideserts and deserts of the

                Iranian uplands, and the southern edge of <name type="place">Middle Asia</name>. Pontic-Central Asian flora (dominated by xerophilic Graminales
                and wormwood communities, with halophilic plants present in salt bottoms and alkalis) are characteristic of the entire complex of extratropical
                desert-steppe zones, where valuable pasture lands are found. Belts of oases and gallery forests Unguis) extend along the rivers here. In the
                littoral portions of the Asiatic Mediterranean area (<name type="place">Asia Minor</name> and the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levant">Levant</name>), xerophilic vegetation of the Mediterranean type is found—shibliak (deciduous
                secondary bush formation), frigana (xerophytic shrub-semishrub formation), and maquis—with a predominance of hard-leaved and smallleaved brush.
                On the semidesert uplands of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwest_Asia">Southwest Asia</ref> the vegetation of the
                mountain steppes is widely represented, as is frigana with subbrush and brush of the thorny cushion type. Typical for the monsoon subtropics are
                the ref East Asian formations of evergreen forests and brush (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Japan">Japan</name>, the south
                of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Korean_Peninsula">Korean peninsula</name>, and southeast <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Republic_of_China">China</name>). Tropical deserts (the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula"</name> and the <name type="place">Tar desert</name>) are found only in
                the western part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>. Predominant in the remaining regions of the tropical
                latitudes are savannas, dry tropical forests, thin forests, and brush; evergreen forests appear mainly on the lee slopes, and there are also
                variably wet evergreen deciduous and mixed forests and wet evergreen tropical forests. In the subequatorial latitudes of the southern hemisphere
                (the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Sunda_Islands">Lesser Sunda Islands</name>), the proximity of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australia">Australia</name> has affected the flora of the savannas and dry tropical forests. with a marked
                admixture of Australian species.</p>
                                <p>In the mountains, flora varies by altitude and degree of exposure of the vegetation cover. Of the mountain types the mountain-tundra and
                mountain-laiga vegetation are most developed, along with the mountain dark coniferous and broad-leaved forests, the mountain steppes and
                deserts, and the mountain subtropical and tropical forests (wet and dry). Subalpine and alpine mountain shrubs and meadows are characteristic
                for the subtropical and temperate zones.</p>

                                <p>The fauna of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is the most pronounced continental fauna in the world. Here
                exists a multiplicity of animal families with very broad distribution, and the diversity of their adaptation to the conditions of existence is
                very great. Many species have extensive ranges (nearly all of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> for the wolf
                and fox). There are few endemic groups of a high taxonomic rank (flying lemurs, tree shrews, tarsiers, gibbons, and giant pandas). There are
                many species in common with the species in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Europe">Europe</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_America">North America</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name>. The ties with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/America">America </name> are the consequence of the recent
                connecting ofthe continents in the zone of <name type="place">Cape Bering</name> and the similarity of contemporary conditions. The result is
                almost complete identicalness of fauna from the American and Asiatic tundras and the significant similarity in the fauna of the forest zone.
                Such species as tapirs and<pb n="414" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol01.0414"/> alligators recall the more ancient ties of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/America">America </name>. The ancient and presently existing overland
                ties with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name> account for significant similarity in the fauna of arid
                southwestern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Africa">North Africa</name>: southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arabian_Peninsula">Arabia</name> is a part of the Ethiopian zoogeographic area, which is common also to <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name>. Proof of the more ancient ties of southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> with <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name> is the
                presence of the elephant, rhinoceros, deer, and peacock in both parts of the world. The <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_Sunda_Islands">Lesser Sunda Islands</name>, with the extreme insular paucity of fauna, have a marked
                admixture of forms belonging to the Australian zoogeographic area. The fauna from other regions, of southern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name>, established as a separate <name type="place">Indo-Malayan</name> area, has preserved an
                ancient appearance inherited from the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neogene">Neocene</name>. The remaining portion of
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Asia">Asia</name> is considered in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palearctic_ecozone">Palaearctic</name> area, the Eurasian part of the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holarctic">Holarctica</name> zoogeographic area. Its fauna has been impoverished by <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quaternary">Quaternary</name> glaciations and recent vertical uplifts.</p>
                                <p>Fauna varies by latitude and altitude. The most impoverished zone is that of the northern oceanic coasts and tundras. Here reptiles and
                amphibians are totally missing. Virtually all the birds are migratory (characteristic are the snowy owl, rock ptarmigan, willow grouse, ducks,
                swans, geese, several species of passerines, eiders, gulls, and black guillemots). The tundra is inhabited by the caribou, arctic fox, and
                common vole and by Cricedidae, while seals, walruses, and polar bears live along the coasts. The small number of different species contrasts
                with the abundance of specimens. This is very characteristic, for example, of the seashore colonies of birds. In the forest zone dwell the elk,
                deer (the caribou, and in the south the maral and the Manchurian red deer), roe deer, musk deer, brown bear, wolverine, lynx, sable, squirrel,
                Siberian chipmunk, blue hare, and forest bank vole, as well as moles, Pteromyidae (flying squirrels), and so forth. Many of them are hunted,
                mainly for fur. Characteristic among the birds are woodpeckers, jays, Siberian jays, nutcrackers, crossbills, and owls. The hazel hens,
                capercaillies, and black grouse are of importance for hunting. There are numerous insects which are harmful to the forests, including various
                carpenter moths, bark beetles, and Bombyx. The penetration of certain steppe fauna into the taiga has been related to the felling of the
                forests. Characteristic of the fauna of the steppes, deserts, and mountain steppes are the ungulates, including antelopes (saiga, the Persian
                gazelle, the goitered gazelle, and others), wild sheep and goats, and such carnivores as the snow leopard, cheetah, striped hyena, jackal,
                corsac, marbled polecat, and steppe polecat. The wild ass, Przhevalski's horse, and wild Bactrian camel have remained in very small numbers. In
                the tugais along the rivers dwell deer (Cervus elaphus) and jungle cats. Rodents are very numerous, including jerboas, susliks, yellow susliks,
                marmots, voles, hares, pikas, and porcupines. The common birds are the larks and desert jays, and the bustard, Egyptian vulture, and lesser
                kestrel, with pheasants in the tugais. The reptiles are extremely numerous and include lizards (agamas, Phrynocephalus, geckoes, monitors, and
                so forth); snakes, including the snake Taphrometopon llneolatum, the Levantine viper, the Eryx (a family of sand boas), Ancistrodon (a genus of
                pit viper), and the cobra; and several species of turtles. Certain insects (the locust and others) are economically harmful. The bites of
                numerous arachnids are dangerous (scorpions, karakurts, tarantulas, and solpugids). The wild yak, the addax, the dongo antelope, the Siberian
                wild dog, the snow leopard, the longtailed marmot (Marmota caudata), and species of mountain goats and sheep have survived in the alpine
                highlands of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref>.</p>
                                <p>The broad-leaved forests of <ref type="place" target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/East_Asia">East Asia</ref> contain the socalled
                Himalayan-Chinese fauna, rich in relic <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neogene">Neocene</name> forms. Here several genera
                of deer (including the Sika deer) have survived along with the goral and takin antelopes, the raccoon dog (which has been widely raised in the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">USSR</name>). yellow-throated marten, black bear, lesser panda, giant panda,
                and tiger, as well as the moles Moger robusta, many rodents, and (in the south) several species of apes. Of the birds the endemic fowl
                (pheasants and others) are of interest. Among the snakes and lizards, the Indo-Malayan species are common. Leatherback turtles are found clear
                up to the basin of the <name type="place">Amur River</name>. The tree toad and the giant salamander are interesting amphibians. The insect world
                is very rich, particularly in butterflies and beetles of the Lyctidae family. In the forests of the equatorial and subequatorial latitudes, the
                Indo-Malayan fauna predominates: the Indian elephant, rhinoceros, and wild ox (the banteng, water buffalo, and others); several species of pigs.
                antelopes, and deer; small deer; tapirs; various species of martens and viverrids (the mongoose and others); bears (black and the sloth bear);
                tigers and leopards (panthers). numerous rodents, bats (including fruit bats), tree shrews pangolins (two species), flying lemurs, and lemurs
                (relics of the ancient connections with <name type="place">Madagascar</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa">Africa</name>); and various species of macaques, gibbons, and, in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indonesia">Indonesia</name>. orangutans. Birds are also abundant (broadbills, pittas. weaverbirds, peacocks, pheasants, hornbills, and man\ others), as
                are reptiles (crocodiles, large-headed turtles, several species of cobras, skinks, geckoes, constrictors, and the flying dragon—an arboreal
                lizard), amphibians (tree frogs and others), and insects (large butterflies, numerous ants, termites, and others). A mixing of faunas occurs on
                the boundaries of the zones. The animal world has been altered by human activity and has been sharply impoverished over broad expanses of
                eastern <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People's_Republic_of_China">China</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India">India</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Java">Java</name>, and southwestern
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siberia">Siberia</name>. The enriching of the fauna which has been carried out in the
                  <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">USSR</name> has made possible an increase in the number of specimens and the
                restoration of the ranges of certain valuable animals (the sable, saiga antelope, elk, and others).</p>

                        <p>, a large populated area whose residents are employed
                        primarily in industry and trade as well as in the spheres of
                        service administration science, and culture. A city is usually
                        the administrative and cultural center of the surrounding
                        region. The main criteria for classifying a populated area as a
                        city are the size of its population and the functions it performs
                        (one or more in various combinations) industrial production, 
                        economic organization, cultural, political, and administrative
                        and the organization of recreation and medical
                        treatment. In a modern city, unlike a village, only a small part
                        of the population is employed in agriculture. Cities are
                        characterized by greater population density and compactness
                        of buildings (frequently multistory buildings). The classification 
                        of a populated area as a city is usually formalized in a
                        definite legal manner and is associated with the establishment
                        of the city limits (the boundaries of the city as an
                        administrative territorial unit) and urban land.</p>
                        <p>In different countries of the world cities are distinguished
                        in censuses and other forms of records in various ways. In
                        some countries a numerical criterion is used (populated areas
                        of a certain size are considered to be cities, the size may be
                        3,000, 5 000, or 10 000 residents in some countries the
                        minimum number of residents for a city is only a few hundred) 
                        In other countries a set of features is used. In the
                        USSR classification of population centers as cities is within
                        the competence of the union republics. The decree of the
                        Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR entitled. On
                        the System for Classifying Population Centers as Cities and
                        Workers' and Resort Settlements of Sept 12 1957 establishes
                        the following categories of cities for the Russian Federation:
                        cities under raion jurisdiction (cultural and industrial
                        centers with a population of at least 12 000, at least 85 percent 
                        of whom are production and clerical workers and members
                        of their families) and cities under krai, oblast, and republic 
                        (ASSR) jurisdiction (large industrial and cultural political
                        centers with populations of more than 50 000) Moscow and
                        Leningrad are placed in a special category.</p>
                        <p>In the early 1970's the population of the cities made up
                        one third of the total population of the world. In Africa less
                        than one fifth of the population lives in cities, in Asia outside
                        the USSR more than one-fifth, in America and Europe out
                        side the USSR up to three fifths, and in the Commonwealth
                        of Australia more than 83 percent. In the USSR in 1970, 56
                        percent of the population lived in cities.</p>
                        <p>There are about 2 000 large cities m the world - that is
                        cities with more than 100,000 residents. More than 100 of
                        them (including suburbs, up to 150) are in the millions (see
                        Table 1) ten of them are in the USSR.</p>
                        <p>In the life of a society, the city (especially the large modern
                        city) is an extraordinarily multifaceted social organism and
                        economic geographic, architectural, engineering, structural,
                        and cultural complex. The city is a historical category that is
                        determined primarily by the socioeconomic structure of the
                        society. Having formed with the transition from the primitive
                        communal order to a class society, the city developed further
                        as the social division of labor grew deeper. Throughout his
                        tory there have been substantial changes in the nature of
                        cities and the place occupied by them in social production,
                        as well as in their public life as a whole, their social
                        composition, and their external appearance. These changes
                        have been reflected primarily in the level of development of
                        productive forces and production relationships achieved by
                        the society.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Economic-geographic and sociological survey</hi> From the
                        point of view of economic geography, cities are above all
                        places in which industrial production and the circulation of
                        significant volumes of goods are concentrated, this determines
                        the development of transportation functions in them.
                        The appearance and development of cities is inseparable
                        from the appearance and deepening of the territorial (geographic) 
                        division of labor. This also determines the production
                        functions of cities in the spheres of industry, transportation, 
                        and exchange, as well as the production of services
                        for the surrounding areas. In addition to the primary group of
                        cities, whose development is based on the function of public
                        production there are also types of cities that are based on administrative
                        functions (although they are usually combined;
                        with trade and production functions) or military functions
                        (fortress cities) cities related to culture and science (university
                        cities, such as Oxford, Heidelberg, Tartu and very recently,
                        the <q>"science cities"</q> such as Dubna), cities related to
                        health and recreation (resort cities such as Sochi and Karlovy
                        Vary), and religious cities (cities that are religious centers -
                        for example, Mecca and Lourdes).</p>
                        <p>The classification of cities on the basis of their
                        functions - and also on the basis of size, which primarily depends
                        on the volume of these functions - should be
                        supplemented by the features of the city's geographic position
                        and the nature of its relations with the territory near it.
                        Thus, among the industrial cities it is possible to distinguish
                        cities that are located close to mineral deposits or energy
                        sources (for example, the cities of the Donbas or Ruhr basin),
                        in transportation centers and densely populated areas, where
                        labor resources are large and particularly cheap, and in areas
                        that have significant resources of agricultural raw material (a
                        special variety is cities that are centers of plantation-type
                        farms) Port cities are distinguished according to the role of
                        export, import, and internal shipping in their functions. In all
                        cases the size and economic saturation of the territory
                        around the city are important for evaluating the economic
                        and geographic conditions of the city's development, for
                        ports it is particularly advantageous to be located at the
                        mouth of a large river with a well developed basin (Leningrad, 
                        New York, Rotterdam and Hamburg), along straits
                        (Istanbul and Copenhagen), or on large capes that extend far
                        out into a body of water (Dakar and Cape Town). Because
                        the economic and geographic factors that determine the type
                        of the city through its functions are historically variable, the
                        cities themselves may change their profile historically. The
                        natural environment in which cities develop is also
                        fundamental - for example, location near mountain passes
                        (many cities in northern Italy), on navigable rivers (the Volga
                        cities), on a convenient bay (Vladivostok), or on the border
                        between natural zones.</p>
                        <p>During their historical development some cities lost their
                        significance or even disappeared entirely (as in the case of the
                        "dead cities"), others have become more significant by acquiring
                        an increasingly broad sphere of influence. The size of
                        this sphere also depends on the development of the system of
                        transportation, the progress of transportation promotes the
                        development of larger cities, leaving smaller cities only the
                        role of local centers.</p>
                        <p>Historical development as a whole is leading to increasing
                        urbanization of the population and to the consolidation of
                        cities. The degree of urbanization in a country is an important
                        index of the level of its economic development. Extensive
                        distribution of group forms of urban population is typical of
                        current urbanization - for example in the USSR more than
                        three fourths of the urban population is concentrated in local
                        groups of cities. Frequently there are satellite cities in the
                        vicinity of modern large cities. Cities often grow by forming
                        agglomerations or conurbations the best known examples
                        are the so called megalopolis - the enormous, solidly urbanized
                        zone from Boston to Washington in the United
                        States - and the official conurbations in Great Britain. In the
                        socialist countries the group forms of urban settlement are
                        organized by means of regional plans.</p>
                        <p>The production relations that determine the social order of
                        the given society manifest themselves in concentrated form
                        in these cities (<hi rend="italic">see below</hi> Historical survey of the development 
                        of the city).</p>
                        <p>The city is a definite type of social organization (community),
                        distinct from the village, whose residents have inherent
                        traits that are united in the concept of the urban way of life.
                        The city is characterized by the concentration and intensity
                        of different forms of social interaction and by a specific (in</p>

                        organizational structure. The large modern city is distinguished 
                        by a high degree of variety in types of occupations,
                        by a concentration of a skilled work force, by a higher per
                        centage of employment in the spheres of science, culture,
                        and administration (this is particularly increasing under conditions 
                        of the current scientific technical revolution), and by
                        a well-developed system of state and public organizations.
                        Unlike the relative stability of the medieval city, the social
                        organization of the current city is distinguished by a highly
                        dynamic structure a multitude and variety of external and
                        internal relations, and the absence of closed social "cells"
                        (commune and guild). The urban way of life is distinguished
                        by greater variety in modes of life, needs, tastes, and habits.
                        Traditions and customs play a significantly smaller part in the
                        city than in the village. Cities, especially large ones, which
                        draw in population from vast areas, are becoming centers
                        where various ethnic groups are mixed and assimilated, at
                        the same time in capitalist and other cities of the presocialist
                        age, the ugly phenomena of ethnic segregation occur (for
                        example, the Negro ghettos in the USA).</p>

                        municipal transportation units, and so on) necessary for
                        normal operation of housing resources and for relations
                        among residential areas, industrial enterprises, the terminal

                        The level of amenities and services in the city is very important
                        for establishing healthy, convenient, and civilized living
                        conditions for the population, this includes the development
                        of municipal transportation and the establishment of a network
                        of municipal and domestic institutions, city lighting,
                        green areas, and sanitation. The system of sanitary and
                        public health measures in the modern city is directed toward
                        the elimination of the negative consequences for human
                        health of life in large cities - overpopulation, shortage of
                        clean air and light, isolation from nature, and increased pollution,
                        noise, and nervous strain, which are linked with the
                        significant incidence in cities of certain diseases, such as cardiovascular
                        diseases, lung cancer, nervous disorders, and

                        cities that were rebuilt or in the new cities of the socialist
                        countries). In new cities this zoning is usually done rather
                        precisely, in the structure of cities that have taken shape
                        historically, the industrial regions are often interspersed with
                        residential areas (the so called strip arrangement of functional
                        zones takes shape). Functional centers that consolidate
                        the labor domestic life and recreation of the urban
                        dwellers sometimes form in modern cities. The center of the
                        city, where the most important administrative and cultural
                        institutions and memorial complexes are usually located, performs
                        public, ideological, and representative functions.
                        Therefore, the most important architectural groupings, which
                        determine the compositional structure of the entire city are
                        located in the center. The business and administrative buildings
                        (banks stock exchanges, offices, and so on) which are

                        streets with their loud, brightly colored advertising (Broad
                        way in New York), are located in the center of capitalist
                        cities.</p>
                        <p>The appearance of the historical center of cities and areas
                        populated by the capitalist class differs sharply from that of
                        the proletarian areas in the level of services and amenities
                        and the type of residences. The social regionalization of the
                        capitalist cities may vary (for example, an intensive process
                        of resettlement by the privileged strata of the population from
                        the central regions of large cities, which are unhealthy because
                        of air pollution and noise, to the green, well-organized
                        suburbs is under way) In the centers of cities in the socialist
                        countries, public buildings and cultural institutions play a
                        large part. In socialist cities there is no juxtaposition of the
                        center to the periphery, but rather a very close unity is observed
                        in the structure of the city. This is achieved by developing
                        a system for the social center (the capital avenues of
                        Moscow), which is the core of the entire urban structure, and
                        by a high level of public service and amenities in the new
                        residential regions, where the level of comfort is frequently
                        higher than in the central areas (for example, the Southwest
                        and Khirnki-Khovrino in Moscow, the housing development
                        along Maurice Thorez Street in Leningrad, and the Žirmūnai
                        area in Vilnius). Industry has a large influence on the external
                        appearance of cities through the considerable area it occupies
                        its enormous buildings and structures, and its open
                        installations and plant smokestacks (for example, the motor
                        vehicle plant and the Krasnoe Sormovo plant in Gorky and
                        the Fiat plants in Turin)</p>
                        <p>Under the influence of the scientific-technical revolution,
                        research establishments are occupying an increasingly large
                        place in cities, frequently forming special urban centers.
                        Transportation, which ensures the functioning of the city as a
                        whole and of its individual zones determines the external
                        appearance of the modern city to a large extent through
                        streams of motor vehicles, parking areas, transportation
                        structures, high-speed roads, interchanges (for example, in
                        Los Angeles), and motor-vehicle and railroad terminals.
                        Green areas also play an important part in the external appearance
                        of a city, this is seen in parks, squares, and
                        boulevards (the A M Gorky Central Park for Culture and
                        Recreation, the Moscow Sokol niki Park for Culture and
                        Recreation, and the Izmailovo Park for Culture and Recreation
                        in Moscow, Hyde Park in London, and the Tuilenes and
                        the Bois de Boulogne in Paris)</p>
                        <p>The external appearance of old cities is complex and multifaceted, 
                        their long historical development (sometimes many
                        centuries) takes physical form in their historical and architectural
                        heritage. The appearance of such cities results from
                        the complex interaction of elements that took shape at different
                        times and gave the cities individual, sometimes inimitable, features. 
                        In small historical cities such as Bukhara and
                        Pskov, and especially in preserved cities such as Suzdal', the
                        historical and architectural heritage is an important factor in
                        shaping their external appearance. In large, rapidly developing
                        historical cities, this heritage becomes just a fragment of
                        the current city, preserving its significance in the composition
                        of the areas of the historical center (Moscow, Yaroslavl,
                        and Prague). Many old European cities preserve their historical
                        nucleus, which sometimes includes structures from the
                        classical era (acropolises, forums theaters, and other structures 
                        in Mediterranean cities) but more often they have a
                        medieval center with a castle (citadel) a market square, the
                        radial-ring plan typical of many cities in the medieval period,
                        and narrow crooked streets. Next to the medieval nucleus
                        are blocks from the 18th and first half of the 19th century,
                        usually with a regular plan, and the formal building groups of
                        a new center, the rings of boulevards occupy the places
                        where the demolished city fortifications were. Urban aristo
                        crats' mansions and homes from the 17th century to the first
                        quarter of the 19th century stand next to brick factory buildings
                        from the second half of the 19th century, business
                        buildings (banks, stock exchanges, and offices), railroad
                        stations, and multiapartment income properties. Modern
                        urban buildings, whose stark forms contrast sharply with the
                        architecture of the past, are directly beside what were once
                        suburban palaces and mansions. The spires and domes of
                        churches, large public buildings, high-rise residential buildings,
                        television towers, and factory smokestacks form the
                        complex skyline of the modern city. The external appearance
                        of the city changes during the process of its development,
                        new buildings and structures that reflect the needs, current
                        aesthetic ideals, and technical capacities of the society frequently
                        appear in the historical nucleus or in its immediate
                        vicinity. All the problems related to planning and building
                        cities are included in urban planning.</p>

                        <p>In cities of the USSR the population elects city soviets of
                        working people's deputies (in the large cities there are also
                        raion Soviets) for a term of two years, with extensive authority.
                        Each soviet elects an executive committee (ispolkorn) as
                        its executive body, which carries on everyday administration
                        of the city or raion, with extensive public participation
                        through the formation of ispolkorn commissions for various
                        sectors of administration.</p>
                        <p>In foreign socialist countries the cities have elected governmental
                        bodies people's councils (in Bulgaria, Poland,
                        Rumania, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), city
                        assemblies of deputies (the German Democratic Republic),
                        national committees (Czechoslovakia), city councils (Hungary), 
                        people's assemblies (the Korean People's Democratic
                        Republic), <hi rend="italic">khurals</hi> of working people's deputies (in the Mongolian
                        People's Republic), and communal <hi rend="italic">skupštine</hi> (in
                        Yugoslavia). In all of these countries the city governmental
                        bodies are elected by the inhabitants for four years (except in
                        the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Mongolia, where
                        the term is two years). The city governmental bodies form
                        executive bodies (executive committees, councils, or administrations),
                        usually from among their own deputies, and
                        they also establish administrations, divisions, or commissions
                        for various sectors of the national economy and culture.</p>
                        <p>The main forms of city administration in the capitalist
                        states took shape in the 19th century as a result of municipal
                        reforms. The needs of the capitalist economy and pressure
                        from the popular masses led to a certain expansion of the
                        functions of city authorities, especially on questions of
                        municipal services, education, health, and road-building,
                        under the pressure of the working people universal suffrage
                        was extended to elections for municipal bodies. The city administrative
                        bodies typical of present capitalist states are the
                        elected municipal council, a head of the city administration
                        (mayor burgomaster, manager, and so on) elected by the<pb n="26" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0026"/>
                        council or by the population, and the divisions departments,
                        and other services subordinate to them. In France and many
                        other Western European countries the head of the city administration
                        also acts as representative of the central authority. 
                        In Great Britain mayors are given insignificant authority,
                        and the management of different sectors of city administration
                        is assigned to permanent commissions of the municipal
                        councils. In the USA control of the municipal apparatus is
                        concentrated in the hands of the mayor or a professional
                        manager appointed by the council. Special forms of administration
                        are frequently established for capital cities.</p>
                        <p>In the second half of the 20th century the development of
                        centralist tendencies in state life led to substantial changes in
                        the nature of capitalist urban administration, it is increasingly
                        becoming a tool of state capitalist control. The administrative
                        dependence of urban authorities on the central government
                        and the entire administrative apparatus of the central authority
                        is growing broader. The inadequacy of capital income in
                        municipal budgets (primarily through tax payments by the
                        population) makes the municipality strongly financially dependent 
                        on state subsidies. The encroachment of the imperialist 
                        state on the traditional rights of municipalities is
                        growing stronger, the role of elected city councils is decreasing
                        and their functions are more and more often turned over
                        to municipal civil servants. Some of the powers of urban
                        agencies are passing to the competence of higher-ranking
                        governmental agencies, and various regional administrative
                        institutions that actually replace municipalities are being established.</p>
                        <p>Despite the encroachment on the rights and authority of
                        municipal bodies in the current capitalist state, the Communist
                        and workers' parties attach great importance to participation
                        by Communists in these bodies and try to use this
                        institution in the interests of the popular masses, because the
                        questions with which municipalities are concerned are directly
                        linked to the interests of the working population, and it
                        is easier to join all democratic forces around municipal
                        bodies. The municipal program of the Communist parties in
                        the Western European countries meets the needs of the
                        broad masses, evidence of this is seen in Communist victories
                        in the municipal elections in many cities and regions of
                        France, Italy, and certain other countries.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Historical survey of the development of the city</hi> Cities arise in
                        the historical stage in which the processes of social division
                        of labor and social differentiation originate in society and, in
                        connection with this, different social groupings (different
                        strata of the developing exploiting classes, including representatives
                        of incipient state power, artisans, and merchants)
                        separate from the main mass of the population, which
                        is engaged in homogeneous agricultural labor. The formation
                        of these groupings and their concentration in certain populated
                        points leads to the formation of urban type commumties
                        (certain historians call this important historical
                        event the urban revolution). As archaeological excavations
                        show relatively large-scale settlements with compactly arranged
                        residential buildings made of clay and adobe brick
                        (Ҫatal-Hoyuk in Asia Minor, Jericho in Palestine, and Annau
                        and Namazga-Tepe in Middle Asia) formed as early as the
                        seventh to fourth millennia B C , later, some of these settlements
                        developed into cities. The appearance of the first cities
                        dates to the fourth to third millennia B C. At first, when cities
                        were forming on the basis of still comparatively weakly developed
                        technology and the economics of the early class
                        societies of the Aeneolithic and Bronze ages, the main constituent
                        element of their population in most cases was probably
                        the representatives of the ruling classes and state power,
                        who lived by exploiting the dependent agricultural population.
                        The cities that were formerly large administrative
                        political and religious centers usually reached the greatest
                        sizes. In connection with the subsequent development of
                        crafts and exchange, the artisan and merchant population
                        began to play an ever-increasing role in the cities. In the
                        initial period of the history of the ancient world (fourth to
                        second millennia B C ) the most important urban centers
                        formed in the river civilizations which were most developed
                        at that time, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, in the
                        Nile valley and, somewhat later, in the Indus valley. In these
                        areas, thanks to specific characteristics of their economies,
                        which were based on irrigation farming, particularly favorable
                        conditions existed for the early development of class society 
                        and cities (the Sumenan cities of Ur Lagash and Nippur,
                        and later Akkad and Ashur, Babylon in Mesopotamia,
                        Memphis and Thebes in Egypt, and Mohenjo-Daro and
                        Harappa in the Indus basin).</p>
                        <p>A large step forward in the development of cities was taken
                        in the first millennium B C when there was a significant expansion
                        in the area of distribution of class societies and important
                        socioeconomic and political changes took place in
                        them (in this stage of development iron began to be used
                        extensively, therefore cities of this age are sometimes called
                        Iron Age cities). At this time cities formed in China that were
                        large by the scale of the ancient world (cities had appeared in
                        the Hwang Ho basin as early as the second millennium) - for
                        example, the capital centers of Loyang and Changan (near
                        the present day Sian). In India the cities of the Indus valley
                        went into a decline in the second millennium, and in their
                        place new cities grew up, primarily in the Ganges basin (the
                        most important was Patahputra [Patna]) New cities formed
                        and old ones developed in Southwest Asia (Babylon, which
                        probably became the largest city in the middle of the first
                        millennium, Nineveh in Assyria, Persepolis in the
                        Achaemenid state, Jerusalem, and the cities of Phoenicia,
                        Tyre and Sidon [Saida], which carried on extensive trade on
                        the Mediterranean Sea and founded colonies along its coast,
                        including Carthage in North Africa).</p>
                        <p>Classical cities that were the focus of all the social life of
                        the city-states (poleis) typical of classical society took shape
                        in the middle of the first millennium B C. Popular assemblies
                        gathered in the city squares (the Greek agora and the Roman
                        forum), there were temples, various public buildings (stadiums,
                        theaters, baths, and markets), port structures and
                        homes of merchants and artisans in the cities.</p>
                        <p>The classical cities formed earliest in Greece (the largest
                        trade and artisan cities of European Greece were Athens and
                        Corinth, and of the coast of Asia Minor, Miletus and
                        Ephesus). During the age of Greek colonization they spread
                        to many areas of the Mediterranean and Black seas, and as a
                        result of the conquests of Alexander the Great they spread to
                        the territory of the Hellenistic states, where large urban centers
                        existed (Alexandria, Seleucia, Antioch, Pergamum, and
                        others). Classical cities also formed in Italy and spread to
                        other countries as a result of Roman conquests. Cities that
                        were part of the Roman state had varying legal status (in the
                        first century B C the status of city municipium was established
                        for Italy and later spread to the cities of the Roman
                        provinces) but they kept the social structure and forms of
                        self-government with elected magistrates that were typical of
                        them.</p>
                        <p>The development and spread of the classical cities was
                        accompanied by their growth and an increase in importance
                        for trade and crafts, but in a majority of cases landowners
                        remained the predominant element in sociopolitical life.
                        Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire, became the largest
                        city of the state. During the period of decline of the Roman
                        empire (third to fifth centuries) the populations of the cities
                        decreased, and they became more agrarian.</p>
                        <p>The formation of cities exerted a strong influence on social
                        development. Cities became the organizational centers of
                        state power and of the development of culture, particularly
                        construction and architecture. Their formation promoted the
                        development of crafts and trade, and merchant and loan capital
                        collected in them. The classical cities played a particularly
                        large historical role, the entire ancient civilization, with its
                        great achievements, was clearly urban in nature.</p>
                        <p>The early Middle Ages (sixth to tenth centuries) were
                        characterized by the decline of the cities in Western Europe.<pb n="27" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0027"/>
                        Under conditions of the predominance of subsistence farming 
                        the Roman cities either disappeared entirely or lost their
                        former economic significance and municipal organization.
                        The urban type population centers that existed at that time
                        were distinguished from the countryside primarily by their
                        fortifications and by the fact that they were administrative
                        centers (the residences of bishops, counts, and so on). A
                        qualitative leap forward in the development of Western
                        European cities occurred in the 11th and 12th centuries with
                        the advent of the period of developed feudalism. With the
                        intensive process of separating crafts from agriculture, the
                        craftsman and merchant population separated from the mass
                        of the rural population and concentrated at certain points. At
                        first the centers to which this population was drawn were the
                        feudal residences or the old Roman cities. The rapid growth
                        of cities began earliest (in the tenth century) in Italy and later
                        in the Netherlands, France and the Rhine and southern parts
                        of Germany. A comparatively small part of the population
                        was still concentrated in cities, and small, semiagrarian urban
                        settlements predominated. The cities that reached the largest
                        sizes were large centers of intermediate trade and handicraft
                        production and important administrative political and religious
                        centers (Venice, Genoa, Florence, Milan, Rome,
                        Naples, Paris, London, Bruges, Ghent, Cologne, and
                        Lubeck).</p>
                        <p>At first the cities, like the countryside, were entirely dependent
                        on the feudal lords. The major secular or religious
                        lord in whose possessions the city was located (the lord of the
                        city) concentrated in his hands the power over the city population
                        and collected from them various kinds of payments in
                        money and also partially in kind. However as the result of a
                        long struggle that assumed various forms (from armed uprisings
                        to buying individual freedoms from the feudal lords), the
                        merchant and artisan population of the cities of medieval
                        Western Europe freed themselves from this dependence and
                        achieved rights and privileges (which differed in different
                        countries and cities) not enjoyed by the rural population. The
                        primary privileges were the personal freedom of all members
                        of the urban commune (that is, citizens of the city), city
                        courts (which were guided by special legal norms that were
                        more appropriate to the conditions of urban life), elected
                        governmental bodies, the most important of which was the
                        city council in self governing cities (it introduced city taxes
                        itself and determined the method of their Collection, managed
                        administrative affairs, supervised commerce and crafts, and
                        commanded the city's military forces), the abolition of various
                        feudal obligations and their replacement (where dependence
                        on the lord of the city or the king was preserved) by
                        definite monetary payments, and the recognition that the
                        commune had the rights of a military corporation. Under the
                        conditions of feudal society, with its hierarchical structure,
                        these freedoms and privileges changed certain cities (of the
                        type of the French and Italian communes or the German
                        imperial cities) into something like collective lords, who frequently
                        acquired feudal rights over the neighboring peasant
                        population, sometimes the cities (especially in Italy and
                        Germany, which were broken up into numerous small feudal
                        units) actually became independent city-states.</p>
                        <p>In the period immediately following the acquisition of the
                        rights of self-government, power in the city was usually taken
                        by the patriciate. In the industrially developed cities the artisans 
                        who had joined in guilds were able to gain participation
                        in city government and sometimes to completely push out the
                        patrician aristocracy (Florence and Cologne) However, it
                        was usually the upper circles of the guild masters (the guild
                        oligarchy) who came to power in the cities, and the broad
                        democratic strata of the urban artisan population and the
                        urban plebeians stood opposed to them.</p>
                        <p>The medieval cities, the focus of commodity production,
                        exerted a profound influence on all aspects of the life of
                        feudal society. During the period of small, fragmented feudal
                        holdings, the cities - which were interested in securing more
                        favorable conditions for the development of crafts and
                        commerce - acted as allies of royal power in the struggle
                        against the separatism of the large scale feudal lords in most
                        of the Western European countries, thus promoting the establishment
                        of centralized states. The admission of city
                        dwellers to the estate representation bodies of the feudal
                        state was an indicator of the increasing role of cities in the
                        life of medieval society.</p>
                        <p>During the Middle Ages technical progress was linked first
                        of all with the urban crafts, new, more highly developed
                        forms of commerce and monetary circulation took shape in
                        the cities, more efficient methods of administration and taxation
                        were developed in the sphere of city government, there
                        were fundamental changes in the field of culture, and at the
                        end of the 15th century and during the 16th century (in Italy,
                        beginning in the 14th century) the urban culture of the Renaissance
                        developed. In the 16th and 17th centuries urban
                        industry and commerce began to grow out of the framework
                        of the economic forms that had taken shape in cities during
                        the Middle Ages and the framework of the medieval city
                        structure, with its guild limitations and oligarchic administration.
                        The most significant cities, whose economies were
                        based to a large extent on the new, capitalist organization of
                        production and commerce, developed at this time in the
                        Netherlands (Antwerp until the end of the 16th century, then
                        Amsterdam), England, and France.</p>
                        <p>In the countries of Asia and northern Africa, the transition
                        to the Middle Ages was not associated with such a decline in
                        urban life as in the countries of Western Europe. In these
                        regions populous cities, many of which had appeared in ancient
                        times, continued to exist during the early Middle Ages.
                        The largest of the medieval Eastern cities were Damascus,
                        Baghdad, and Cairo in the Arabian Caliphate, Isfahan and
                        Shiraz in Iran, Delhi in India, and the Chinese cities of Changan,
                        Loyang, Kuangchou (Canton), and Peking Large cities
                        also existed at this time in Middle Asia. The eastern cities,
                        which significantly surpassed the Western European cities in
                        population and wealth, for a long time (at least until the 12th
                        and 13th centuries) did not have the rights and privileges that
                        had been won by the European cities. Their merchant and
                        artisan population was not organized in self governing communes,
                        did not have special urban freedoms, and was entirely
                        subordinate to the feudal authorities represented by the
                        feudal state (only a few cities in medieval Japan achieved
                        partial rights of self-government) Historical science has not
                        yet completely clarified the reasons for this difference in the
                        administrative and legal status of these cities. Among these
                        reasons were the concentration in the eastern cities of feudal
                        lords who, as a result of their wealth and dominant position in
                        society, became a very influential element in life within the
                        city, the significant development of the production of handicraft
                        articles in shops belonging to individual feudal lords and
                        to the state, which undermined the economic position of the
                        urban artisans; and the centralization of state power, which
                        facilitated the establishment of control over the urban population.
                        The complete domination by feudal lords and the
                        feudal state in the cities of the non-European countries retarded
                        the independent development of urban crafts and
                        commodity production and delayed the birth of elements of
                        capitalist relations.</p>
                        <p>With the development of capitalism, cities began to occupy
                        a new place in public production and in public life as a whole
                        The most important means of production typical of
                        capitalism and the primary classes of capitalist society - the
                        bourgeoisie and the industrial proletariat - were concentrated
                        in these cities.</p>
                        <p>The vigorous growth of cities and the urban population,
                        which was a result of further intensification of the social division
                        of labor under capitalism and was related to the general
                        progressive process of concentration of production and the
                        appearance of capitalist industry and new types of transportation
                        (the railroads), began with the Industrial Revolution
                        and became an inalienable part of industrialization. In the
                        mid-19th century, Great Britain's urban population was 50<pb n="28" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0028"/>
                        percent of the population of the country, and at the beginning
                        of the 20th century it was 78 percent In Germany in the early
                        1880's the urban population was 41 percent and at the beginning
                        of the 20th century it was 54.3 percent. In the USA,
                        where the urban population at the beginning of the 19th century
                        did not exceed 4 percent, in the early 1880's it was 28.6
                        percent, at the beginning of the 20th century it was 40 percent,
                        in the early 1920's it was more than 50 percent, and in
                        the 1960's it was more than 70 percent (In view of differences
                        in criteria for classifying cities these figures are relative).
                        With the development of industry and means of transportation, 
                        large and very laige cities grew especially quickly
                        (see Table 2) As a result, the large industrial cities had an
                        ever increasing share of the urban population.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The population growth of the capitalist cities occurred
                        primarily through migration to these cities from outside
                        (mainly the destitute rural population), immigration from
                        Europe was a significant source of growth in overseas
                        American and Australian cities. The large capitalist city became
                        the center of polarization of the class forces of
                        capitalism, and it was there that the contradictions inherent
                        in the capitalist order - between labor and capital and between
                        luxury and poverty - manifested themselves most
                        acutely. The growth of the capitalist city and the appearance
                        of giant cities was followed by the appearance of a number of
                        specifically large-city problems, such as the housing question
                        the problem of transportation, and the increased incidence
                        of disease in cities. All of these problems were
                        reflected above all and with particular seventy in the poor
                        strata of the urban population. The social problems of the
                        capitalist city were engendered by a whole set of factors
                        above all by the antagonistic nature of capitalist production
                        the predatory nature of capitalist entrepreneurship, and private
                        ownership of city land and buildings (which results in
                        high prices for land within the city boundaries, high apartment
                        rents, and difficulties in solving the problems of replanning
                        capitalist cities because of the enormous expenditures
                        involved in buying land and buildings from their owners)
                        The opposition between the city and the country, which has
                        accompanied the entire history of the existence of exploiting
                        society, reached special acuteness under capitalism.</p>
                        <p>In most countries of Asia and Africa the process of urbanization
                        manifested itself in a specific colonial form (cities
                        there frequently developed from strongholds, the bulwarks of
                        colonial rule or developed as ports or other centers of colonial
                        commerce). The slowness of capitalist development and
                        the economic backwardness of the colonial and dependent
                        countries led to a situation in which the level of urbanization
                        in these countries lagged far behind the level of the countries
                        of Europe and North America. Even by the mid-20th century
                        in the countries of Asia outside the USSR, little more than 20
                        percent of the population lived in cities. The percentage of
                        urban population in Africa, especially in the tropics, was
                        even lower. In the mid 20th century the process of growth in
                        cities and urban population became very swift in the developing
                        countries. In many of these countries industrialization
                        lags behind urbanization, this is the source of a number of
                        complex problems in the development of cities, such as unemployment
                        among the urban population and the growth of
                        poverty.</p>
                        <p>Beginning with the age of capitalism the cities have
                        been - and remain - the main bulwarks of the revolutionary
                        movement. The Great French Revolution relied above all on
                        Paris, and the most important events of the revolutions of
                        1848-49 were associated with Vienna, Berlin Paris, and so
                        on. As the working class grows the cities become centers for
                        its action, beginning with strikes and ending with armed uprisings.</p>
                        <p>The cities in which the industrial proletariat is concentrated
                        are the main bulwarks of the socialist revolutions. The
                        new social order inherits from capitalism the old patterns of
                        settlement. Among the socialist countries are countries with
                        different initial levels of industrial development and different
                        degrees of urbanization from countries such as the German
                        Democratic Republic (GDR) and Czechoslovakia, in which
                        the percentage of urban population was significant (about 72
                        percent in the GDR in 1950 and about 49 percent in Czechoslovakia
                        in 1947), to countries with a very low percentage of
                        urban population (about 20 percent in Albania in 1950, about
                        10 percent in China in 1949, and about 6 percent in the
                        Democratic Republic of Vietnam as late as 1957). The process
                        of socialist industrialization is accompanied by rapid
                        growth in the number of cities and in urban population. In the
                        USSR, for example, the urban population was 18 percent by
                        1917, and according to the 1970 census it had reached 56
                        percent (See also below Table 3, Growth of cities and urban
                        population in the USSR). Among the European socialist
                        countries, the growth of the urban population of Poland (31.8
                        percent in 1946 and 52.2 percent in 1970), Bulgaria (24.5 percent
                        and about 52.2 percent respectively), and Rumania
                        (23.4 percent in 1948 and 41 percent in 1970) is particularly
                        rapid. Growth in urban population occurs both through an
                        increase in the number of residents of old cities and through
                        the appearance of new cities. Their growth is linked with the
                        policy followed by the socialist states of even distribution of
                        industry, culture, and science throughout the country. In the
                        European socialist countries about two fifths of the total
                        urban population in the mid 1960's lived in cities with a population
                        of more than 100 000.</p>
                        <p>Socialist cities develop on the basis of public ownership of
                        the means of production under conditions of a planned
                        socialist economy, which creates the prerequisites for solving
                        the major problems of city development - settlement and
                        planned control of city growth, reconstruction of old cities,
                        solution of the housing problem and so on. Under socialists
                        the socioeconomic base and class composition of city population
                        changes fundamentally, the division between special residential
                        areas populated by the well to do and the areas of
                        the working poor which is characteristic of capitalist cities
                        disappears.</p>
                        <p>The socialist revolution begins the process of overcoming
                        the contradiction between the city and the countryside. The
                        city has the leading role in socialist transformation of the
                        countryside, and the countryside receives skilled workers
                        equipment, chemical fertilizer, and consumer goods from the
                        city. The city takes socialist culture to the countryside.</p>
                        <p>HISTORICAL SURVEY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITIES ON
                        THE TERRITORY OF THE USSR The most ancient cities on the
                        territory of the USSR appeared during the first millennium
                        BC in the states of Transcaucasia (Erebuni Teishebairu, and
                        others) and Middle Asia (Samarkand [Marakanda], Merv,
                        and others) Between the sixth century B C and the fourth
                        century A D there were classical cities, which took shape as
                        Greek colonies, on the coast of the Black Sea.</p>
                        <p>Among the eastern Slavs cities first formed as fortified
                        settlements (the Russian word for "city." <hi rend="italic">gorod</hi> signified a
                        walled place) With the formation of early feudal class society
                        the cities began to change into centers of princely power
                        and trade and commerce. At the end of the tenth century
                        there were about 25 cities in Ancient Rus', including Kiev,
                        Chernigov, Smolensk, Novgorod, and Pskov. In the 11th
                        century, 64 new cities are mentioned, in the 12th century
                        134, and in the 13th century (until 1237), 47 Crafts, com-<pb n="29" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0029"/>
                        merce, and culture developed in the cities of Ancient Rus'.
                        The cities were the site of major antifeudal uprisings (1068-69
                        and 1113 in Kiev, 1136 and 1207 in Novgorod and 1174 in
                        Vladimir). In the llth to 13th centuries popular assemblies
                        (the <hi rend="italic">veche</hi>) took on an important role. The rise of the class
                        struggle in Novgorod in the mid-12th century led to the formation
                        of the Novgorod Feudal Republic.</p>
                        <p>During the Mongol invasion (1236-40), the majority of
                        Russian cities were destroyed. Cities formed again in northeastern
                        Russia in the second half of the 14th century, the
                        cities that stood on important land and water routes grew
                        particularly rapidly (Moscow Tver', Nizhny Novgorod,
                        Kolomna and Kostroma). New cities arose, primarily in the
                        Moscow Principality. the most heavily populated area. However,
                        the Mongol yoke seriously retarded socioeconomic development
                        of the cities. With the rise and strengthening of
                        Moscow, city dwellers supported the struggle of the Muscovite
                        princes for the unity of the country.</p>
                        <p>With the formation of the centralized Russian state, more
                        favorable conditions were established for the development of
                        cities. In the mid-16th century there were 160 cities, many of
                        which were built on the southern and southeastern borders of
                        the country as fortified military settlements Vasri sursk,
                        Orel Tsaritsyn and others. In the 14th to 16th centuries
                        cities such as Sol'-Kamskaia (in the Perm' region) and Sol'-
                        Vychegodskaia (in the Arkhangel sk region) formed and developed
                        as centers of the mining industry. With the establishment
                        of centralized state control the power of the feudal
                        state over the cities grew stronger. In 1649 the privately
                        owned <q>'white settlements'</q> in the cities were eliminated, and
                        all city dwellers came under the rule of the state.</p>
                        <p>The population of the cities took an active part in the
                        struggle against foreign intervention in the early 17th century
                        (the heroic defense of Smolensk in 1609-11, the uprising in
                        Moscow in 1611 and the struggle of the residents of Novgorod,
                        Pskov, Korely [present day Priozersk, Leningrad Oblast],
                        and Yaroslavl against the Polish-Lithuanian and
                        Swedish interventionists). The initiative for forming a national
                        militia to fight the interventionists arose among the
                        Nizhny Novgorod <hi rend="italic">posadskie hudi</hi> (merchants and artisans).</p>
                        <p>A new stage in the development of Russian cities came in
                        the 17th century, with the beginning of a massive change
                        from crafts to small-scale commodity production. At that
                        time there were 226 cities in Russia (excluding the Ukraine
                        and Siberia), but the level of development of urban life in the
                        country as a whole was low because of intensified serfdom.
                        The reforms of the first quarter of the 18th century had great
                        influence on the development of the cities. The First Provincial
                        Reform, according to which certain large cities became
                        provincial centers, was carried out in 1708. According to the
                        Statutes on Provinces of 1775 many cities that were part of
                        provinces became district centers. The number of cities in
                        the country reached 336. Certain cities became centers of
                        the textile industry and cities formed around metallurgical
                        and other enterprises (Ekaterinburg, Nizhni Tagil, Petrozavodsk,
                        and Lipetsk). In the 1720's there were <hi rend="italic">pesad</hi>
                        (merchant and artisan) populations in about 200 cities, they
                        constituted about 183,000 males, or 3.2 percent of the country's
                        population. <hi rend="italic">Ratusht</hi> (bodies for city self-government)
                        were instituted in 1699, followed in 1720 by the Main Magistrate
                        and later by city magistrates.</p>
                        <p>By the end of the 18th century the urban population had
                        grown to 1.3 million persons, or 4.1 percent of the population
                        of the country. Many state and palace settlements and towns
                        had taken on a merchant artisan character, and in the 1770's
                        and 1780's the government reclassified them as cities
                        (for example, Bogorodsk, Podol'sk, Bronnitsy, Vrazniki,
                        Gzhatsk, and Rybinsk) In the south, new cities - such as
                        Kherson, Odessa, Nikolaev, and Taganrog - formed and became
                        port centers.</p>
                        <p>After the abolition of serfdom in 1861 the development of
                        cities in Russia accelerated. Certain cities were transformed
                        into large industrial centers. Trying to satisfy the interests of
                        the growing Russian capitalist class, the government carried
                        out the urban reform of 1870. However, the functions of city
                        government were extremely limited. In 1863 city dwellers
                        constituted 10 percent of the total population of Russia, in
                        1897 (according to the census), 12.9 percent. By 1917 there
                        were about 800 cities in the Russian Empire, and 18 percent
                        of the population lived in them.</p>
                        <p>In the 18th to 20th centuries the cities of Russia became the
                        focus of science and progressive Russian culture: the
                        Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg (founded in 1725) and
                        the universities in Moscow (1755), Kazan (1804), Kharkov
                        (1805), and St Petersburg (1819), the development of book
                        publishing, and the appearance of the periodical press and
                        professional theaters in Yaroslavl and Moscow.</p>
                        <p>With the growth of the proletariat, cities became the centers
                        of the revolutionary movement. All the main political
                        events of the two Russian bourgeois-democratic revolutions
                        (the Revolution of 1905-07 and the February Bourgeois-Democratic
                        Revolution of 1917) took place in the cities. Petrograd
                        and Moscow were the main centers of the Great October
                        Socialist Revolution of 1917, which spread to all cities
                        of the country as a result of the triumphant march of Soviet
                        power.</p>
                        <p>After the victory of the October Revolution private ownership
                        of land in the cities was abolished (Oct 26 [Nov 8],
                        1917), and on Aug 20, 1918, private ownership of real property
                        in the cities was abolished. All so called income buildings
                        were taken from private ownership and transferred to
                        the local Soviets. In 1918-24 millions of working people were
                        moved by Soviet power from basements and slums into the
                        homes of the bourgeoisie (in Moscow alone 500,000 out of 1.7
                        million residents were moved to new apartments). The city
                        system came under the management of the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The industrialization of the country became the primary
                        factor determining growth in Soviet cities and their economic
                        and cultural role. During the years of the prewar five-year
                        plans (1929-40), more than 500 new cities formed in the
                        USSR (including Magnitogorsk, Berezniki, Komsomol'sk
                        na-Amure, Elektrostal, Noril'sk, Magadan Karaganda, and
                        Igarka). Many cities, including Sverdlovsk, Cheliabinsk,
                        Novosibirsk, Kuibyshev, and Saratov were transformed
                        into major industrial centers. Plans were drawn up for rebuilding
                        work on dozens of old cities, among them the capitals
                        of the national republics. Residential buildings were
                        provided with amenities, and schools, nursery schools, childcare
                        centers, clubs, libraries, stores, polyclinics, hospitals,
                        theaters, stadiums, and recreational parks were built. The
                        social composition of the cities changed, the difference between
                        the well-organized center and the outlying workers'
                        settlements, which is typical of capitalist cities, was eliminated.
                        Soviet cities are characterized by a new social composition
                        of the population production workers, clerical
                        workers, and intelligentsia Shock working and the
                        Stakhanovite movement were born in the cities. The cities
                        were the centers of the socialist cultural revolution.</p>
                        <p>During the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45 the residents of
                        Leningrad and the defenders of Moscow, Stalingrad (now
                        Volgograd), Sevastopol, Odessa, Kiev, and the Brest Fortress
                        showed heroism and selflessness. The honorary title of
                        Hero City has been awarded to six large cities in the USSR
                        that earned glory by their heroic defense during the war. In
                        the Soviet cities that were occupied by the fascists, 1,209,000
                        residential buildings out of 2,567,000, as well as 32,000 large
                        and medium industrial enterprises, 82,000 schools, and tens
                        of thousands of hospitals, museums, and stores, were destroyed.

                        recognizes the value of ihe human being as an individual and
                        his right to liberty, happiness and the opportunity to develop
                        and express his capabilities. It regards human welfare as the

                        principles of equality justice and humaneness as the desired
                        norm in relations between people.</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>The conceptions of humanism have a lengthy history. The
                        motifs of humaneness and the love of humanity as well as
                        dreams of happiness and justice can be found in the works of
                        oral folklore in literature and in the moral philosophical and
                        religious concepts of various peoples beginning with the most
                        ancient times. But as the system of views humanism first took
                        shape in the age of the Renaissance. It appeared at that
                        time as a broad current of social thought embracing
                        philosophy, philology, literature and art and leaving its
                        mark upon the consciousness of the epoch. Humanism took
                        shape in the struggle against feudal ideology, religious dogmatism
                        and the spiritual dictatorship of the church. In reviving
                        many literary monuments of classical antiquity, the
                        humanists used them to develop a secular culture and educational
                        standaid. To theological and scholastic knowledge
                        they counterposed secular knowledge, to religious ascetism
                        they counterposed the enjoyment of life and instead of the
                        deprecation of man they upheld the ideal of the free, well
                        rounded personality.</p>
                        <p>In the 14th and l5th centuries the center of humanist
                        thought was in Italy where it was represented by such
                        figures as Petrarch, Boccaccio, Lorenzo Valla, Pico della
                        Mirandola, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Michelangelo.
                        Subsequently humanism spread to other European countries
                        together with the Reformation. Many great thinkers and artists
                        of that time made their contributions to the development
                        of humanism, for example Montaigne and Rabelais in
                        France, Shakespeare and F. Bacon in England, L. Vives and
                        Cervantes in Spain, U. Hutten and A Durer in Germany,
                        and Erasmus of Rotterdam. The humanism of the Renaissance
                        was one of the main expressions of the upheaval in
                        culture and in world outlook which reflected the initial formation
                        of capitalist relations. The further development of the
                        ideas of humanism is connected with the social thought of the
                        period of bourgeois revolutions in the 17th, 18th and early
                        19th century. The ideologists of the nascent bourgeoisie developed
                        the ideas of the natural rights of man, put forward
                        as a criterion determining the suitability of a social system,
                        its correspondence to abstract human nature and sought
                        to discover ways of combining individual welfare and the
                        interests of society by reiving on the theory of enlightened
                        self interest or the concept of individual interest correctly
                        understood. The French Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th
                        century such as P. Holbach, C. A. Helvetius and D. Diderot
                        clearly linked humanism to materialism and atheism.
                        Several of the principles of humanism were developed in
                        German classical philosophy. I. Kant put forward the idea of
                        a lasting peace and formulated the postulate that is the essence
                        of humanism - that a person can only be a goal for
                        another and never a means. To be sure, Kant believed that,
                        the practical realization of these principles would take place
                        in the indefinite future.</p>
                        <p>The system of humanist views that developed under conditions
                        of rising capitalism constituted a great achievement for
                        social thought. Nevertheless, the system was internally inconsistent
                        and historically limited for it was based on an
                        individualistic concept of personality and an abstract notion
                        of the human being. This contradictoriness of abstract
                        humanism came out sharply with the consolidation of
                        capitalism - a system in which human beings are turned into
                        a means of production of capital in direct opposition to the
                        ideals of humanism; a system in which man is subjected to
                        the domination of uncontrolled social forces and laws hostile
                        to him and to the capitalist division of labor that deforms the
                        personality and renders it one-sided. The domination of private
                        property and the division of labor give rise to various
                        forms of human alienation. This shows that the principles of
                        humanism cannot become the norms of human relations on
                        the basis of private property. Criticizing private property,
                        T. More, T. Campanella, Morelli and G. Mably held the
                        view that only if private property was replaced by communal
                        ownership would humanity be able to attain happiness and
                        well being. Such ideas are earned further by the great Utopian
                        socialists Saint Simon C. Fourier and R. Owen who
                        recognized the contradictions in the already existing
                        capitalist system and inspired bv the ideals of humanism,
                        worked out projects for reforming society on socialist princi-<pb n="551" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.551"/>
                        ples. However, they were unable to find any practical ways
                        for the building of socialist society and their concepts of the
                        future contain much that is fantastic together with insights of
                        genius. The humanist tradition in Russian social thought in
                        the 19th century was represented by such revolutionary
                        democrats as A. I. Herzen, V. 0. Belinsky, N. G. Chernyshevsky,
                        A. N. Dobroliubov and T. G. Shevchenko. The
                        authors of the great classical works of Russian literature of
                        the 19th century were also inspired by humanist ideas.</p>
                        <p>A new stage in the development of humanism began with
                        the emergence of Marxism which rejected the abstract
                        nonhistorical interpretation that viewed human nature as
                        a solely biological substance of the genus. Instead
                        Marxism presented a scientific histoncally concrete concept
                        of human nature, showing that human nature is the
                        totality of all social relations (<bibl>

                                </title>, 2nd ed, vol 3 p 3</bibl>) Marxism rejected the abstract
                        supraclass approach to the problems of humanism and placed
                        them instead on a realistic historical foundation formulating
                        a new conception of humanism that of proletarian or
                        socialist humanism, which included in itself all the best
                        achievements of humanist thought of the past. Marx first
                        showed the realistic way toward realizing the ideals of
                        humanism by linking it with the scientific theory of
                        social development with the revolutionary movement of the
                        proletariat, and with the struggle for communism.
                        Communisn eliminates private property and the exploitation of
                        man by man, national oppression and racial discrimination
                        and social antagonisms and wars. It overcomes all forms of
                        alienation, places the achievements of science and culture
                        at the service of humanity and creates the material
                        social, and spiritual preconditions for the harmonious and
                        all - around development of the free human personality.
                        Under communism labor is transformed from a means to
                        life into the primary need of 1ife and the highest aim of
                        society becomes the development of the individual himself.
                        That is why Marx termed communism realistic and practical
                        humanism. (See <bibl>

                        <p>The opponents of communism deny the humanist nature of
                        Marxism on the grounds that it bases itself on materialism
                        and embraces the theory of class. struggle This criticism is
                        not valid for materialism which recognizes the value of life on
                        earth, is oriented toward transforming life in the interests
                        of man, while the Marxist theory of class struggle as an irreplaceable
                        means of solving social problems during the transition
                        to socialism does not at all constitute an apology for
                        Violence. This theory justifies the unavoidable use of revolutionary
                        violence in order to suppress the resistance of
                        the minority in the interests of the majority under those conditions
                        where the solution to social problems that have
                        reached a critical state would otherwise be impossible. The
                        Marxist world view is at one and the same time critical in a
                        revolutionary way and humanistic. The ideas of Marxist
                        humanism were made even more specific in the works of
                        V. I. Lenin, who studied the new era of capitalist development,
                        the revolutionary processes of that era and the beginning
                        of the stage of transition from capitalism to socialism,
                        when these ideas began to actually be realized.</p>
                        <p>Socialist humanism is the opposite of abstract humanism
                        which preaches a humanen as in general with no regard
                        for the struggle for true emancipation of man from all forms
                        of exploitation. But within the confines of abstract humanism
                        two fundamental tendencies can be distinguished. On the one
                        hand the ideas of abstract humanism are used in order to
                        disguise the antihumanistic character of modern capitalism,
                        to criticize socialism to struggle against the communist
                        world view, and to falsify socialist humanism. On the other
                        hand, there are strata and groups in bourgeois society who
                        adhere to the ideas of abstract humanism but have a critical
                        attitude toward capitalism, favor peace and democracy, and
                        are concerned about the future of humanity. The two world
                        wars unleashed by imperialism, the inhuman theory and
                        practice of fascism (which openly trampled on the principles
                        of humanism), racism, militarism, the arms race and the
                        threat of nuclear war hanging over the world - all this taken
                        together poses the problems of humanism ever so sharply
                        before humanity. People who take the standpoint of abstract
                        humanism to oppose imperialism and the social ills that it
                        gives rise to are to a certain extent the allies of revolutionary
                        socialist humanism in the struggle for true happiness for man.</p>
                        <p>The right and <q>'left"</q> revisionists distort the principles of
                        Marxist and socialist humanism. Both types of revisionists
                        actually identify socialist humanism with abstract humanism.
                        But while the right revisionists see in abstract humanist principles
                        the essence of Marxism in general, a left' revisionist
                        rejects any kind of humanism as being a bourgeois concept.
                        But life itself has shown the correctness of the principles of
                        socialist humanism. With the victory of socialism first in the
                        USSR and subsequently in other countries of the socialist
                        commonwealth, the ideas of Marxist humanism have been
                        confirmed in real and practical ways by the humanist gains of
                        the new social structure, which has chosen as the motto for
                        its further development the humanist principle: <q>"Everything 
                        for the sake of man and for the good of man".</q>

                        class society.</gloss>In a broader sense, the state is the political
                        form of the organization of social life, which is created as a
                        result of the rise and activity of public authority - a particular
                        ruling system exercising management over the basic spheres
                        of social life and depending, if necessary, on force. Because
                        the state is constructed along territorial lines, the term is
                        sometimes imprecisely used as a synonym for <q>"country"</q>.
                        Various types of state are known: slaveholding, feudal,
                        bourgeois, and socialist. The different forms of state organization
                        are monarchy (absolute and constitutional), republic
                        (parliamentary and presidential), soviet republic, unitary
                        state, and federated state (federation). By mid-1971 there
                        were approximately 150 states.</p>
                        <p>The basic features of the state are as follows. (1) There is a
                        particular system of organs and institutions that together
                        form the machinery of the state. (The coercive apparatus,
                        that is, the police, the army, and so forth, has a specific place
                        in this machinery.) The state, according to <cit>

                        The state
                        machinery has become more and more complex and ramified,
                        as the life of society has become more complex in its
                        sociopolitical and technological-economic aspects. (2) There
                        are laws, that is, obligatory rules of behavior established or
                        sanctioned by the state. With the help of the laws, the state,
                        as the political authority, consolidates a definite system of
                        social relations, as well as the structure and system of activity
                        of the state machinery. (3) The state authority is limited to
                        the area within the borders of a definite geographical territory.
                        Acting as a territorial organization, the state has actively
                        assisted the process of forming nations.</p>
                        <p>The state is the fundamental, but not the sole, political
                        institution of class society; in a developed society, besides
                        the state, there are various parties, unions, religious bodies,
                        and other organizations, which, together with the state, form
                        the political organization of society. What distinguishes the
                        state from the other political institutions of class society is
                        the fact that it has supreme authority (the sovereignty of
                        state power). The supremacy of state power is concretely
                        expressed in its universality (it extends to the entire population
                        and to all public organizations of the country), its
                        prerogatives (it can abolish any manifestation of any other
                        public authority), and its possession of certain means of influence
                        that no other public authority has (for example, it has
                        a monopoly on legislation and justice).</p>
                        <p>The state is a social phenomenon restricted by a definite
                        historical framework. The state did not exist in the primitive
                        communal system. It arose as a result of the social division of
                        labor, the appearance of private property, and the division of
                        society into classes. Economically the ruling classes require
                        for the defense of their privileges and the consolidation of the
                        system of exploitation a special authoritative mechanism of
                        political domination, which takes the form of the state and its
                        apparatus. With the appearance of the state, this mechanism
                        no longer coincides with society, but, so to speak, stands
                        above it and is supported by it (through taxes and collections).
                        Although there are vast differences in the historical
                        forms of the state, of its power, and of the organization of its
                        apparatus, its essence, and the nature of its relationship with
                        society - it always represents the political power of the ruling
                        class (class dictatorship). 
                        Classes that own the means of pro-<pb n="651" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0651"/>
                        duction achieve political domination with the assistance of
                        the state, and thus they consolidate their economic and social
                        supremacy within the society and in its relations with other
                        states and countries.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the state is ultimately defined by the character of
                        productive relations and the mode of production as a whole;
                        it is the superstructure of the economic base. The genesis of
                        the state and the transition from one historical type of state to
                        another cannot be understood and explained outside of this
                        relationship. In the course of history, the state acquires an
                        important, although relative, independence from the
                        economic base. Its independent influence on the basic elements
                        of social life (including the economy) and on the historical
                        and social processes is extremely strong and is realized in
                        different ways - that is, the state can promote the development
                        of social relations, or it can hamper this development.
                        As the state-organized society becomes more complex, the
                        role of this influence becomes more important.</p>
                        <p>Over a prolonged period of the history of antagonistic class
                        formations the state has existed as the instrument of the
                        supremacy of the propertied minority over the exploited
                        majority. The basic function of this type of state has consisted
                        of the consolidation and defense of economic and political
                        exploitation and the supremacy of the propertied classes,
                        as well as the suppression of resistance by the unpropertied
                        mass of people. In relation to the ruling class, the state is a
                        specific agency administering the common affairs of individuals
                        and groups of this class; whereas in relation to the
                        working classes, that is, the majority of the population, the
                        state is an instrument of suppression. At the same time, the
                        state, as the official representative of society and the ruling
                        system, cannot fail to carry out also general social activity,
                        which is needed to support the necessary conditions of existence
                        of a civilized human community (the organization of
                        transport, communications, education, health care, and so
                        forth). In this connection, Marx distinguished in the activity

                        <p>Prebourgeois sociopolitical thought advanced a different
                        kind of religious-theocratic concept of the state, as well as
                        the so-called <q>"patriarchal theory"</q>, according to which the
                        state is the continuation of the father's authority in the family.
                        However, this theory, as a rule, did not distinguish between
                        society and the state. Bourgeois science did not give a

                            </cit>. A fundamental
                        aspect of the approach of bourgeois science to the state is
                        its rejection of the concept of the state as an instrument of
                        class supremacy in general and as the instrument of the class
                        domination of the capital. The widely disseminated definition
                        of the state in bourgeois literature as the combination
                        of power, population, and territory is superficial,
                        formal, and incomplete, precisely because it ignores class
                        supremacy as the constructive factor that unites these
                        three entities into the concept of the state. Advocates of the
                        organic theory of the state depict it as a peculiar living organism
                        and apply biological laws to it, thus justifying as
                        natural phenomena the oppression of the masses by the
                        exploiting state, on the one hand, and the expansionist tendencies
                        of the state, on the other. Another tendency, the
                        so-called juridical school, conceals the socioeconomic basis
                        of the state behind its juridical interpretation and considers
                        the state exclusively as a legal phenomenon (<q>"the juridical
                        embodiment of the nation,"</q>
                            <q>"the personification of the legal
                        order,"</q> and so forth). Frankly idealistic attempts have been
                        repeatedly undertaken to interpret the state as the result of
                        particular spiritual principles, <q>"the idea of the state"</q>. The
                        psychological concept of the state predominates in contemporary
                        bourgeois political science; this explains the state
                        by the presence in the human psyche of strivings, or <q>"impulses"</q>,
                        for power and submission.</p>
                        <p>A genuinely scientific doctrine of the state was originated
                        by Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Its formulation revealed the
                        essence of the state as a social phenomenon and established
                        its inherent, qualitative features, its basic purposes and functions,
                        its role in class society, and the reflection of its essence
                        in various forms and political regimes. The Marxist doctrine
                        of the state, revealing the regularity of the development of
                        the state in the course of changes in sociohistorical formations
                        is an important starting point for the theory of socialist
                        revolution and the path of the communist transformation of
                        society.</p>
                        <p>A definite historical type of state corresponds to each class
                        socioeconomic formation. The change to a new type of state
                        is a regular process in the liquidation of obsolete forms of the
                        state organization of society, which are paralyzing its development,
                        and their replacement by a new state system that
                        promotes the formation and consolidation of a more advanced
                        social system. Therefore, the functions of each of the
                        subsequent types of state, the methods of the fulfillment of
                        these functions, and the political forms of the state are richer
                        and more complex than the organization of the political
                        power in the preceding formations.</p>
                        <p>The slaveholding state was the first state in history. It was
                        a dictatorship of the class of slaveholders. The essence of this
                        state reflected the first important class division of society -
                        the division into slaves and slaveholders. The slaveholding
                        state originated during the period between 4000 and 3000
                        B.C, when states were formed in ancient Egypt, in ancient
                        China, and on the territory of Mesopotamia. The states of the
                        ancient East are in this category (for example, ancient Egypt,
                        Babylonia, and Assyria). In these states, remnants of the
                        primitive communal system were preserved. The peculiarities
                        of the development of the productive forces (such
                        as the need to construct and maintain irrigation installations)
                        underlay the rather significant economic role of the
                        state in these countries, where despotism or despotic monarchy
                        was the characteristic form of government. The system
                        of the slaveholding state attained its most complete development
                        in the ancient states of Greece and Rome. There were
                        various forms of government in the advanced slaveholding
                        states: monarchy in the Roman Empire, an aristocratic republic
                        in Sparta, and a democratic republic in Athens. However,
                        despite this variety in forms of government, any state of

                        <p>The feudal state arose in connection with the onset of
                        feudal productive relations. It arose in Europe in the period
                        from the fifth to the 11th century. The basis of feudal
                        society was the property of the feudal lord in land, and the
                        feudal state was a dictatorship of the class of feudal lords.
                        The fundamental form of government of the feudal state was
                        the monarchy in all its variants. The early feudal monarchy
                        was characteristic of the period of feudal splintering, when,
                        in the face of a weak central power, there were numerous
                        independent or semi-independent states (principalities, seigneuries,
                        and so forth). In the process of the centralization of
                        state power, the estate-representative monarchy
                        was formed.<pb n="652" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0652"/>
                        The wealthy elements in the cities were one of the supports
                        of the central power in this process; as a result, organs of
                        estate representation arose (national assemblies, or Zemskii
                        Sobors, in Russia, the estates general in France, the parliament
                        in England, and so forth). The last historical form of the
                        feudal state was the absolute monarchy, which developed
                        during the period when feudal splintering was overcome once
                        and for all, and the process of the formation of the centralized
                        state was culminated. In an absolute monarchy, the supreme
                        power is vested autocratically and without limitation in the
                        monarch, without any participation of the people in the legislation
                        or the control of the administration. In the feudal era
                        there were distinct states called city-states, in which the republican
                        form of government was established (for example,
                        Novgorod, Pskov, Venice, Genoa, and Florence). Power belonged
                        to the wealthy elite of the population (the urban aristocracy,
                        or patricianate) in the city-states; its representatives
                        formed the city council (senate), which elected the higher
                        officials. The city-states generally arose along the most
                        important trade routes; handicrafts and commerce were best
                        developed in them, and capitalist relations first took shape in
                        them. Characteristic of all states of the feudal type was the
                        enormous role of the church as a political and ideological
                        force in feudal society, furthering the maintenance and consolidation
                        of the feudal lords' predominance over the mass of
                        the exploited population.</p>
                        <p>The bourgeois state arose as the result of the bourgeois
                        revolution directed against the feudal-absolutist monarchy
                        and feudal productive relations. Where the bourgeoisie, in
                        the course of these revolutions, agreed to compromises with
                        the nobility (for example, in Great Britain), the bourgeois
                        state took the form of a constitutional monarchy; on the other
                        hand, where the bourgeoisie attained relatively complete
                        supremacy, the state took the form of a democratic republic.
                        Later, too, the plurality of forms of government of the
                        bourgeois state remained a characteristic feature of this type
                        of state, although the differences in these forms were substantially
                        smoothed over. <cit>

                        <p>The bourgeois state of the premonopolistic period of
                        capitalism is characterized by the following features. (1)
                        There are voting qualifications, which eliminate, on the basis
                        of property and other criteria, the participation of broad
                        strata of the population in the creation of the organs of state
                        power. Representing a significant step forward from
                        feudalism, bourgeois democracy and its basic institutions
                        (such as parliamentarianism and the principle of equality) are
                        of a formal, limited, and class character. (2) The basic efforts
                        of the state are concentrated chiefly on political functions,
                        including the guarding of the interests of the ruling classes by
                        the military and the police inside and outside the country.
                        The state of this period is considered the <q>"policeman"</q> or
                        <q>"night watchman,"</q> protecting the capitalist system but not
                        intervening directly in its functioning. (3) Within the
                        mechanism of the state, an important position is maintained
                        for the nobility and landowners. The bourgeois revolution, as
                        a rule, did not smash the old state machinery, which gradually
                        adapted itself to the needs of the capitalist system.</p>
                        <p>An enormous growth in the apparatus of the bourgeois
                        state occurs in the era of imperialism, and especially during
                        the general crisis of capitalism. The influence of the state on
                        the basic elements of social life increases, and its functions
                        expand. These processes are connected, above all, with the
                        intensification of class contradictions. The growth of the consciousness
                        and organization of the working class and the
                        other toiling layers of the population and the widespread
                        dissemination of communist ideas lead, on the one hand, to
                        an increase in the level of class struggle and a broadening of
                        the antimonopolistic and democratic movements, and on the
                        other hand, to a consistent narrowing of the social base of the
                        political supremacy of capital. In these conditions, the
                        monopolies strengthen in every possible way the basic instrument
                        of their supremacy - the state, with its military and
                        police apparatus. The reinforcement of the role of the state is
                        connected with militarism and the development of state
                        monopoly capitalism.</p>
                        <p>In the conditions of state monopoly capitalism, with the
                        increasing complexity of the technological-productive aspect
                        of society as a result of the scientific-technological revolution,
                        coupled with the expansion of the functions of coercion,
                        the economic functions of the bourgeois state reach an important
                        level, and so does the state's ideological activity inside
                        and outside the country. State monopoly capitalism
                        unites the monopolies and the state into one mechanism, with
                        the aims of saving the capitalist system, enriching the
                        monopolies, suppressing the workers' movement and the national
                        liberation struggle, and unleashing aggressive wars.
                        Monopoly capital no longer shares political power with any
                        other force; the bourgeois state comes forward as the organ
                        for the administration of the affairs of the monopolistic
                        bourgeoisie. The process of the coalescence of the monopolies
                        with the top circles of the state apparatus reaches its
                        height.</p>
                        <p>The turn of monopoly capital from bourgeois democracy to
                        reaction is a result of the narrowing of the social base of the
                        state and the utilization by the working class and other toiling
                        layers of the institutions of bourgeois democracy. This turn
                        exerts a substantial influence on the political regime established
                        by the bourgeois state and on its forms of government.
                        Its clearest expression is the establishment of the fascist totalitarian
                        state system. (The classic example of such a state
                        was Nazi Germany.) However, even with the preservation of
                        bourgeois democratic forms of government, authoritarian
                        tendencies toward the rule of a <q>"strong man"</q> appear, the
                        role of the government and its apparatus increase while the
                        authority of the elected parliament declines, and a campaign
                        is waged against the democratic rights and liberties of citizens
                        and organizations. But the authoritarian course of the
                        monopolistic bourgeoisie comes up against the opposition of
                        the broad popular masses, led by the working class, acting to
                        defend and expand the democratic rights they have won. This
                        provokes an intensification of the class contradictions of
                        bourgeois society.</p>
                        <p>The foreign policy of the imperialist state is characterized
                        by a striving for expansion. This tendency of monopoly capital
                        has twice in the 20th century plunged mankind into devastating
                        world wars. The imperialist states conduct subversive
                        activity (including ideological) against the socialist countries;
                        they seek new forms of neocolonialist exploitation of the
                        states of Asia, Africa, and Latin America that have embarked
                        on the path of independence.</p>
                        <p>The expansion of the imperialist state's economic activity
                        is portrayed by bourgeois ideologues as a radical transformation
                        and its conversion into a "welfare state." The increasing
                        complexity of the political structure of contemporary
                        capitalism (the growth of the role of political parties, trade
                        unions, and other unions and organizations) is depicted as a
                        process of the <q>"diffusion of power"</q>. In reality, the imperialist
                        state has been and remains the basic instrument of
                        the class domination of the imperialist bourgeoisie; it acts as
                        a force attempting to retard social progress and to perpetuate
                        outmoded capitalist social relations.</p>
                        <p>In the era of the downfall of colonialism many independent
                        states were formed in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and
                        the colonial and semicolonial countries struggled for their
                        national independence. A significant number of the young
                        independent states, in their economic and social features
                        (such as the mixed nature of their economies), cannot be
                        placed among the basic types of state. Some of these states
                        have embarked on a noncapitalist path of development,
                        orienting toward the perspective of constructing a socialist
                        society. In these states, serious economic and social trans-<pb n="653" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol07.0653"/>
                        formations are being realized - for example, the carrying out
                        of democratic agrarian reforms, the creation of a state sector
                        of the economy, and the nationalization of the property of
                        foreign monopolies.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the socialist revolution, which entails the
                        destruction of the exploitative apparatus of the state, a fundamentally
                        new type of state arises - the socialist state. The
                        prototype of the socialist state, the first organization of the
                        state power of the working people led by the working class
                        was the Paris Commune of 1871. As a result of the victory of
                        the Great October Socialist Revolution in 1917, the Soviet
                        state arose - the first state of the working people in the
                        World - and it established the dictatorship of the proletariat.
                        In 1924 the Mongolian People's Republic embarked on the
                        path of socialist development. The defeat of German and
                        Italian fascism and Japanese militarism in World War II
                        (1939-45) promoted an intense growth in the revolutionary
                        and national liberation movements all over the world and led
                        to the triumph of popular democratic revolutions in a number
                        of European and Asian countries and to the rise of the democratic
                        people's state. The formation of these states signified
                        that socialism was becoming transformed into a worldwide
                        system. In 1959, Cuba entered this system and became the
                        first socialist state in the Americas.</p>
                        <p>The fundamentally new essence of the socialist state in
                        comparison with the exploitative types of states could not fail
                        to elicit new organizations of state power. The first form of
                        the socialist state was the republic of Soviets founded by
                        Lenin. The system of elected (from top to bottom) Soviets,
                        built on the principle of democratic centralism and invested
                        with absolute state power, was, within the actual historical
                        context, the political organization that united all working
                        people without exception and that represented the best opportunity
                        for state leadership by the masses as represented
                        by the working class and its party. In the people's democracies
                        the forms of political organization had a number of
                        features different from those of the Soviets (for example, the
                        presence of such sociopolitical organizations as the national,
                        or patriotic, front; and two or more parties), caused by the
                        historical peculiarities of the formation of the dictatorship of
                        the proletariat in these countries. The variety of forms of the
                        socialist state confirms the Leninist thesis <cit>

                        <p>The socialist transformation of society places various tasks
                        before the state of the proletarian dictatorship, depending on
                        the level of development of the economy, the culture, the
                        social structure, and the national peculiarities and traditions
                        of each country. However, independently of the specific
                        conditions in a given country, in the transitional period from
                        capitalism to socialism every proletarian dictatorship faces
                        tasks that result from the very essence of this period: the
                        suppression of resistance by the overthrown exploiting classes,
                        the liquidation of private property in the basic means of
                        production, the creation of the economic basis for socialism
                        (socialist industrialization, the socialist transformation of agriculture,
                        and the creation of a socialist system of economy),
                        the formation of socialist culture, the education of the new
                        man, and the securing of the country's defense capability. To
                        meet these tasks, the state carries out a number of external
                        and internal functions: economic-organizational activities,
                        cultural-educational activities, the control of labor and consumption
                        standards, the defense of socialist legality and
                        socialist property, the defense of the country against outside
                        attack, and the struggle for peaceful coexistence among
                        states with different social systems. The functions of the
                        socialist state expand and change with the development of
                        the socioeconomic structure of society and with the successes
                        of socialist construction. Thus, as a result of the liquidation
                        of the exploiting classes in the USSR, the state's function
                        in the suppression of the resistance of these classes has
                        lost its meaning. In carrying outfits functions, the socialist
                        state acts as the main instrument of the construction of
                        socialism and communism and represents the political organization
                        of the overwhelming majority of the population. In
                        the process of the socialist state's development, its social
                        base constantly expands and it becomes more and more the
                        representative of the interests of the entire people.</p>
                        <p>After the complete and final victory of socialism, the dictatorship
                        of the proletariat, having fulfilled its historical mission
                        from the point of view of the internal development of the
                        country, ceases to be necessary, and the proletarian state is
                        naturally transformed into an organ of expression of the interests
                        and the will of the entire people - the all-national state
                        (see <ref>Program of the CPSU, 1971, p. 101</ref>). The socialist state
                        has reached such a stage of development in the USSR, where
                        it operates as the political organization of the entire people
                        under the leadership of the working class headed by its vanguard,
                        the Communist Party. The social role of the soviet
                        all-national socialist state is steadily growing. The resolutions
                        of the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the CPSU (1971) emphasized
                        the role of the soviet state in solving internal and
                        external problems facing soviet society at the present stage of
                        the construction of communism. Functions of the socialist
                        state such as the economic, organizational and cultural-educational
                        functions have significantly expanded. (The essence
                        of these functions at the present stage, was defined by
                        the directives of the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the CPSU
                        on the five-year plan for the development of the national
                        economy of the USSR from 1971-75.)</p>
                        <p>Contemporary revisionists criticize the Marxist-Leninist
                        doctrine of the socialist state, advancing the hypothesis of
                        the necessity for the disappearance of the state immediately
                        after the conquest of political power. This conception is objectively
                        directed at weakening the socialist states. At the
                        same time, left-wing revisionists fight for overcentralization,
                        and the bureaucratization of all government life.</p>
                        <p>Under conditions of communist construction, the entire
                        political system of the USSR is constantly being improved.
                        Proletarian democracy is being transformed into all-national
                        democracy, whose development is characterized in the Program
                        of the CPSU as the main direction of the socialist state
                        system. One of the leading principles of the socialist state's
                        activity is the broad involvement of the toiling people in the
                        work of the state organs.</p>
                        <p>Marx and Engels revealed the historical perspective of the
                        proletarian state. They asserted that under communism the
                        need for a state would disappear, and therefore the proletarian
                        state itself would gradually wither away, although this
                        did not mean every public authority in general would disappear.
                        By the withering away of the state, they meant the
                        elimination of the special apparatus of coercion, the public
                        political authority. Marx and Engels considered a level of the
                        development of productive forces under which it would be
                        possible to realize the principle of communism, <q>"from each
                        according to his abilities, to each according to his needs"</q> as
                        the economic precondition for the withering away of the
                        state.</p>
                        <p>Lenin emphasized the radical contrast between the proletarian
                        dictatorship, which is a dictatorship of the majority
                        of the population, and the states of the exploiting type. He

                            <p>Europe is bordered on the north by the Arctic Ocean and
                             its seas - the Kara, Barents, White, and Norwegian seas. In
                             the west and south it is washed by the Atlantic Ocean and
                             its seas - the Baltic, North, Irish, Mediterranean, and Black
                             seas and the seas of Marmara and Azov. In the east and
                             southeast the border between Europe and Asia is most commonly
                             accepted as passing through the eastern foothills of the
                             Urals and along the Emba River to the Caspian Sea and along
                             the Kuma and Manych rivers to the mouth of the Don. The
                             extreme continental points of Europe are in the north, North
                             Cape, 71°08' N lat., in the south, Point Marroqui, 36° N lat.,
                             in the west, Capa da Roca, 9°34' W long., and in the east,
                             the eastern foothills of the polar Urals near Baidaratak Bay,
                             67°20' E long. Europe also has islands and archipelagoes,
                             the largest of which are Novaia Zemlia, Franz Josef Land
                             (Cape Fligeli on Rodol'f Island is the northernmost point of
                             Europe, at 81°49' N lat.), Svalbard, Iceland, the British Isles,
                             Zeeland, the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and
                             Crete. Within the borders defined above, the area of Europe,
                             including its islands, is approximately 10 million sq km. The
                             area of the islands alone is approximately 730,000 sq km.</p>
                            <p>In some geographic as well as statistical and economic
                             works, the Caucasus (including Ciscaucasia and Transcaucasia
                             as far as the state borders of the USSR) are treated as
                             part of Europe.</p>
                            <p>It is a commonly accepted practice to divide Europe into
                             two major parts: Eastern Europe (most of the European
                             territory of the USSR) and Western Europe (most of the non-
                             Soviet area of Europe).</p>

                                </hi>Compared to other parts of the world, Europe is
                             outstanding for the great diversity of its coastline: for every
                             1 km of coastline there is about 246 sq km of territory. The
                             total length of the coastline is approximately 38,000 km, and
                             the maximum distance of the interior regions of Europe from
                             the sea is 1,600 km. Peninsulas account for about 25 percent
                             of Europe's area. The major peninsulas are the Kanin, Kola,
                             Scandinavian, Iberian, Italian, Balkan, and Crimean peninsulas,
                             Jutland, and Brittany.</p>
                            <p>Smooth, regular, eroded coasts prevail, formed primarily
                             by the wave action of the sea (for example, the eastern shores
                             of the White Sea and the southeastern shores of the Barents
                             Sea, the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, the western coast
                             of the North Sea, the eastern coast of the Bay of Biscay,
                             and much of the coastlines of the Mediterranean and Black
                             seas). The southern and southeastern shores of the North
                             Sea and parts of the southern shore of the Barents Sea are
                             marshy, formed by the action of the tides on lowlands.</p>
                            <p>In the remaining regions of the continent, relatively high,
                             extremely dissected tectonic shores prevail, such as the
                             faulted coasts of the Kola Peninsula and the folded coasts
                             in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. The fiord and
                             cliff coasts of the Norwegian Sea, the northern part of the
                             Baltic Sea, and the shores of Scotland and Iceland were
                             formed by glaciers. A number of European coasts were
                             changed by intrusions of the sea (the ria coasts of the peninsulas
                             of Brittany, Wales, and western Ireland, the northwestern
                             part of the Iberian Peninsula, and the Dalmatian
                             coast in the western Balkan Peninsula).</p>

                             its maximum elevation (4,807 m, Mont Blanc, the Alps),
                             Europe lags behind the other continents, with the exception
                             of Australia. Approximately 60 percent of Europe's surface
                             is located at an elevation of less than 200 m. (In many instances,
                             the surface of the continent is below sea level. The
                             shores of the Caspian Sea are at -28 m, and several portions
                             of the shores of the North and Baltic seas are below sea
                             level.) Of the remaining surface, 24 percent is from 200 to
                             500 m above sea level, 10 percent is from 500 to 1,000 m, and
                             6 percent is at elevations of more than 1,000 m (including 1.5
                             percent at elevations higher than 2,000 m).</p>
                            <p>The distribution of surface elevations indicates the prevalence
                             of plains in Europe. Almost all of Eastern Europe and
                             the northern part of Central Europe are occupied by the
                             Eastern European (Russian) Plain and its extension in the
                             west - the Central European Plain. A considerable portion of
                             Fennoscandia is also occupied by plains, and in the remaining
                             regions of the continent, plains are scattered between the<pb n="146" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0146"/>
                             mountains (for example, the Central Danubian and Lower
                             Danubian plains).</p>
                            <p>In the extreme east lie the Ural Mountains, and in the
                             northwest, the Scandinavian uplands. The southern part of
                             Central Europe is ringed by belts of mountains that are small
                             in area and low in elevation: the French Massif Central, the
                             Vosges, the Black Forest, and the Rhenish Slate Mountains.
                             From the south these belts are framed by the highest mountains
                             in Europe - the Alps - as well as by the Carpathians.
                             Mountainous relief prevails in southern Europe: the Pyrenees,
                             the Andalusian Mountains, the Apennines, the Stara
                             Planina (Balkan Mountains), and the Dinaric, Rhodope, and
                             Pindus mountains.</p>

                             The predominance in
                             Europe of platform structures is manifested in the wide distribution
                             of plains, which are especially characteristic of
                             Eastern Europe. Located in the northwestern part of the
                             Eastern European Platform are the socle plains of Fennoscandia,
                             which were formed as a result of a prolonged denudation
                             (beginning in the Paleozoic period) of the surface of
                             the Baltic Shield. During the Pleistocene epoch the Fennoscandian
                             terrain was made more complex by the action of
                             glaciers that covered the area. Socle plains are also found in
                             the southern and eastern parts of Scandinavia, Finland, the
                             Kola Peninsula, and Karelia. Low plains (elevations up to
                             100-150 m) prevail, with thick but shallow tectonic dissection,
                             frequent drops in elevation, and widely distributed
                             morainic ridges, eskers, kames, and depressions, many of
                             which are filled with lakes.</p>
                            <p>Individual uplands and ridges (Småland, Suomenselkä,
                             Maanselkä, and Western Karelian highlands, the Vetrenyi
                             Poias, and the Keivy) and low and medium-height hills (the
                             Lovozerok Tundras and the Khibiny) correspond to the
                             zones of the greatest tectonic uplifts or to outcroppings of
                             very dense rocks. There are stratified and accumulation
                             plains on the European Platform and on the syneclises of the
                             Epipaleozoic platforms adjacent to it (in the south, the
                             Scythian Plain, and in the west, the Western European Plain).
                             These plains were formed by the prolonged accumulation of
                             sedimentary rocks of the platform bed, whose stratification
                             is primarily horizontal or monoclinal (the latter type is found
                             chiefly in the northwest).</p>
                            <p>In addition to overall flatness and low average elevation
                             (approximately 170 m), the surface of Europe is characterized
                             by a combination of uplands up to 300-400 m (the Central
                             Russian Valdai, Volga Region, Verkhniaia Kama, Bugul'-ma-Belebei,
                             and Severnye Uvaly uplands) and lowlands
                             (the Oka-Don Plain, the Black Sea Region, the Pechora, and
                             the Caspian Lowland, as well as the Trans-Volga Region
                             and the Central European Plain). The tectonic diversity of
                             the platform's base and the varying direction and scope of
                             neotectonic movements are reflected in the combination of
                             uplands and lowlands.</p>
                            <p>The northern regions of the stratified plains, which were
                             altered by Pleistocene glaciers, have numerous glacial and
                             aqueoglacial plains and glacial forms of terrain that were laid
                             down on the preglacial surface of ancient river valleys, water
                             divides, and cuesta ridges. In general, fewer glacial forms are
                             encountered as one moves south toward the boundaries of
                             maximum glaciation (Dnieper glaciation). Glacial terrain is
                             especially well preserved in the regions of the most recent
                             (Valdai) glaciation, which are characterized by recent
                             morainic ridges (for example, the Baltic ridges of the Valdai
                             Hills), basal morainic hills, and glacial lake lowlands. Plains
                             that lie between the boundaries of the maximal and the most

                             reworked by erosion and denudation. In these areas
                             gently rolling morainic plains and almost flat, sandy outwash
                             plains prevail (Poles'e, the Oka-Don Plain, and the southern
                             regions of the Central European Plain). The remnants of
                             ancient morainic ridges are also found in northern Byelorussia
                             and on the Smolensk-Moscow Upland.</p>
                            <p>Most of the nonglaciated regions of Europe are occupied
                             by stratified plains, with water-eroded reliefs characterized
                             by mature, broad, terraced, asymmetrical river valleys, as
                             well as by ravines, gullies, and comparatively flat water
                             divides. Particularly deep dissection caused by erosion characterizes
                             the Central Russian. Volga Region, Podolian, and
                             Dnieper Region uplands, most of which are covered by a
                             thick layer of loess and loessial loams. The Trans-Volga
                             Region, considerable areas of which lack loose top soil deposits,
                             are less dissected. Associated with the geologic
                             youth, low absolute elevation, and arid climate of the
                             Caspian Lowland (a marine accumulation plain that recently
                             emerged from below sea level) are predominantly flat surfaces.
                             Small sinkholes (1-5 m deep) and hollows are encountered
                             in the north. In the south, the terrain is more complex,
                             with clays and low sandy ridges (2-8 m high) and hillocks.
                             Located among the stratified plains of the Donetsk, Timansk,
                             and Chernyshev ridges are eroded and denuded uplands,
                             which are related to outcrops of the folded base. The
                             Dnieper and Azov uplands are socle plains partially buried
                             under a sedimentary cover.</p>
                            <p>Located in the western part of the Scandinavian Peninsula,
                             framing the Fennoscandian socle plains, are the regenerated
                             folded block and block Scandinavian mountains,
                             which were formed on the site of the structures of the
                             Caledonian Region and (in the south and southeast) the
                             Baltic Shield, which were uplifed and became peneplains
                             during the Cenozoic era. Flat-topped massifs - fjelds - prevail,
                             dissected by deep, trough-shaped valleys with steep
                             western and more gently sloping eastern sides. Topographical
                             features formed by glacial exaration are widespread on
                             the Scandinavian Peninsula. The highest peaks have an alpine
                             relief. The lower mountains in the northern part of Great
                             Britain have similar characteristics (the Scottish Highlands
                             and the Southern Uplands of Scotland).</p>
                            <p>Regions where Hercynian folded structures are widespread
                             have primarily rejuvenated, folded block mountains
                             of medium elevation. The best example of this type of terrain
                             is the Ural Mountains. Located in the Ural-Tien-Shan folded
                             region, they are a system of parallel ranges extending meridionally
                             and divided by longitudinal and lateral depressions,
                             which are occupied by river valleys. Prolonged, intensive
                             denudation resulted in the formation of a series of peneplains
                             in the Urals, and only neotectonic movements have
                             rejuvenated the mountainous terrain. Mountain ranges of low
                             and medium elevations prevail, with flat or domed peaks and
                             gently contoured slopes. The polar Urals and the Urals below
                             the arctic circle have mountain-glacial forms of terrain and
                             small glaciers.</p>
                            <p>In the Western European Hercynian Zone the low and
                             medium-height folded-block and block mountains and uplands,
                             which correspond to the anteclises of the folded
                             foundation (for example, the Massif Central of France, the
                             Armorican Massif, the Cambrian Mountains, the Vosges,
                             the Black Forest, the Rhenish Slate Mountains, the Bohemian
                             Massif, including the Ore Mountains, the Sudetes, and
                             the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands) underwent intensive tectonic
                             disintegration. In many places, these mountains
                             alternate with plains on grabens (the Upper Rhine and
                             Rhone lowlands) and with stratified, stepped cuesta plains
                             which are primarily related to syneclises of a folded foundation
                             (the Paris, London, and Thuringian basins and the
                             Swabian-Franconian Plain).</p>
                            <p>A diverse topography distinguishes the Alpine geosynclinal
                             folded region, whose mountainous relief is characterized
                             by folded and block-folded, alpine, medium-height and
                             high, linearly extended or arch-shaped curved mountain
                             ranges, with sharp watershed crests and well-developed
                             slopes and foothills. The highest of these mountains are the
                             Alps, whose orographic continuation in the northwest is the
                             Jura and in the northeast, the Carpathians, which subsequently
                             form a transition to the Stara Planina. In the southeast
                             the Alps run into the Dinaric and Pindus mountains
                             and the mountains of the Peloponnese and the island of
                             Crete, and in the south, they join the Apennine Mountains.
                             Also included in this type of mountainous relief are the
                             Pyrenees and the Andalusian and Crimean mountains. Water

                             processes played a considerable role in forming the terrain of
                             these mountains. A number of Pleistocene glaciers affected<pb n="147" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0147"/>

                             significant changes in the Alps. Karst forms are most typical
                             in the limestone regions of the Alps, the Jura, and the
                             Dinaric and Crimean mountains.</p>
                            <p>Also characteristic of European orography are regions of
                             medium-height and low block ranges and plateaus, which are
                             confined to the intermediate massifs of the Paleozoic era
                             and have a relatively level peak surface, deep tectonic
                             dissection, and steep slopes. (Examples of this type of relief
                             include the Rhodope and Rila mountains, the mountains of
                             Macedonia and eastern Greece, the Calabrian Apennines,
                             most of the mountains of Corsica and Sardinia, the Sierra

                             and the Cantabrian Mountains.)</p>
                            <p>A considerable part of Europe is occupied by stratified
                             and accumulation plains and plateaus of intermontane and
                             piedmont downwarps, in which geologic forms caused by
                             water erosion and accumulation prevail (the Central Danubian,

                             Europe is distinguished by
                             the high level and great complexity of the studies on its
                             geologic structure. It is located within the boundaries of the
                             Eastern European (Russian) or European Platform, which
                             has a folded foundation dating from the Precambrian era. In
                             the east (within the area of the Russian Platform), where it is
                             deeply submerged, and in the eastern part of the Baltic
                             Shield, where it protrudes on the surface, the foundation is
                             composed of Archean and early Proterozoic rocks. In the
                             west (southern Scandinavia, Denmark, and Great Britain)
                             late Proterozoic metamorphic rocks are widely developed.</p>
                            <p>After the consolidation of the foundation, which occurred
                             during the last 1.2-1.6 billion years, individual sections of the
                             platform were covered for long periods by seas and lagoons.
                             This led to the formation of a thick platform sheath, which
                             consists of sedimentary series from the end of the Proterozoic
                             era (Jotnian and Riphean), sandy clay strata of the
                             Cambrian and Ordovician periods and Silurian limestones.
                             Other components of the sheath include red saliferous and
                             limestone rocks of the Devonian period and thick continental
                             strata (with coal-bearing series) from the Carboniferous, Permian,
                             and Triassic periods. The late Triassic, Jurassic, and
                             Cretaceous deposits, as well as the Paleocene and Neocene
                             deposits that fill the deep depressions, usually to the edges of
                             the platform, are sometimes several kilometers thick. (The
                             Hamburg Depression is approximately 6 km thick.)</p>
                            <p>During specific tectonically active epochs (the Wendian
                             Devonian, Permian, and part of the Jurassic), volcanic activity
                             occurred on the Eastern European Platform, causing
                             the formation of basalts and other eruptive rocks. The Precambrian
                             platform of the Barents Sea lies north of the Eastern
                             European Platform, occupying the northern shelf of the
                             continent from Franz Josef Land to the Pechora Lowland.
                             Analogous to the Barents platform is the ancient platform
                             (Eria), which forms the edge of the shelf north of the
                             British Isles. Iceland and the island of Jan Mayen are heterogeneous
                             volcanic uplifts that originated during the Cenozoic
                             era on top of the northern part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</p>

                             Peninsula), which is made up of Riphean schistose series,
                             belongs to the region of Baikal folding.</p>

                             (from Svalbard through Bear Island, the Scandinavian mountains,
                             and the northern and western islands of Great Britain
                             and Ireland) is the Caledonian folded system, which originated
                             from deep geosynclinal downwarps during the early
                             Paleozoic and Prepaleozoic eras. Within this system thick
                             volcanogenic and sedimentary Cambrian, Ordovician, and
                             Silurian strata developed, whose cross-section is topped by
                             thick red Devonian molasse. The system is characterized by
                             complex folding and an abundance of magmatic formations.
                             Scotland and Norway have well-known overthrust sheets
                             with a horizontal displacement as high as 100-120 km. In
                             Scotland the overthrusts extend toward the northwest, in the
                             direction of the Eria Platform, whereas in Norway they
                             stretch to the southwest toward the Baltic Shield.</p>
                            <p>South of the Caledonian folded system extend the Hercynian
                             folded structures, which are partly covered by a
                             sheath of slightly faulted Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata.
                             The Hercynian structures protrude on the surface of the
                             Iberian Peninsula, as well as in the Massif Central and the
                             Armorican Massif in France, the mountains of southern
                             Wales, the Ardennes, the Vosges, the Black Forest, the
                             Harz and Ore mountains, the Bohemian Massif, the Sudetes,
                             the Silesian mountains, and the Svientokrzyz Mountains. A
                             great number of massifs are located within the Hercynian
                             zone, including the Bohemian Massif and the Massif Central.
                             They consist primarily of Precambrian metamorphic
                             strata. Around these ancient nuclei extend thick eugeosynclinal
                             and miogeosynclinal zones. In areas of Variscan folding
                             there are large horizontal and sloping overthrust sheets
                             (the Ardennes and the Iberian Peninsula), as well as complex
                             dome-shaped (sometimes fan-shaped) folds.</p>
                            <p>Also part of the Hercynian zone consists of the folded
                             structures of the Urals and Novaia Zemlia, which adjoin
                             the European Platform from the east. The Paleozoic folded
                             strata of the Urals extend toward the west. In the east they
                             are penetrated by thick intrusions of ultrabasites and granitoids.
                             The Ural folded system consists of a number of parallel
                             anticlinal uplifts and synclinal downwarps. The structure
                             of the eastern parts of this mountain area are eugeosynclinal,
                             whereas the western regions are miogeosynclinal.</p>
                            <p>As a rule, foredeeps extend along the boundaries of the
                             ancient platforms (for example, the <q>"coal channel"</q> between
                             France and Belgium and the Cisural downwarp). They are
                             filled with coal-bearing, petroleum-bearing, and saliferous
                             molasse. The Eastern European Platform is bounded on the
                             east by the Paleozoic folded region of the Urals.</p>
                            <p>The mountain structures in southern Europe (the Andalusian
                             Mountains, the Apennines, the Alps, the Carpathians,
                             and the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula and the Crimea)
                             belong to the Alpine geosynclinal (folded) region. The northern
                             part of the Alpine geosynclinal downwarps was formed
                             on the Paleozoic folded structures of Western and Southern
                             Europe. In these zones were formed primarily schistose,
                             flysch, and thick carbonaceous series, which make up the
                             Alps and Carpathians. Very little magmatism occurred in the
                             region. A thick cover and foredeeps originated during the
                             Alpine tectonic period. The southern part of the Alpine folded
                             region arose on the site of the Epibaikal Platform, which had
                             disintegrated as a result of alpine movements. During the
                             Paleozoic the Epibaikal Platform encircled the Precambrian
                             African-Arabian Platform from the north in the form of an
                             extended mobile shelf. In this region many stable, ancient
                             blocks have been preserved - intermediate massifs and
                             traces of extensive alpine magmatism (in the form of ultrabasites).</p>
                            <p>Within the Alpine folded system unique depressions originated,
                             characterized by an earth-crust structure that resembles
                             the ocean's (for example, part of the depression of the
                             southern Caspian, the Black Sea, and the Tyrrhenian Sea).
                             According to data from geophysical investigations the
                             <q>"granitic"</q> stratum in these areas is either sharply reduced or
                             absent, and the earth's crust is generally 20-30 km thick.</p>
                            <p>The mineral resources of Europe include petroleum and
                             natural gas deposits, which are confined to the platform's
                             Paleozoic and Mesozoic deposits (the Volga-Ural petroleum

                            <p>Thick deposits of iron ores are being mined in the USSR
                             in the Urals, the Ukraine, and Voronezh and Kursk oblasts
                             and on Kola Peninsula. In Western Europe the iron deposits
                             of Sweden are very important, as well as the Jurassic sedimentary
                             oolitic ores of the Lorraine basin in France and
                             Luxemburg. A major deposit of manganese ore is located in
                             the Ukrainian SSR (Nikopol' Raion). Bauxite deposits have
                             been found in the Urals as well as in other regions of the
                             Eastern European Platform and in Hungary, France, Yugoslavia,
                             Italy, and Greece. Nonferrous metals such as copper,
                             nickel, cobalt, lead, and silver are distributed primarily in the
                             Hercynian zone in the GDR, the FRG, Spain, Yugoslavia,
                             and Bulgaria and in the Upper Silesian Basin in Poland. Deposits
                             of rock salt and potash salts are widespread in the
                             Devonian and Permian sediments of the Ukraine, Byelorussia,
                             the Caspian region, and the foothills of the Urals. Rich
                             deposits of apatite-nepheline ores are mined on the Kola
                             Peninsula. Major saliferous deposits dating from the Permian
                             and Triassic ages are confined to the territories of Denmark,
                             the FRG, the GDR, and Poland. Also of great importance are

                             The geography of Europe determines the predominance
                             in it of a temperate climate, but the westward movement
                             of air from the Atlantic over the continent results
                             in the prevalence of a marine climate, as well as climates
                             that are transitional between marine and continental. The
                             average annual magnitudes of the radiation balance are positive
                             everywhere and increase from north to south. On the
                             arctic islands they are approximately 10, near the 50th parallel,
                             approximately 40, and in the southern regions of Europe,
                             up to 250-290 kilojoules per cm2 (kJ/cm2) (60-70 kilocalories
                             per cm2 [kcal/cm2]). In January the entire continent, with
                             the exception of the Mediterranean Sea and most of France,
                             has a radiation balance that varies from -17 to -4.2 kJ/cm2
                             (between - 4 and - 1 kcal/cm2). In July the variations between
                             the northern and southern regions is practically eliminated,
                             because the days become longer in the north in
                             summer. The radiation balance in most of Europe in July is
                             about 34 kJ/cm2 (8 kcal/cm2).</p>
                            <p>The displacement of air masses in the system of atmospheric
                             circulation causes the redistribution of heat,
                             especially during the winter. The thawing effect of the westward
                             shift of air, which is intensified by the warm North
                             Atlantic Drift, is manifested in the divergence of the winter
                             isotherms from the latitudinal direction and in the significant
                             amount by which average winter temperatures in most of
                             Europe (except the southeast) exceed average latitudinal
                             temperatures. (Examples include the positive anomaly of
                             January temperatures on Novaia Zemlia, the Kola Peninsula,
                             Svalbard, and the British Isles, which is 8°-18°C , and that
                             of temperatures in western Scandinavia and Iceland, which
                             is 18°-24°C.)</p>
                            <p>Radiation and circulation, which affect the formation of the
                             European climate, undergo sharp seasonal changes. During
                             the winter the lowest atmospheric pressure occurs over the
                             North Atlantic, where the Icelandic depression is located.
                             From there the pressure increases toward the east and southeast
                             up to the Caspian region and the Southern Urals, to
                             which a branch of the Asian anticyclone extends. The westward
                             shift in the air mass is extremely intense over the western
                             part of the Mediterranean Sea, which is located within
                             the zone affected by the Azores anticyclone. In this system,
                             cyclones that originate on the atmospheric fronts move from
                             west to east, swerving toward the higher latitudes. Polar air
                             masses prevail over almost all of Europe, and bursts of arctic
                             air masses may reach the Alps, the Balkan Peninsula, and the
                             Crimea. In the Mediterranean region polar air is sometimes
                             replaced by tropical air.</p>
                            <p>The winter isotherms generally pass from northwest to
                             southeast. The highest average monthly temperatures in
                             January (10°-12°C) are encountered in the Mediterranean region,
                             as well as in the maritime regions of Europe, where the
                             0°C isotherm extends to 70° N lat. The lowest average monthly
                             temperatures occur in the northeastern regions of Europe,
                             reaching -24°C in Franz Josef Land and -20°C in the
                             Pechora basin, where the minimum absolute temperature in
                             Europe has been recorded (-52°C). In general, Western
                             Europe has mild winters, whereas Eastern Europe has freezing
                             winters with a constant snow cover and a duration ranging
                             from one month in the south to seven to nine months in
                             the north.</p>
                            <p>During the summer the pressure gradients decrease. In
                             July the pressure remains low near Iceland as well as over
                             most of Eastern Europe. The highest pressure occurs in the
                             region of the Azores anticyclone, which affects the entire
                             Mediterranean region and parts of Central Europe. Cyclonic
                             activity is less intense in summer than in winter. Tropical air
                             prevails in the Mediterranean region, arctic air over the arctic
                             regions, and polar air over the remaining regions. The sea air
                             that comes from the Atlantic has a lower temperature than
                             the continental air. Thus, maritime areas are generally
                             somewhat cooler in the summer than areas located inland at
                             the same latitudes. Although the July isotherms run approximately
                             in a latitudinal direction, as they approach the Atlantic
                             Ocean they bend toward the south, and in the east, they
                             bend to the north. The average July temperature is highest
                             along the Mediterranean (28°-30°C) and in the Caspian region
                             (24°-26°C). The lowest average July temperatures have been
                             recorded on the arctic islands (2°-4°C). A maximum absolute
                             temperature of 48°C was recorded on the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
                            <p>In general, the total annual atmospheric precipitation decreases
                             from west to east. The Atlantic regions and the
                             windward slopes of the mountains receive 1,000-2,000 mm of
                             precipitation per year. (Individual stations located in the
                             maritime regions of Yugoslavia have recorded a total annual
                             precipitation of more than 4.000 mm.) In Eastern Europe
                             particularly in the southeastern and southern regions, the
                             total annual precipitation decreases to 300-500 mm per year
                             and in the Caspian region it is usually 200 mm or less. Most of
                             the arctic islands and the southern shore of the Barents Sea
                             receive 300-400 mm of precipitation per year. Data on total
                             annual precipitation in the Mediterranean region and on the
                             southern coast of the Crimea clearly show that maximum precipitation
                             occurs in the winter and minimum precipitation in
                             the summer. The Atlantic regions of Central and Northern
                             Europe have a rather even seasonal distribution of precipitation;
                             nonetheless, the maximum figure is likely to occur in the
                             winter. Inland the maximum precipitation figures occur during
                             the summer.</p>
                            <p>Throughout most of Europe the total annual precipitation
                             exceeds the total annual evaporation. Hence, there is
                             sufficient or even excessive moisture. In the southern and
                             southeastern regions of Eastern Europe as well as in a
                             number of intermontane depressions in Western Europe, the
                             annual precipitation does not compensate for the annual
                             evaporation, resulting in insufficient moisture. In the
                             Mediterranean area there is an acute deficiency of moisture
                             during the summer. Where precipitation does not compensate
                             for evaporation, irrigation is necessary.</p>
                            <p>Europe encompasses the arctic, subarctic, temperate, and
                             subtropical climate belts. In the arctic belt, which includes
                             the islands in the European part of the Arctic Ocean, the
                             climate is severe, with a long, freezing winter, frequent
                             storms and blizzards, and a brief, cold summer (as a rule, the
                             average July temperature, does not rise above 5°C). The chief
                             form of precipitation is snow, and there is little evaporation.
                             In the subarctic belt (Iceland, northern Fennoscandia, and
                             the East European Plain), the summer is longer and warmer
                             than in the arctic belt (up to 10° or 12°C in July). The winter is
                             mild in the western regions and freezing in the east. The total
                             annual precipitation is 1,000 mm in the west and 400 mm in
                             the east, and evaporation is less than precipitation.</p>
                            <p>The temperate belt (the remaining regions of Europe, with
                             the exception of the Mediterranean region and the southern<pb n="149" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0149"/>
                             shore of the Crimea) has a cold, boreal climate in the north
                             and a warmer, subboreal climate in the south. Moreover, the
                             western portion of the temperate belt has a marine climate,
                             with a narrow annual temperature range, warm summers in
                             the south and cool summers in the north, and on the plains,
                             mild winters with intermittent snow cover. There is abundant
                             precipitation throughout the year, particularly during the
                             winter, and there is sufficient or even excessive moisture. In
                             the east the climate is moderate continental, with a freezing,
                             snowy winter (except in the southern regions), cool summers
                             in the north, warm summers in the center, hot summers in the
                             south, and a wide annual temperature range. The total annual
                             precipitation exceeds the total annual evaporation in the
                             north, is almost equal to it in the center, and is less than it in
                             the south.</p>

                             Europe is second to South America in
                             magnitude of water flow (approximately 295 mm). However,
                             because of its relatively small land mass, it surpasses only
                             Australia and Antarctica in volume of flow (approximately
                             2,850 cu km per year). The flow is unevenly distributed over
                             the territory of Europe. With respect to the degree of moisture,
                             it decreases from west to east and from north to south.
                             Most of Europe belongs to the basin of the Atlantic Ocean
                             and its seas, but smaller parts of the continent are included in
                             the Arctic basin and the inland Caspian basin.</p>
                            <p>The major rivers are concentrated on the plains of Eastern
                             Europe. The Volga (with its principal tributaries, the Kama
                             and Oka) is first in length (3,530 km), basin area (1,36 million
                             sq km), and average annual discharge (more than 8,000 cu m
                             per sec). After the Volga, the longest rivers in Eastern
                             Europe are the Ural, Dnieper, Don, Pechora, Dnestr, and
                             Severnaia Dvina, and in Western Europe, the Danube
                             (length, 2,850 km; basin area, 817,000 sq km), Rhine, Elbe,
                             Vistula, Loire, Tajo, and Oder.</p>
                            <p>On the plains of Eastern Europe slow-moving rivers with
                             broad, terraced valleys prevail. They are fed by snow and
                             partly by rain, and their principal flow occurs during the
                             spring and early summer. Because the snow melts later on
                             the northern part of the plain, the maximum flow occurs there
                             in the summer. During the winter the ice cover lasts from 1 1/2
                             to three months in the south and as long as seven to 7 1/2
                             months in the north. The construction of large reservoirs on
                             such rivers as the Volga, Dnieper, and Don has made their
                             flow cycles more even and increased their importance for
                             transportation.</p>
                            <p>In Fennoscandia most of the rivers are short, with rapids
                             and poorly developed valleys that have many broad stretches
                             resembling lakes. On the plains the rivers are fed primarily by
                             snow. The maximum flow occurs during the spring, but as a
                             result of the regulating role of the lakes and the large forests
                             in the basins, the water content is also great in the summer
                             and autumn. In the mountainous regions of Fennoscandia<pb n="150" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0150"/>
                             there are waterfalls. The ice cover lasts from two to three
                             months in the central regions and as long as seven to 7 1/2
                             months in the north.</p>
                            <p>In the plains regions of Central Europe the rivers are fed
                             basically by rain. The rivers either do not freeze over or have
                             brief, intermittent ice covers. In France, the British Isles,
                             Belgium, the Netherlands, and the FRG the rivers have an
                             even flow that increases somewhat during the winter and
                             decreases during the summer. By contrast, on the eastern
                             plains of Central Europe the rivers are fed by snow as well as
                             by rain in the spring so that the maximum flow shifts to the
                             spring, and the summer low-water period is longer and lower
                             than elsewhere in Central Europe. In medium-height mountains
                             such as the Carpathians, which are covered by snow in
                             the winter, there are spring freshets. The rivers of the high-mountain
                             regions of the Alps (the upper courses of the Rhine
                             and the Rhone, the left tributaries of the Po, and the right
                             tributaries of the Danube) are fed by glaciers as well as by
                             snow and rain. High-water periods are characteristic of the
                             summer months, whereas the flow is very small or disappears
                             during the winter. Typical of the Mediterranean rivers are
                             considerable increases in the water level during the autumn
                             and winter, and in some places, during the winter and
                             spring. Low water occurs during the summer, when small
                             rivers become extremely shallow or dry up completely. The
                             winter discharge of some rivers exceeds the summer discharge
                             by tens of times. The more regular flow of rivers in
                             karst regions of the Mediterranean is explained by the considerable
                             role of groundwater in feeding them. Entire sections
                             of some Mediterranean rivers flow underground.</p>
                            <p>Lakes are very unevenly distributed over the territory of
                             Europe. The largest groups are found on the plains and in
                             mountains that underwent Pleistocene glaciation (the Northern
                             and Northwestern European USSR, Fennoscandia, the
                             British Isles, the Alps and Alpine regions, and the plains of
                             Poland and the GDR). Most of the lakes in these regions are
                             related to tectonic subsidences, such as hollows and grabens,
                             which were eroded by glaciers and partly surrounded by glacial
                             deposits. Characteristic of these lakes are heavily indented
                             shorelines, considerable depth, and glacial topographic
                             forms that extend along the longitudinal axis of the tectonic
                             movements or in the direction of the movement of the
                             glaciers. Lakes of this type include plains lakes (Ladoga,
                             Onega, Vänern, Vattern, Mälaren, and Imandra) and piedmont
                             lakes (for example, Geneva, Maggiore, Como, and
                             Garda). Widely distributed on morainic plains are relatively
                             small lakes of intermorainic subsidences or lakes formed in
                             ancient troughs by the flow of preglacial waters. (The latter
                             type is found especially on the plains of the Soviet Baltic
                             region, Poland, the GDR, and Finland.) The Alps, the mountains
                             of Scandinavia and the British Isles, the higher Carpathians,
                             and the Northern Urals have small tarns in cirques.</p>
                            <p>Outside of the glacial regions there are no significant
                             groups of lakes. Among the most common types are old lakes
                             on the floodplains of rivers located in the plains regions, delta
                             lakes in the lower reaches of the Volga, Dnieper, Danube,
                             and Po, lagoon lakes along the shore of the Black Sea and the
                             Sea of Azov, and tectonic lakes, such as Scutari and Ohrid on
                             the Balkan Peninsula and Balaton in Hungary. Also typical
                             are volcanic lakes on the Italian Peninsula and in Iceland, and
                             sink lakes in the eastern part of the Eastern European Plain
                             and on the Balkan and Italian peninsulas.</p>
                            <p>Most of the lakes in Europe are freshwater bodies that
                             have a continuous outflow. In the arid southeastern regions
                             there are drainless, saline, heavily mineralized lakes, such as
                             El'ton and Baskunchak. On the border of Asia is located the
                             world's largest lake - the Caspian Sea.</p>
                            <p>Europe has considerable hydroelectric power resources,
                             particularly in the mountainous regions of Scandinavia, the
                             Alps, and the medium mountains of Central Europe. Highcapacity
                             hydroelectric power plants have been built on the
                             large rivers of Eastern Europe in the USSR (the Volga,
                             Kama, and Dnieper). In 1972 construction was proceeding on
                             a major hydroelectric power plant on the Danube (Djerdap - the
                             Iron Gate). Economically important for transportation
                             and for floating timber are rivers and the system of canals
                             connecting the basins of many rivers in Eastern and Western
                             Europe and joining the rivers to the seas (for example, the
                             White Sea-Baltic Canal, the Lenin Volga-Don Shipping Canal,
                             and the Lenin Volga-Baltic Water Route in the USSR, the
                             Göta canal system in Sweden, the Mittelland Kanal and
                             other canals in the GDR and the FRG, and the Canal du
                             Midi in France). The Volga, Dnieper, Danube, Vistula,
                             Rhine, Thames, Seine, and Oder are among the rivers that
                             have been transformed into major transportation arteries
                             with heavy traffic in freight and passengers. Lakes play a
                             great role in water supply, and their shores are often developed
                             as areas for rest, recreation, and medical treatment.
                             There are deposits of mineral salts in Lakes El'ton and Bas-kunchak.</p>

                             The total area of present-day glaciers in Europe
                             exceeds 116,000 sq km. Most of the glaciers are concentrated
                             in Svalbard (58,000 km), Novaia Zemlia, Franz Josef Land
                             Iceland, and the Scandinavian mountains, where dome and
                             shield glaciers prevail. There are also corrie and piedmont
                             glaciers. The ice is often 400-600 m thick, and in some cases
                             up to 1,000 m thick. Some glaciers in the arctic islands descend
                             to the sea, where they give rise to icebergs. In the
                             continental part of Europe glaciers are found in the Alps, the
                             Northern Urals, the Pyrenees, and the mountains of the
                             Sierra Nevada (the site of Europe's southernmost glacier),

                             In general, soils are zonally distributed in Europe.
                             There are four belts of soil formation: arctic (polar), boreal
                             subboreal, and subtropical. The soils of the boreal and subboreal
                             belts occupy the greatest area. In structure of soil
                             zones and types of soils, a distinction may be drawn between
                             Western Europe, with its moist oceanic climate, and Eastern
                             Europe, with its continental climate.</p>
                            <p>Arctic and tundra soils are found in the arctic belt. Arctic
                             soils - extremely shallow soils with poorly differentiated
                             genetic soil horizons - are found on Svalbard, Franz Josef
                             Land, and northern Novaia Zemlia. Tundra soils are widespread
                             in northern Fennoscandia and southern Novaia Zemlia
                             and on the Eastern European Plain north of the arctic circle.
                             They are usually oversaturated with moisture, poorly aerated,
                             and primarily acidic, with a shallow humus horizon that serves
                             as the transition to a dove-colored gley horizon. Organic remains
                             decompose very slowly in tundra soils. In submerged
                             poorly drained places (especially in the basin of the lower
                             course of the Pechora River), tundra soils are mixed with
                             tundra swamp soils.</p>
                            <p>The boreal belt encompasses Iceland, most of Fennoscandia,
                             the British Isles, the Northern European Plain, and Eastern
                             Europe north of the L'vov-Kiev-Kursk-Perm'-Sverdlovsk
                             line. In regions of this belt that have a continental climate, a
                             number of soil types alternate sequentially with each other.
                             The first type in the sequence is gley-podzolic soil of the
                             northern taiga. Because of the excessively moist surface and
                             the formation of podzol, this type of soil is characterized by
                             gleying and by the slow decomposition of organic remains.
                             The typical podzolic soils of the central taiga have a clearly
                             manifested leaching cycle, which removes a considerable
                             portion of the products of decay from the upper layers of soil.
                             The soddy-podzolic soils of the southern taiga are associated
                             with mixed broad-leaved-coniferous forests in which podzol
                             is formed and an accumulation of humus has developed. In
                             the extreme southern part of the boreal belt in Eastern
                             Europe gray forest soils are widespread under broad-leaved
                             forests. They support an active peat-forming process and
                             have a readily identifiable humus horizon and a signifiCant
                             humus content (3-8 percent).</p>
                            <p>In regions of the boreal belt that have a maritime climate
                             the soil types include peaty-soddy soils, which are found
                             under the subarctic meadows and sparse forests of Iceland
                             northwestern Scandinavia, and the Faeroes and Hebrides
                             and are characterized by a high content of coarse humus.
                             Highly leached, soddy pale podzols occur in southern Scandinavia
                             and Finland, northern Great Britain, and the Central
                             European Plain, alternating in places with acid neopodzolic
                             forest soils, which are formed on richer parent rocks.
                             Among the intrazonal soils that are characteristic of the
                             boreal belt are alluvial soils (including the marshy soils on flat
                             shorelines, peaty-carbonate soils (rendzinas), which develop<pb n="151" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0151"/>
                             only on parent rocks rich in carbonate, and peaty-gley soils,
                             which develop on gently rolling meadow plains of the
                             taiga, where the groundwater is shallow, and peaty bog
                             soils found on sands with poor drainage and clay deposits
                             close to the surface. Mountain-tundra soils have developed
                             in the mountainous regions of the boreal belt. In the Urals
                             there are also mountain, soddy-podzol, and mountain
                             gray forest soils, and there are mountain podzolic soils in
                             Scotland and the medium-elevation mountains of Scandinavia.</p>
                            <p>In the subboreal belt the variations in the zonal structure of
                             the soil covers of the marine and moderate continental climatic
                             regions are even greater. In the moderate continental
                             steppe regions chernozems and chestnut soils have formed
                             on parent loess rocks. In the forest steppe and northern steppe
                             regions there are podzolized, leached, and typical chernozems,
                             which are characterized by a thick black humus horizon,
                             a high humus content (8 percent or more), and a
                             carbonate illuvial horizon. The drier steppe regions have
                             light- and medium-humus common and southern chernozems,
                             with a humus content of 4-8 percent and a dense
                             carbonate horizon. On marls and limestones in Moldavia and
                             the adjacent regions of Rumania, in the Eastern Azov Lowland,
                             and on the plains of the Crimea there are common and
                             southern micellary carbonate light- and medium-humus soils,
                             with a high carbonate content throughout their profile. In the
                             more arid steppes of the Southern Ukraine, the Lower Volga
                             Region, and the Caspian region, a nonleaching cycle has
                             given rise to chestnut soils with a shallow humus horizon and
                             a very dense carbonate horizon. In the Caspian region chestnut
                             soils are frequently mixed with solonets, the formation
                             of which is usually associated with the salinity of the parent
                             rocks. In the most arid parts of the Caspian region, where
                             there is semisteppe vegetation, brown semidesert soils
                             alternate with considerable accumulations of sands.</p>
                            <p>In regions that have a marine climate, brown forest soils
                             have developed under broad-leaved trees. They have a
                             poorly differentiated cross section and a thick brown illuvial
                             horizon associated with the intensive formation of clayey
                             materials and leaching of carbonates. As a result of the considerable
                             dissection of their surface and their lithologically
                             mixed quality, brown forest soils are leached and podzolized
                             to varying degrees. They frequently alternate with podzolic
                             bog soils and brown rendzinas. In the intermontane plains,
                             with their more continental climate, brown forest soils are replaced
                             by primarily shallow, typical and common chernozems
                             and meadow chernozems, whose basic zones extend to the
                             Danubian Plain. In the depressions on the intermontane plains
                             solonchak and solonets are found. On most of the mediumelevation
                             mountains mountain brown forest soils have developed.
                             In the Carpathians, Pyrenees, and Alps mountain podzols
                             are found at elevations of 1,000-1,600 m, alternating at
                             higher altitudes with mountain-meadow soils.</p>
                            <p>In the subtropical soil formation belt of Southern Europe
                             and the southern coast of the Crimea, cinnamonic soils are
                             typical under evergreen xerophytic forests and bushes. They
                             have a considerable humus content (4-7 percent) and a high
                             carbonate content throughout their profile. In moist regions
                             leaching has caused the carbonates in cinnamonic soils to
                             filter down to great depths. In the western Balkan Peninsula,
                             the southeastern Italian Peninsula, and other regions where
                             terra rossa (the product of wind-eroded carbonate rocks) has
                             become widespread, highly carbonate red rendzinas have
                             formed. In the most arid regions of the Mediterranean
                             grayish cinnamonic soils are associated with underbrush.
                             From the products of wind-eroded basic crystalline rocks in
                             the Balkan Peninsula, very dense, light-humus smolnitz soils
                             have developed, which are blackened by undissolved organic
                             substances. The mountains of the Mediterranean have mountain
                             cinnamonic soils that alternate with high-mountain
                             brown forest soils.</p>
                            <p>The soils of Europe are used extensively in agriculture.
                             The most arable regions are those with chernozems, brown
                             and gray forest soils, or cinnamonic soils. Tundra and brown
                             semidesert soils are very seldom used in agriculture, and
                             arctic soils are not used at all.</p>

                             In terms of its floral composition, Europe belongs to
                             the Holarctic region. Because of the ancient and contemporary
                             links between various continents, a large number of
                             European floral families, genera, and species are the same as
                             those of Asia, Africa, and North America, and there is a
                             relatively small number of endemic varieties. The botanical-geographic
                             subdivisions of Europe are characterized not only
                             by a specific floral composition but also by specific types of
                             vegetation. Among the types of vegetation found in Europe
                             are tundra, boreal (taiga), and forest, including broad-leaved
                             and mixed forests as well as the underbrush and grasses associated
                             with them. Additional types of vegetation are
                             steppe, desert, and subtropical brushwood. The forest types
                             of vegetation are the most widespread, whereas the least
                             common are the tundra and desert types. In the arctic, subarctic,
                             and boreal latitudes there are only slight differences
                             between the zonal types of vegetation in regions with a
                             marine climate and regions with a continental climate. In
                             lower latitudes the differences in zonal vegetation are clearly
                             manifested. In maritime regions south of the taiga forests,
                             mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forests are found; as
                             well as a wide band of broad-leaved forests, which are replaced
                             by xerophilous evergreen and mixed evergreen-deciduous
                             forests and shrubs in subtropical regions. In the
                             moderate continental regions south of the taiga, there are
                             narrow bands of broad-leaved and mixed coniferous and
                             broad-leaved forests, which give way to forest steppes,
                             steppes, semideserts, and deserts as one moves south and
                             southeast. (On the southern shore of the Crimea there is
                             some subtropical vegetation.)</p>
                            <p>On the territory of present-day Europe natural landscapes
                             are almost entirely lacking: They have been replaced by
                             manmade ones. Tundra and mountain landscapes and fauna
                             have undergone the least change. At one time the forests of
                             Europe formed an almost uninterrupted zone, consisting
                             primarily of oaks and other broad-leaved species, which have
                             been replaced in the north by conifers and in the south by
                             sparse Mediterranean forests. The destruction of the forests
                             began in Greece as long ago as the fifth century B.C. Later,
                             the forests of other regions of Southern and Central Europe
                             were badly damaged. The systematic elimination of the forest
                             cover, which violated the integrity of the natural biotopes,
                             was accompanied by a number of other pernicious consequences
                             for the fauna and flora of Europe.</p>
                            <p>Arctic tundras and deserts are widespread in Svalbard
                             (Spitsbergen), Franz Josef Land, and Novaia Zemlia. Vegetation
                             includes lichens and mosses, a few species of grasses
                             (for example, saxifrage and geranium), and shrubs (for example,
                             <hi rend="italic">Dryas</hi> and polar willow). Considerable areas - the
                             arctic deserts - are composed of rocky surfaces devoid of
                             vegetation. Typical tundras, which developed along the
                             northern continental shore and on the coasts of Novaia
                             Zemlia, have a greater number of species and a more complete
                             plant cover. On mossy-lichen tundras, the predominant
                             vegetation is brown and green mosses, reindeer moss and
                             other lichens, several grasses (whitlow grass, fescue, galagoes,
                             and saxifrage), shrubs (crowberry and Korean rhododendron),
                             and low shrubs (dwarf birch and polar and roundleaved
                             willow). Bogs (primarily low ones) are found in the
                             excessively moist depressions on the surface of typical
                             tundras. In the mountains of Iceland, Scandinavia, and the
                             Urals mountain tundras are widespread, forming a vegetation
                             belt at elevations of more than 300-500 m in the north
                             and 1,000-1,100 m in the south. The tundra gives way to
                             forest tundra in the south, which is characterized by a
                             combination of tundras, swamps, and low sparse forests,
                             consisting primarily of spruce in the eastern regions and
                             birches and pines in the western areas. Mossy-lichens and
                             shrubs are well developed in these forests (cowberry,
                             whortleberry, bearberry, and crowberry). In the mountains,
                             similar forests form a vegetation belt at elevations of 300-400
                             m in the north and 900-1,000 m in the south. Sparse birch
                             forests mixed with meadows and lowland swamps are found
                             in Iceland. Tundra vegetation is used in some places to
                             feed deer.</p>
                            <p>Taiga vegetation grows in a broad band that extends south
                             to approximately 57°-58° N lat. Most of the forests are coniferous.
                             In the East, Siberian spruce, Siberian fir, and Siberian<pb n="152" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0152"/>
                             larch prevail. (The Siberian stone pine is found in the Cisurals
                             as well as in the northern regions of the taiga as far as Scandinavia.)
                             European spruce and common pine prevail in the
                             western taiga. In moist regions the ground cover of the forests
                             consists primarily of moss, whortleberry, cowberry, heather,
                             and oxalis, but in dry areas lichens prevail. In addition to
                             conifers, birch and aspen are commonly encountered, most
                             often in places that have been burned or cut down. On the
                             northern boundaries of the taiga forests in Fennoscandia
                             there are indigenous birch forests. Other types of vegetation
                             that are widely distributed in the taiga zone are floodplain
                             and dry valley meadows, surface spaghnum bogs with rhododendron,
                             cloudberry, cranberry, and whortleberry, and
                             grassy forest swamps. In the Scandinavian mountains and
                             the Urals the lower belt of mountain vegetation consists of
                             taiga forests.</p>
                            <p>The taiga has extremely abundant plant resources. Its
                             forests provide wood that is used in the cellulose-paper,
                             chemical, and construction industries. Fur-trapping is carried
                             on in the taiga forests (squirrels, martens, ermines, fox, and
                             blue hare). A number of wild animals, including elk, hazel
                             hens, black grouse, and capercaillie, are hunted for meat.
                             Mushrooms are gathered, as well as the fruits of wild plants
                             such as cowberry, whortleberry, currant, mountain ash, and
                             bird cherry. The meadows are used primarily to feed cattle.</p>
                            <p>The mixed broad-leaved and coniferous forests located
                             south of the taiga stretch from southern Scandinavia to the
                             Urals, reaching their greatest breadth in the Soviet Baltic
                             region, Byelorussia, and the west central regions of the
                             European USSR. East of the city of Gorky the forest belt
                             becomes extremely narrow. The forests consist of taiga as
                             well as broad-leaved species of trees (oak, maple, and linden).
                             Huge pine forests have developed on sandy soils.</p>
                            <p>A significantly large area is occupied by broad-leaved
                             forests that cover the entire territory of Western Europe
                             (except the mountains) from the taiga and mixed forests in
                             the north to the subtropics in the south (approximately 40° N
                             lat.). East of the Carpathians the broad-leaved forest belt
                             becomes extremely narrow and almost disappears in the foothills
                             of the Urals, where the southern boundary of the mountains
                             passes through 53°-54° N lat. The most common tree in
                             these forests is the oak. In marine climatic regions pedunculate
                             and sessile oaks (as far east as the Southern Bug River)
                             and other species of oak occur in pure groves or in plantings
                             mixed with birch (the British Isles, Belgium, and the Netherlands),
                             common hornbeam, linden, and European beech
                             (chiefly in Western Europe). Pure beech forests are confined
                             to the slopes of hills and the lower zone of mountains, where
                             the winters are relatively warm, the humidity is high, and the
                             soil is not overly saturated with moisture.</p>
                            <p>Planted forests of sweet (edible) chestnuts are characteristic
                             of southern regions, particularly France. Evergreen
                             species (holly, boxwood, and a typical liana-ivy) are found
                             in the undergrowth of the broad-leaved forests of Atlantic
                             regions. On the poor, sandy, and gravelly soils of the northwestern
                             part of France, the British Isles, and the Northern
                             European Plain, moors and grassy or grassy-mossy swamps
                             prevail, and on the shores of the North Sea there are saltmarshes.
                             On the intermontane plains (Bohemia and the Central
                             Danubian Plain) there are many "islands" of meadow-land
                             steppes in the forests.</p>
                            <p>The moderate continental regions of Eastern Europe have
                             no chestnut or beech forests, with the exception of the
                             eastern beeches in the Crimea. In addition to the pedunculate
                             oak, common genera include linden, maple, ash, elm, and in
                             the underbrush, filbert, spindle trees, and honeysuckle. In
                             the mountains the vegetation of the lower zone consists of
                             mountain broad-leaved and coniferous forests, which extend
                             to elevations of 1,600-2,100 m. At higher altitudes there is a
                             belt of subalpine shrubs and meadows, which in the highest
                             mountains is replaced by an alpine meadow belt.</p>
                            <p>In most areas the forests have been cut down in order to
                             increase the amount of arable lands and to expand gardens,
                             orchards, and vineyards in the southern regions. In reforestation
                             projects broad-leaved trees (especially beech) are often
                             replaced by coniferous trees (pine or spruce) or rapidly growing
                             deciduous varieties (poplar). The meadows of the subalpine
                             and alpine belts are extensively used as summer pastures.</p>
                            <p>Located south of the broad-leaved forests in the moderate
                             continental regions of Europe are the forest steppes, in which
                             broad-leaved forests, most of which are on watersheds, are
                             mixed with meadowland steppes overgrown with many
                             moisture-loving varieties of grass (cinquefoil, spiraea,
                             groundsel, anemone, sage, and adonis). Farther south,
                             typical steppes have developed, where soddy grasses prevail
                             (Ukrainian, narrow-blade, and Lessing's feather grasses and
                             sheep's fescue). Located south of the typical steppes in the
                             most habitable areas in the southern Ukraine, the northern
                             Crimea, and the Lower Volga Region are the arid (southern)
                             steppes, with a sparse cover of wormwoods, feather grass,
                             capillary feather grass, sheep's fescue, and wheat grass. In
                             the extreme southeastern part of Europe semidesert and
                             desert areas have very sparse vegetation of wormwoods and
                             saltworts (seablite and <hi rend="italic">biiurgun</hi>).</p>
                            <p>Steppe vegetation has been almost completely destroyed
                             by the plowing up of chernozem and chestnut soils for such
                             crops as wheat, corn, sugar beets, and sunflowers. It survives
                             almost exclusively in preserves. Vegetation of the
                             semidesert and desert areas is used for pastures, primarily
                             for sheep.</p>
                            <p>Widely distributed on the plains and in the lower belt of
                             the mountains of the subtropical regions of Europe are xerophilous
                             evergreen forests and shrubs that are capable of
                             surviving the dry summer period. The most important trees
                             are holm, Kermes, and cork oaks, as well as Aleppo, cluster,
                             and Italian stone pines. The forests are light, with an abundant
                             undergrowth of shrubs and a grass cover that is almost
                             completely burned out during the summer. Among the most
                             common shrub formations are maquis, composed of strawberry
                             trees, <hi rend="italic">Phillyrea</hi>, myrtle, rock-rose, pistachio, sweet
                             bay, and wild olive and palmettos. (The only wild palm found
                             in Europe is the fan palm, which grows in the southern
                             Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, and Sicily.) Other
                             shrub formations include the garigue, in which the scrub
                             Kermes oak prevails (primarily on rocky soils), and <hi rend="italic">tomillars</hi>,
                             sparse growths of plants rich in essential oils (thyme and
                             lavender), which are found in the dry interior regions of the
                             Iberian Peninsula. Shibliaks are composed primarily of
                             deciduous shrubs such as Christ's thorn and wild lilac, with
                             some evergreen plants. In the interior and eastern regions of
                             the Balkan Peninsula there are phrygans made up of low
                             thistles and stiff grasses.</p>
                            <p>In the mountain regions of the Mediterranean above the
                             belt of evergreen forests and shrubs (beginning at 300-400 m
                             in the north and 800-1,000 m in the south) there is a belt of
                             deciduous broad-leaved (oak, beech, and chestnut) and
                             coniferous forests (spruce, fir, pine, Atlantic cedar). Above
                             this belt in the highest mountains there is a narrow belt of
                             subalpine and alpine vegetation. Most of the forests and
                             underbrush of the Mediterranean region have been removed
                             by man or destroyed by the fires that frequently occur there.
                             They have been replaced by fields of wheat and corn, citrus
                             fruit plantations, olive trees, cork oaks, vineyards, orchards,
                             gardens, and parks. Located in the southeastern part of the
                             Iberian Peninsula are the only fig-palm plantations in Europe.
                             The pasturing of goats and sheep has caused considerable
                             changes in mountain vegetation.</p>

                             Europe is part of the Holarctic zoogeographic region.
                             The distribution of groups of animals greatly depends
                             on the displacement of basic types of vegetation. Thus,
                             European fauna is characterized by geographic zonality.
                             However, the zonality of the fauna is less extreme than that
                             of the flora, inasmuch as the same groups of animals may be
                             confined to different but ecologically similar types of vegetative
                             cover. Because changes in European biotopes proceeded
                             relatively slowly, many species of animals gradually
                             adapted to the new man-made conditions of existence and
                             found refuge in regions that had been only slightly developed.</p>
                            <p>A monotonous habitat with scanty food supplies and
                             severe climate, the tundra has few species of fauna. Small
                             rodents prevail in Norway, Ob, and arctic lemmings and Mid-<pb n="153" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0153"/>
                             dendorf mice. Also characteristic of the tundra are the
                             northern deer, arctic fox, wolf, and seal (the common ringed
                             seal and the sea hare). Among the species of birds the most
                             abundant are the alpine ptarmigan and the white owl. Gulls,
                             cormorants, geese, puffins, eiders, and black guillemots inhabit
                             the seashore, where thousands of nests may be found.
                             There are shore and island colonies of birds, the largest of
                             which inhabit Novaia Zemlia. On Svalbard musk oxen from
                             Greenland have been acclimatized.</p>
                            <p>With its great variety of habitats and considerable feeding
                             resources, the taiga has a richer faunal species composition.
                             Characteristic mammals include wood voles, Siberian chipmunks
                             (in the east), wood lemmings, and flying squirrels
                             (primarily in the east), squirrels, blue hares, sable, wolverines,
                             ermine, weasels, brown bears, wolves, foxes, and elk.
                             Among the taiga birds are the capercaillie, hazel hen, nutcracker,
                             tawny owl, great tit, crossbill, bullfinch, waxwing,
                             and hawk. There are numerous bloodsucking insects.</p>
                            <p>South of 60° N lat. in the west and 55° N lat. in the east
                             certain characteristic taiga animals disappear, giving way to
                             animals of the broad-leaved and mixed forests (especially in
                             Western Europe). Among the mammals common to this region
                             are the dormouse, mink, polecats, European wildcats,
                             red deer, roe deer, wild boar, bats, and hedgehogs. Taiga
                             animals in this region include the brown bear, fox, wolf,
                             forest marten, badger, elk, and squirrel. There are bison in
                             the forests of the Bialowieza Forest in the USSR and Poland,
                             as well as in the Prioksko-Terrasnyi and Khoper preserves
                             in the Carpathian region. The number of waterfowl has
                             declined. Inhabiting the broad-leaved forests are green and
                             middle spotted woodpeckers, woodcocks, cuckoos, jays,
                             chaffinches, nightingales, grouse, owls, pigeons, orioles,
                             thrushes, and great tits. In certain countries of Western
                             Europe the pheasant has become acclimatized and is widely
                             distributed.</p>
                            <p>In the broad-leaved and coniferous forests there are more
                             amphibians than on the taiga. (Among them is the tree frog,
                             the only arboreal amphibian.) The cutting down of forests
                             and the increase in open spaces has facilitated the penetration
                             of this zone by a number of steppe animals, including the
                             common hamster, common vole, great bustard, common partridge,
                             and quail. The number of forest animals has been
                             sharply reduced. Large mammals have suffered more than
                             other animals, for their ecological requirements have not met
                             the changes in biotopes. During the first half of the 17th century
                             the tur became extinct in Western Europe; lions, which
                             had been numerous in antiquity, ceased to roam the Balkan
                             Peninsula, and the habitats of wolves declined. The European
                             ibis became extinct during this period, and the number
                             of eagles fell sharply.</p>
                            <p>Characteristic of the fauna of the steppe and semidesert
                             regions of Eastern Europe is the prevalence of rodents (red
                             and little susliks, members of the family Leporidae, common
                             hamsters, marmots, great jerboas, moles, and voles). Other
                             common mammals are the European hare, Siberian polecat,
                             and fox. Water voles and otters are associated with bodies of
                             water. The semidesert areas of the Caspian region are inhabited
                             by the saiga, corsac fox, little suslik, and common sandeel.
                             Among the birds of the steppe and semidesert regions
                             the predatory group is important (pale harriers, kestrels, and
                             imperial eagles). Also common are the lark, quail, common
                             partridge and great and little bustards. In the lower reaches of
                             major rivers, particularly the Volga, there are many
                             pochards, ducks, heron, cormorants, and snipe. Although
                             the steppes have been plowed up, many animals, especially
                             rodents and birds, have been preserved. They find sufficient
                             food and shelter in the crop fields.</p>
                            <p>The Mediterranean region has a relatively low species saturation
                             of forest animals, but mountain forms of animals are
                             more abundant than in the northern regions. Also represented
                             are reptiles and amphibians. Among the mammals are the
                             wild goat, Alpine ibex, chamois, and mouflon. The Pyrenean
                             muskrat and the genet inhabit the western Mediterranean
                             region, and Gibraltar is inhabited by the only apes in
                             Europe - the Barbary apes, or tailless macaques (the family
                             Cercopithecidae). Porcupines and jackals are found in the
                             east. Among the common birds are the bearded vulture,
                             Pyrenean sparrow, rock sparrow, mountain jackdaw, Eastern
                             blue magpie, swifts, swallows, warblers, and wall creepers.
                             Reptiles of the region include lizards, geckos, scheltopusiks,
                             vipers, flying snakes, chickensnakes, and turtles.
                             Among the amphibians are frogs, toads, salamanders, newts,
                             and olms. The most abundant insects are cicadas, butterflies,
                             and mosquitoes.</p>

                            <p>The foundation for the discovery of the continent of
                             Europe was laid by the Cretans, who occupied the Cyclades
                             archipelago no later than the 16th century B.C. and traveled
                             along the shores of the island of Evvoia (Edboea) and the
                             Peloponnesian Peninsula. The Achaeans, who lived in the
                             Peloponnesus between the 15th and 13th centuries B.C., advanced
                             north on the Balkan Peninsula beyond 40° N lat.;
                             discovering the Pindus Mountains and Mount Olympus, the
                             Khalkidhiki Peninsula, the Northern Sporades, Lemnos, and
                             in the west, the Ionian Islands. By the ninth century B.C.,
                             Phoenician seafarers had discovered the southern and western
                             coasts of the Italian Peninsula, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia,
                             the Balearic Islands, and the shores of the Iberian Peninsula,
                             including the lower reaches of the Guadalquivir, Guadiana,
                             Tajo, and Duero rivers. The Phoenicians also sailed out into
                             the ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar.</p>
                            <p>By the middle of the first millennium B.C., the ancient
                             Greeks had completed the discovery of the coasts of Southern
                             Europe. From the Aegean Sea they sailed northeast
                             through the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara, and the Bosphorus,
                             traveling along the western and northern shores of
                             the Black Sea as well as up the lower reaches of the Danube,
                             Dnestr, and Dnieper rivers, along the shores of the Sea of
                             Azov, and up the lower reaches of the Don and the Kuban'.
                             Sailing west and northwest in the Ionian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian,
                             and Ligurian seas, as well as in the Gulf of Lions, they
                             definitively established the existence of the Balkan and Italian
                             peninsulas and discovered (perhaps for the second time)
                             the islands of Corsica and Liguria, the southern coast of
                             present-day France with the Rhone delta, and eastern Spain,
                             with the lower reaches of the Ebro and Turia rivers.</p>
                            <p>No later than 320 B.C., Pythias, a Greek from the colony
                             of Massalia (Marseilles), discovered the western coast of
                             Europe from the Bay of Biscay to the North Sea, as well as
                             the peninsulas of Brittany and Cotentin and the British Isles.
                             He cut into the Irish Sea from the south and sighted the northeastern
                             coast of Ireland, the Hebrides, and the Orkney
                             Islands. Then turning south, he sailed along the eastern
                             shore of Great Britain. No later than the fourth century B.C.,
                             the Greeks settled the northern plateaus of the Balkan Peninsula
                             and the Apennines, and they crossed the eastern Alps.
                             In the third century B.C., the Carthaginians penetrated deep
                             into the interior of the Iberian Peninsula, laying the foundation
                             for the discovery of the Meseta, central mountain region,
                             and Iberian mountains. In 218 B.C., at the time of Hannibal's
                             campaign, they crossed the Pyrenees and the western Alps.</p>
                            <p>During the second century B.C., as a result of the campaigns
                             of Cato the Elder and particularly Scipio Aemilianus,
                             whose constant companion was the Greek Polybius, the Romans
                             explored all the important rivers of the Iberian Peninsula
                             and investigated almost the entire length of the central
                             mountains, the Pyrenees, and the Cantabrian Mountains. Between
                             58 and 51 B.C. the legions of Julius Caesar, which were
                             subduing the Gauls and fighting against the Germans, cut
                             through the French Massif Central in various directions and
                             penetrated the Jura, the Vosges, the Ardennes, the Paris Basin,
                             and the western maritime lowlands. They explored the
                             entire course of the Rhone, Garonne, Dordogne, Loire, and
                             Seine rivers, and their major tributaries; they became familiar
                             with the entire left-bank section of the Rhine and with a
                             section of its right bank. Caesar's legions also penetrated into

                            <p>Between 35 B.C. and A.D. 9, Octavian Augustus' generals,
                             including Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Marcus Crassus,
                             Claudius Drusus, and Tiberius, invaded Central Europe.
                             They traveled up the Rhine and the Danube, exploring the<pb n="154" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0154"/>
                             valleys of the Danube's largest Alpine tributaries. (Tiberius
                             reached the sources of the Danube on the slopes of the Black
                             Forest in 16 B.C.) Octavian's generals also explored the Elbe
                             and its left tributaries, and they discovered the mountains
                             between the Rhine and the Elbe, as well as the basins of the
                             Weser and Ems rivers, the maritime lowland, and the Frisian
                             Islands. Between A.D. 43 and 84, the Romans, who were
                             engaged in the conquest of Britain, advanced west to the
                             Irish Sea and north to 57° N lat., discovering the peninsula of
                             Wales, the isles of Wight, Man, and Anglesey, the Severn
                             basin, the area around the Humber estuary, the Pennine
                             Mountains, and the highlands of northern Britain. (These
                             discoveries were made during the campaigns of A. Plautius,
                             S. Paulinus, and Julius Agricola.) While they were repulsing
                             the incursions of northern <q>"barbarians"</q> into Central Europe
                             during the first century, the Romans expanded their knowledge
                             about the left bank of the upper and middle Danube.
                             Amber merchants crossed Europe and reached the Baltic
                             Sea, gathering meager information about the maritime zone
                             between the Jutland Peninsula and the lower reaches of the
                             Vistula. During the conquest of Dacian territory on the left
                             bank of the lower Danube at the beginning of the second
                             century, the emperor Trajan discovered the Transylvanian
                             plateau and the portion of the Carpathians surrounding it.</p>
                            <p>Between the sixth and seventh centuries the Irish basically
                             completed the exploration of the British Isles, and in the
                             eighth century they were the first to reach the Faeroe Islands
                             and Iceland, which were rediscovered and colonized by the
                             Norsemen during the ninth century. Furthermore, the Irish
                             were the first to sail around the Scandinavian and Kola
                             peninsulas from the north, and they penetrated into the
                             White Sea (Ohthere's voyage in the 870's). They sailed
                             around Scandinavia from the south and east, exploring the
                             coasts of the Baltic Sea and the gulfs of Bothnia, Riga, and
                             Finland. All the important islands in the Baltic Sea as well as
                             the lower reaches of the Neman and the Zapadnaia Dvina
                             were discovered by the Irish. During the eighth and ninth
                             centuries the Arabs explored the entire southern part of
                             Europe, especially the Iberian Peninsula, which they conquered
                             in 711-18. In the southeast and east, they explored
                             Emba and Iaik (Ural), as well as the Volga Region as far as
                             the mouth of the Kama River.</p>
                            <p>All the remaining regions of Eastern Europe and all of
                             Northern Europe from the White Sea and the Baltic gulfs to
                             the Urals were discovered by Russians. From the ninth
                             through the 12th century, chiefly as a result of Novgorodian
                             expeditions and campaigns by the princes Oleg, Sviatoslav
                             Igorevich, Vladimir Sviatoslavich, Iaroslav the Wise, and
                             Vladimir Monomakh, the Russians completed the exploration
                             of the Dnestr, Dnieper; and Don basins. They discovered
                             the entire course of the Zapadnaia Dvina and Neman
                             rivers, Lakes Il'men', Chudskoe, Pskov, Ladoga, Onega, and
                             Beloe, and the river systems of the upper and middle Volga
                             (including the Oka and the Kama), the Severnaia Dvina, Mezen',
                             and Pechora, and they reached the Severnyi Ural
                             River. No later than the 13th century the Russians had circled
                             all the shores of the White Sea and penetrated into the
                             interior regions of the Kola Peninsula. During the 14th century
                             they crossed the Urals. In the 15th and 16th centuries
                             Russian seafarers sailed along all the coasts of Northern
                             Europe, discovering the Kanin Peninsula, the islands of Kolguev,
                             Vaigach, and Novaia Zemlia, and in the northwest,
                             Svalbard, to which they made annual hunting and fishing expeditions
                             as early as the mid-16th century. During the second
                             half of the 16th century Muscovite surveyors explored and
                             mapped the rivers of Eastern Europe, a number of large lakes,
                             the northern Pomor'e and the Kola and Kanin Peninsulas, and
                             Kolguev and Vaigach islands. The <bibl>

                            <p>The coasts of all the southern European seas and part of
                             the Atlantic shoreline were explored in detail and drawn on
                             nautical charts between the 13th and 15th centuries, mainly
                             by Italian sailors. At the end of the 16th and the beginning of
                             the 17th century the Dutch and English discovered a number
                             of geographical areas, some of which had been discovered
                             previously. Among them were Severnyi Island in the archipelago
                             of Novaia Zemlia, Bear Island, and Vestspitsbergen
                             (W. Barents, 1594-97). Edge Island, Northeast Land,
                             and other islands belonging to the Svalbard group (T. Edge,
                             1613-17), and Jan Mayen Island (J. May, 1614). Between
                             1603 and 1646, Swedish topographers led by A. Bure surveyed
                             the shores of the Scandinavian Peninsula, including
                              all its important protrusions, as well as Lakes Vânern,
                             Vattern, Malaren, and Inari, and many rivers, including
                             the largest ones (the Glama, Piteälven, and Iorneälven).
                             They also discovered a number of mountain ranges, and in
                             Finland they explored the Suomenselkä Ridge and part of the
                             Maanselka Ridge.</p>
                            <p>In Russia during the 18th century V. N. Tatishchev and
                             I. K. Kirilov explored the Central and Southern Urals
                             (1720-37), and P. I. Rychkov and I. Krasil'nikov explored
                             the Bugul'ma-Belebei Upland and the Obshchii Syrt (1741-55).
                             Between 1768 and 1782 the leaders and participants in
                             expeditions sponsored bv the Russian academy - P. S . Pallas,

                             (They were the first to note certain of its ranges and crests.)
                             In addition, they explored the Caspian Lowland and the
                             Kumo-Manych Depression, and in the Eastern European
                             Plain they mapped the Valdai Hills and discovered the Central

                             completed the description of the northern coasts of
                             Europe, thus establishing the exact outlines of the entire continent.

                             had been begun by the Italian naturalists A. Vallisnieri and
                             L. Marsigli between 1704 and 1719, was continued by
                             L. Spallanzani and the Frenchman D. Dolomieu between
                             1761 and 1784. French geologists, including J. Guettard,
                             N. Desmarest, and L. Ramond de Carbonnieres, explored the
                             Massif Central and the Pyrenees between 1751 and 1795, the
                             Swiss H. de Saussure explored the Jura and the western Alps
                             between 1758 and 1794, and Dolomieu and the Frenchman
                             B. Hasket, who was in the service of Austria, explored the

                             Outstanding explorers of the Carpathians were Hasket (1788-96)
                             and the Pole S. Staszic (1789-1805). Between 1753 and
                             1768 the hydrographer M. Mackenzie completed a precise

                             A. Viquesnet. During the 19th century geologists and geographers
                             discovered the uplands of Western and Central Europe
                             and definitively described the structure of the Alps (P. Dufrenoy,

                             including H. Sjeel and H. Frisak. Exploration of the terrain
                             of the interior regions of Iceland was begun by B. Gunnlaugsson
                             (1831-43) and completed by T. Thoroddsen (1881-98).

                             be land in the northern zone of the Barents Sea between
                             Svalbard and Novaia Zemlia. A glacial drift carried the Austrian
                             expedition ship of J. Payer and K. Weyprecht to the
                             northern Barents in 1873, where they discovered an island
                             that they named Franz Josef Land. Between 1880 and 1905
                             expeditions headed by L. Smith, F. Jackson, F. Nansen,
                             W. Wellman, and A. Fiala proved that Franz Josef Land is
                             an archipelago, and its component islands were put on the
                             map.</p>

                            <p>By mid-1970 the population of Europe (excluding the
                             USSR) was 462 million. According to data issued on Jan. 1,
                             1971, the population of the European USSR was 183.7 million
                             (excluding the Caucasus and Ciscaucasia, approximately
                             162 million).</p>

                             Almost the entire population
                             of Europe belongs to the large European race, which may be
                             divided into several smaller races. The Atlanto-Baltic race is
                             widely distributed on the territory of the Scandinavian countries,
                             Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, the Netherlands, the
                             northern part of the GDR, the Estonian SSR, and Latvian
                             SSR. The peoples of the central regions of Western Europe
                             and the European USSR belong primarily to variants of the
                             Central European race. The Balkano-Caucasian race is represented
                             in Yugoslavia, northern Greece, Bulgaria, southern
                             Austria, and northern Italy (the Tirol), as well as among the
                             peoples inhabiting the regions north, west, and east of the
                             Black Sea. Members of the Indo-Mediterranean race live in
                             Spain, most of Italy, France, southern Greece, and the
                             Mediterranean islands. In the Lithuanian SSR and parts of
                             the Latvian SSR and throughout northern European USSR
                             the White Sea-Baltic race is widely distributed. Characteristics
                             of the Uralic race are manifested in the Lapps and, to
                             varying degrees, among the Komi, Mari, Mordvinians, and
                             Udmurts. Elements of the South Siberian race have penetrated
                             the Volga Basin, and some authorities believe that a
                             Mongoloid amalgam is located in the Baltic region and Hungary.
                             In southern Italy an amalgam of the equatorial
                             (Negroid-Australoid) race has been noted.</p>

                             The overwhelming majority of the
                             present-day peoples of Europe speak Indo-European languages.
                             Eastern and southeastern Europe is populated
                             primarily by peoples of the Slavic group (about 215 million
                             inhabitants; all figures date from 1970), which is divided into
                             the subgroups East Slavic, West Slavic, and South Slavic.
                             The East Slavs include the Russians, as well as the Ukrainians
                             and Byelorussians, who are close to them in origin and
                             culture. The West Slavs include the Poles, Czechs, Slovaks,
                             and Lusatians, and the South Slavs consist of the Bulgarians,
                             Macedonians, Slovenes, Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, and
                             Bosnians. More than 4 million people (Lithuanians and Latvians)
                             speak the languages of the Letto-Lithuanian (Baltic)
                             group, which are similar to the Slavic languages.</p>
                            <p>Central and Northern Europe have been settled, for the
                             most part, by peoples belonging to the Germanic language
                             group (more than 180 million people), which has two subgroups.
                             The languages of the western subgroup are spoken
                             by the Germans, Austrians, German-Swiss, Luxemburgers,
                             people from Alsace-Lorraine, Dutch, Flemish, and Frisians,
                             as well as by the English-speaking peoples (English, Scottish,
                             Scotch-Irish and Anglo-Irish). The languages of the northern
                             subgroup are spoken by the Danes and the people of the
                             Faeroe Islands, Swedes, Norwegians, and Icelanders. The
                             Celtic language group includes the Bretons, Welsh, Gaels,
                             and Irish.</p>
                            <p>The 169 million people who speak Romance languages live
                             primarily in southwestern Europe. Among them are the Italians
                             and Italian-Swiss, as well as the French-speaking
                             peoples (French, French-Swiss, and Walloons) and the
                             Spanish, Catalonians, Portuguese, and Galicians, as well as
                             the Corsicans and the members of the Rhaetian Romance
                             group. A unique eastern Romance subgroup is formed by the
                             Rumanians, Aromanians (or Vlachs), and Moldavians.</p>
                            <p>Greeks and Albanians speak languages belonging to separate
                             groups of the Indo-European family. The language of the
                             gypsies, who have settled primarily in southeastern Europe,
                             belongs to the Indo-Aryan group. However, most of the gypsies
                             also use the languages of the regions where they live.
                             Jews live in almost all the countries of Europe. Their native
                             language - Yiddish - is close to German. (Certain Jewish
                             groups speak Judeo-Spanish, which is similar to Spanish.)
                             However, most Jews speak the languages of the countries
                             where they live.</p>
                            <p>A rather significant percentage of the population of
                             Europe, particularly in the northeast, consists of peoples
                             who speak languages of the Uralic family. About 9 million
                             people, including Finns, Estonians, K'arelians, and Saams
                             (Lapps), speak Finnic languages. Special subgroups of the
                             Finnic group (the Volga and Perm' regions) include the languages
                             of the Mordvinians, Mari, Udmurts, Komi, and
                             Komi-Permiaks. The Hungarians belong to the Ugric group
                             (12,8 million people). A number of peoples of the Volga and
                             Ural regions (the Chuvash, Tatars, and Bashkirs) speak
                             Turkic languages of the Altaic family, as do the Gagauz
                             (Gagaous) and groups of Turks in the Balkan Peninsula. The
                             Maltese speak a Semitic language that is similar to Arabic.
                             The language of the Basques (descendants of the ancient
                             population of the Iberian Peninsula) occupies a special place
                             in linguistic classification.</p>
                            <p>Characteristic of the peoples of Europe, especially in multinational
                             countries, are bilingualism and even trilingualism,
                             associated with the phenomenon of linguistic assimilation.
                             Thus, among the non-Russian peoples of the USSR, Russian
                             has become widespread. French is used by the national
                             minorities of France, and Spanish by the national minorities
                             of Spain. In a number of capitalist countries (for example,
                             Spain) the natural linguistic and ethnic assimilation of national
                             minorities has been made more complicated by the
                             assimilative government policies. The USSR and the other
                             socialist countries of Europe have created conditions for the
                             development of the language and culture of all their peoples.</p>
                            <p>The two principal branches of Christianity - the Orthodox
                             (Byzantine) and the Catholic (Roman) churches - have wide
                             followings in Europe. Also important are the various Protestant
                             churches and religious trends that broke away from
                             Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, primarily during the
                             Reformation (16th—17th centuries). Historically, Orthodoxy
                             became widespread chiefly among the peoples of Eastern and
                             Southeastern Europe (the Russians, the basic mass of the
                             Ukrainian and Byelorussian populations, and the Bulgarians,
                             Macedonians, Serbs, Montenegrins, Rumanians, Aromanians,
                             Moldavians, Greeks, and some of the Albanians and
                             gypsies, as well as the Karelians and Finnic-speaking peoples
                             of the Volga Region, the Chuvash, and the Gaguses). Roman
                             Catholicism spread among the Romance-speaking peoples of
                             Southwestern Europe (the Italians, French, and Spanish), a
                             number of Slavic peoples (the Poles, Czechs, Croats,
                             Slovaks, Slovenes, and some of the Ukrainians and
                             Byelorussians), and the Lithuanians and some of the Latvians.
                             In addition, Catholicism was adopted by certain Germanic
                             peoples (the Austrians, Luxemburgers, Flemish, and a
                             considerable number of Germans, as well as the Alsatians,
                             about half of the Dutch, and some of the English and Scots),
                             as well as by the Bretons, Irish, Hungarians, and Maltese.
                             Members of the Protestant churches and sects live primarily
                             in Central and Northern Europe (most Germans, some
                             Dutch, and the German-Swiss, English, Scots, Scotch-Irish,
                             Anglo-Irish, Swedes, Norwegians, Welsh, Finns, Estonians,
                             and some Latvians). Islam is professed by believers among<pb n="156" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol09.0156"/>

                             Bosnians, and by some Bulgarians. The religion of the Jews
                             is Judaism.</p>

                             has broken away from religion. The number of atheists is also
                             growing in the other socialist countries of Europe and in a
                             number of capitalist countries, especially the Protestant

                            <p>The present-day political map of Europe reflects the radical
                             sociopolitical changes that were brought about by the
                             victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia,
                             the defeat of the fascist powers in World War II (1939-45), in
                             which the Soviet Union played a decisive role, and the victory
                             of the people's democratic and socialist revolutions in
                             several countries of Eastern and Central Europe. As a result
                             two groups of countries have taken shape in Europe with
                             socioeconomic systems that differ in principle: the socialist
                             group, which, in addition to the Soviet Union, includes Bulgaria,
                             Czechoslovakia, the GDR, Hungary, Poland,
                             Rumania, Yugoslavia, and Albania: and the capitalist group,
                             which is made up of the remaining countries of Europe.</p>
                            <p>More than half of the territory of Europe - its eastern
                             part - is occupied by the USSR (the European USSR). Qn
                             the territory of Germany two states have been established
                             whose social systems differ in principle. Located in the eastern
                             part is the German Democratic Republic, which has developed
                             as a socialist state, and located in the western part is
                             the Federal Republic of Germany, a capitalist state.</p>

                    <p>Knowledge is the opposite of ignorance, the absence of
                        verified information about something. Elementary knowledge
                        resulting from biological regularities is characteristic of animals
                        as well, for whom it serves as a necessiry condition for
                        the vital activity of the organism and for the realization of its
                        behavioral activity. Knowledge may be everyday, prescientific,
                        artistic or scientific, scientific knowledge is subdivided
                        into empirical and theoretical. As a rule everyday knowledge
                        is limited to the statement and description offsets. Scientific
                        knowledge ascends to the level of explanation of facts and
                        their comprehension in a system of concepts of a given science,
                        it is included within a theory. The essence of scientific
                        knowledge consists in understanding reality in its past, present
                        and future in reliably generalizing from facts, in discovering
                        necessary and regular laws behind random occurrences
                        and geneial patterns behind singular events and on

                        constantly advancing from ignorance to knowledge from
                        superficial to increasingly more profound and comprehensive

                            <gloss target="#ART" rend="unmarked">, one of the forms of social consciousness, a component of the spiritual culture of mankind, a particular way of perceiving the world in both
            physical and spiritual terms. In this sense, various human activities are classified as art, including painting, music, the theater, and literature
            (which is sometimes classified separately, as in the expression "literature and art"). These artistic activities are all figurative reproductions of
            reality. In a broader sense, art refers to any useful activity that is performed skillfully not only in terms of technique but also in terms of
            aesthetic expression.</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Throughout history there has been strong disagreement concerning the definition of art and its role in human life. Art has been defined as the
            imitation of nature, the free creation of forms, the reproduction of reality, the self-knowledge of the Absolute, the artist's self-expression, and
            the language of feelings. Art has also been described as a special kind of game or prayer. These differences of opinion result from the dissimilar
            philosophical positions of theorists (materialistic or idealistic) and from differences in their ideological principles. The differences also occur
            because the theorists' views are influenced by the particular art medium (for example, literature or architecture) and style (for example,
            classicism or realism) with which they are concerned. A major factor giving rise to conflicting definitions of art and its role is the objective
            structural complexity of art itself.</p>
                        <p>Some theorists, who are not aware of the complex and many-sided nature of art's structure, define the essence of art as gnoseological, ideological,
                        aesthetic, or inventive. Dissatisfied with <pb n="7" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol10.0007"/>these and other one-sided definitions, some art scholars assert that art encompasses dissimilar yet
            organically related elements, such as the cognition and evaluation of reality, the reflection and creation of reality, or the reproduction and
            symbolic representation of reality. These two-sided interpretations also fail to fully describe the complicated structure of art.</p>
                        <p>Scholarship has turned to systemic analysis in its study of the nature of art, which makes it possible to approach the problem from several
            different angles. Through this method of analysis, scholars wish to reveal those qualities and functions of art that are necessary and sufficient
            for the description of its intrinsic structure and to show that the union of these qualities and functions results not in a simple sum or mechanical
            conglomerate but in an organic entity that generates specific artistic effects. Scholars also strive to reveal the structural capacity of art to
            become modified, forming different genres and various historical types (for example, creative techniques, styles, currents, and schools). Although
            Marxist aesthetics is still far from a final solution of these problems, some of their specific aspects may be explained with sufficient
            definitiveness.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the historical development of the division of labor, diverse branches of material and spiritual production, as well as various forms
            of human associations, have emerged from the originally integrated and syncretic activities of man. Unlike science, language, and other specialized
            forms of social activity called upon to satisfy various human needs, art proved necessary to mankind as a means of the integral social upbringing of
            an individual, assisting in his emotional and intellectual development. Art also serves to preserve an individual's contact with man's accumulated
            collective experiences and age-old wisdom, as well as with man's concrete social and historical interests, aspirations, and ideals.</p>
                        <p>In order to fulfill the role of a powerful instrument for the socialization of the individual, art must resemble real life by re-creating
            (modeling) reality in all its integrity and structural complexity. Art must duplicate the experience of man and serve as its imaginary continuation
            and supplement. Art thereby expands man's experiences, making it possible for him to live many illusory lives in worlds created by writers,
            musicians, and painters. Art is both similar to and different from real life (this is the most important aspect of its dialectical nature).
            Inventive and illusory, like the play of the imagination, art is a creation of human hands. As <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach">L. Feuerbach</name> has noted, man's awareness of art as a handiwork is the principal
            difference from his attitude toward religion. <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name> expressed
            full agreement with <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach">Feuerbach</name> on this issue <ref>{Poln. sobr.
              soch., 5th ed., vol. 29, pp. 53-54)</ref>. A work of art arouses profound emotions similar to those resulting from real experiences. At the same
            time, aesthetic enjoyment is invoked, stemming from the appreciation of a work of art as a model of life created by man. This contradictory nature
            can exist only if art is isomorphic to man's real experiences. In other words, art must not copy life but reproduce life's structure.</p>
                        <p>Man's activities, which are organically integral, are made up of four primary interacting components—labor, cognition, value orientation, and
            communication. Correspondingly, works of art, which are in their own way organically whole, imitate the structure of man's activities. Primarily a
            specific means of apprehending reality, art also serves as a figurative method for the evaluation of reality and the assertion of a definite system
            of values. Works of art are created on the basis of the reflection and apprehension of the real world. However, man's consciousness of reality, in

                        <p>A work of art is always both a spiritual image of reality and a material structure, constructed from sounds, forms, colors, or words. An artist's
            final product is determined by the inherent properties of the medium with which he is involved. The structure itself serves a double role. It gives
            an artistic concept a material embodiment outside of which it, like any other model, cannot exist. In addition, it is a special artistic and
            figurative system of symbols, or a specific artistic language (for example, the language of music, choreography, painting, architecture, or
            cinematography), called upon to instill the artistic message that it contains in man's consciousness.</p>
                        <p>Thus, art as a specific social phenomenon is a complex system of qualities with a structure characterized by a combination of cognitive,
            evaluative, creative (spiritual and material), and symbolically communicative elements (or subsystems). As a result, art serves as a means of
            communication among people and as a tool for enriching their knowledge of the world and of themselves. Art is a means of instilling in an individual
            a specific system of values and also provides great aesthetic enjoyment. Despite the fact that all these functions are but unified aspects of the
            single aim of artistic influence upon man, their relationships among themselves often vary greatly. Sometimes one function comes to the foreground
            and assumes primary significance.</p>
                        <p>The artistic and creative activity of man develops in many forms, which are known as types (<foreign xml:lang="ru">vidy</foreign>), aspects
              (<foreign xml:lang="ru">rody</foreign>), and genres (<foreign xml:lang="ru">zhanry</foreign>). The abundance and diversity of these forms may seem
            to be a chaotic conglomeration, but, in fact, they constitute an orderly and organized, that is, a historically self-organized, system. Theorists of
            aesthetics have established that depending upon the materials with which artistic works are constructed, three types of art objectively evolve. The
            spatial, or plastic, arts—painting, sculpture, graphic art, photography, architecture, and applied art and design—develop images in space. The
            temporal arts, including literature and music, construct images that unfold in time but not in real space. The spatial and temporal arts, such as
            dance and acting (including all the arts based on acting—for example, the theater, the cinema, television, variety shows, and the circus), contain
            images that have extent, duration, materiality, and dynamics.</p>
                        <p>Each of these three types of art may use various kinds of symbols. They use representational symbols, which presuppose a resemblance of images with
            sensually apprehended reality. Representational symbols appear in the so-called fine arts (painting, sculpture, and graphic art), in literature, and
            in the theater. Nonrepresentational symbols, which do not suggest visually any real objects, phenomena, or actions, are also employed. These
            symbols, as seen in architecture, applied art, music, and dance, appeal directly to the associative mechanisms of perception. The combination of
            representational and nonrepresentational images is typical of synthetic forms of art. Architecture or applied arts are often combined with the fine
            arts. Words and music combine to form song, and acting and dancing combine to form pantomime.</p>
                        <p>Each of the three types of art is directly characterized by the particular method and by the type of image-bearing symbols used. Within the
            framework of these methods there are variations, which are determined by distinctive properties of the materials used and the resulting
            characteristics of the artistic language. Thus, variations of verbal art are oration and written literature. Music consists of both vocal and
            instrumental music. The theatrical arts comprise dramatic, musical, and puppet theaters, as well as shadow plays, vaudeville, and the circus.
            Variations of dance include social, classical, acrobatic, and gymnastic dances, as well as dancing on ice.</p>
                        <p>Each type of art is broken down further into aspects and genres. The criteria of these divisions have been defined by scholars in various ways.
            However, it is evident that various aspects of literature are epic, lyrical, and dramatic literature. Aspects of the fine arts include easel
            painting, monumental painting, and miniature painting. The various genres of painting include portraiture, landscape painting, and still life
            painting. Among the aspects of the theatrical arts are tragedy, drama, comedy, and vaudeville.</p>
                        <p>Art, when viewed as a whole, is a historically evolved system of various concrete and artistic methods of apprehending the world. Each of these
                        methods shares common features with <pb n="8" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol10.0008"/>others. At the same time, each has individual and distinctive characteristics.</p>
                        <p>Art originated during the Stone Age. Primitive man's earliest forms of artistic activity included the creation of myths, songs, and dances, the
            depiction of animals on cave walls, and the ornamentation of tools, weapons, clothing, and the human body. These activities were of enormous
            importance. They contributed to the strengthening of human collective life, developing primitive man spiritually and helping him to understand his
            social nature and his differences from animals. In other words, man's artistic activities served as an important historical agent of his
            humanization.</p>
                        <p>At this early stage of development art was not an independent form of human activity. All intellectual production at this time was <cit>
                                <quote>"directly interwoven" with material production</quote>
                                <ref>(K. Marx and F. Engels, Soch., vol. 3, p 24)</ref>
                            </cit>, and the various spheres of spiritual culture had not vet become differentiated. Correspondingly, art was inseparable from practical
            activities, religion, games, and other forms of human associations. Each of these activities was of an applied character.</p>
                        <p> As culture developed, art gradually became a specific area of activity, it became <cit>
                                <quote>"artistic production as such"</quote>
                                <ref>(K. Marx, Soch. vol. 12, p. 736)</ref>
                            </cit>. Nevertheless, many branches of artistic activity remained subordinated to religion for a long time. Some, to this day, have preserved
            indissoluble ties to different types of utilitarian activity. Architecture, design, and decorative applied art essentially fulfill technical roles.
            Essays and newspapers perform journalistic and informational functions. Oratory, posters, advertising, and decorative design are artistic forms of
            agitation and propaganda. Arts such as gymnastics and figure skating are forms of athletics. In all these cases, art enables the practical activity
            of which it is an integral part to have an emotional and psychological influence upon an individual. Having acquired its own formal distinction as
            an autonomous sphere of human activity, art did not lose its social character as far as its content, function and laws of development are concerned. </p>
                        <p>Art will always appear in some system of culture. The historical development of art reflects the influence of a complicated combination of external
            impetuses, including the evolution of material production, the economic order of society and technology and the evolution of social consciousness in
            its ideological and subtle sociological and psychological manifestations. However, at the same time, the artistic development of man is relatively
            independent and its coordination with determining social factors is contradictory. As a result, the historical process of art is subordinated to the
            changes and struggles among various creative methods. Each of these methods expresses a particular aspect of the many-sided structure of art, giving
            prominence to one or another element. For example, realist methods sought, above all, an understanding of reality, whereas classicism considered the
            principal role of art to be the representation of an ideal world in which an established system of values is presented. No matter how closely the
            fundamental elements of art's structure are connected to a particular creative method, the method characterizes first and foremost the content of
            the work of art and the interpretation of reality as seen through the eyes of the artist, it also characterizes the means by which the content is
            given form, that is, the features of the style. The process of mankind's artistic development unfolds in two dimensions. One of its coordinates is
            the concept of method, the other is the concept of style.</p>
                        <p>Expressing the needs of society and social development, art invariably attracts the attention of all social forces which are interested in
            influencing people—the state, classes, parties, and religious organizations. As a result, art is drawn into the orbit of class struggle, expressing
            the desires of either the people or the exploiting classes and espousing either social progress or reaction. It often embodies the most profound
            paradoxes and conflicts of social development. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">F. Engels</name> illustrated
            this by referring to the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">J.

                            </cit>. Under the conditions of a developed bourgeois society, art is degraded to the level of merchandise, and creative work is subordinated to the
            laws of market relations. Art is divided into what is known as art for the elite and art for the masses, this division has a destructive effect on
            all concerned. The ideology of imperialism and the psychology of individualism pervert the nature of art in terms of both content and form. </p>
                        <p>Under these conditions, only struggle against the faulty social relations of the bourgeois world can help art to overcome the pernicious influence
            of capitalism. It was for this reason that critical realism became the major trend in the development of art in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was
            also for this reason that <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name> in 1905, reflecting upon the
            development of proletarian art in bourgeois society, formulated the principle of communist <foreign xml:lang="ru">partunost</foreign>
            (party-mindedness). This principle joined the free spiritual lies of the artist with the revolutionary struggle of the working class, thus
            liberating him from the economic, ideological, and psychological pressures of bourgeois society. </p>
                        <p>In socialist society, the role, character, and future of art are determined by the new social conditions of artistic development and by the
            spiritual needs of people on the path of communist construction. The October Revolution of 1917 freed the artist from the authority of
            commodity-money relationships. This assured him of the opportunity to create genuinely free work, addressed to all of the people. Through his work,
            an artist can strive to unify the people's feelings, thoughts, and will, as well as their spiritual and aesthetic upbringing. <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V. I. Lenin</name> foresaw that under these conditions great communist art will be created in a
            new form corresponding to its new content <ref>(O literature i iskusstve, 1969, p. 666)</ref>. The method of socialist realism, which evolved during
            the development of proletarian and later, socialist art in the USSR and many other countries, is the concrete way of the realization of the Leninist
            program for the construction of the artistic culture of a communist society. </p>

                        The history of society
                        is both a part and a continuation of the history of the earth and
                        of nature. The history of society began with the appearance of
                        man on earth, and it is therefore the history of people whose
                        historical creative work begins with the genesis of human society
                        and is the content of history. Organized into groups, people, in
                        satisfying their needs, create material and spiritual values, transform
                        nature, and overcome the contradictions within society, in
                        the process changing themselves and their social relationships.
                        People live in different conditions, occupy different positions in
                        the system of production and consumption, and have different
                        levels of consciousness. The history of society encompasses all
                        processes and events and all the concrete and diversified activities
                        and acts of individuals, of groups of people, and of humanity
                        as a whole.</p>
                        <p>From the fashioning of stone tools mankind gradually moved
                        to the production and use of more complex and sophisticated
                        implements of bronze, and later of iron. Man created mechanical
                        devices for locomotion, then machines, and finally the systems
                        of machines upon which present production is based. From submission
                        to - and worship of - the forces of nature, mankind has
                        progressed to the conscious transformation of nature and society,
                        to the extent that it has come to know the laws of the
                        development of nature and society. Simultaneously, and related
                        to the development of material production and social relationships,
                        there occurred the long and extremely complex process of
                        transition from primitive groups, through class societies, to the
                        association of people who have abolished the exploitation of man
                        by man and who are building communism.</p>
                        <p>The process of the historical development of mankind is objective.
                        The development of society is influenced by many factors
                        in their complex, dialectical interaction, including the level of
                        development of the forces of production, of the relations of
                        production and of the corresponding phenomena of the superstructure
                        (the state, law), the geographic environment, the density
                         and growth of population, the class struggle, and
                        communications among peoples. Of all the factors in the development
                        of society, the determining one, in the final analysis is
                        material production that is the creation of the means of subsistence
                        necessary for the very existence of people and their activity.</p>
                        <p>The mode of production includes the forces of production as
                        well as the relations of production into which people enter. The
                        mode of production of a society's material life conditions the
                        social, political, and spiritual system of that society and determines
                        the type of relations that predominate in it. The material
                        life of society - the objective aspect of the historical process; - is
                        primary, and social consciousness is secondary. The life of society
                        and its history are manifested in man's conscious activity,
                        which constitutes the subjective aspect of the historical process.
                        The social consciousness of a given society and the elements of
                        the superstructure characteristic of it reflect its social being,
                        above all its dominant economic basis. Each generation is born
                        and matures under a definite system of socioeconomic relations.
                        These relations, inherited by the succeeding generation, are the
                        initial factors that determine the character and conditions of the
                        generation's activity. For this reason society attempts only those
                        tasks that are realizable in practice.</p>
                        <p>After coming into being, however, social ideas and the corresponding
                        phenomena of the superstructure become relatively
                        independent of the material relations that have engendered
                        them. Social ideas and the phenomena of the superstructure, as
                        a result of people's activity along a course that has been set by
                        these ideas and phenomena actively influence the course of social
                        development. Various elements of the superstructure - including
                        the political forms of the class struggle, legal forms,
                        political, juridical, and philosophical theories and religious
                        views - continually influence the historical development of the
                        basis. In the history of society, the fundamental types of relations
                        of production are the primitive communal, the slaveowning, the
                        feudal, the capitalist, and the communist, each with its corresponding
                        types of socioeconomic formations. The internal
                        source of the development of society is the process of continually
                        arising contradictions between mankind and nature and within
                        society, which are continually being overcome. However, just as
                        the mode of production is the main factor in the conditions
                        determining the life of society, so the contradictions inherent in,
                        the mode of production and the process of overcoming these
                        contradictions are the determining sources of social development.</p>
                        <p>A change in the development of the material forces of production,
                        which come into contradiction with the existing relations
                        of production that is, a change in social reality, gives rise to new
                        ideas. This contradiction provokes a struggle within society between
                        the classes and groups that cling to old forms of ownership
                        and to the political institutions that support them and the classes
                        and groups that aim at establishing new forms of ownership and
                        new political institutions, which, by resolving the conflict that
                        has arisen, ensure the progress of the forces of production. In
                        antagonistic formations, the lack of correspondence between the
                        material forces of production of the society and the existing
                        relations of production is manifested in class struggle. Changes
                        in the forms of ownership and in political institutions always
                        affect class interests and the contradictions within a society,
                        which can be resolved only through class struggle. The highest
                        manifestation of this struggle is social revolution.</p>
                        <p>The main creators of history are the popular masses, who play
                        a decisive role in the economic, political, and spiritual development
                        of human society. Historical expenence testifies to a continual
                        growth in the role of the popular masses in history. This
                        role becomes most active during the socialist revolution and
                        during the building of socialism and communism. The socialist
                        revolution radically changes the course of world history and
                        marks the beginning of the transition to a new social era, to a
                        fundamentally new social system, that is a classless society. The
                        criteria of social progress - along with the degree of development
                        of the forces of production and the emancipation of the popular
                        masses from the fetters of inequality and oppression - are the
                        successes in the development of a culture common to all mankind
                        and in the development of ethics and morals. The discoveries
                        of the <q>"secrets"</q> of nature - the energy of fire, water, steam,
                        and electricity and atomic energy - are landmarks of historical
                        development in the gradual mastering of the forces of nature.

                        <p>The development of human society also has a spatial aspect.
                        From the centers of his original appearance, man gradually
                        spread over the earth, opening up new and ever more extensive
                        territories, a process that, to a certain extent, is continuing at the
                        present time.</p>
                        <p>The path traveled by mankind testifies to the general acceleration
                        of the rates of development of society. Although the primitive
                        communal system existed for hundreds of thousands of
                        years, society has been moving at accelerating rates in the succeeding
                        stages of its development. Among different peoples and
                        countries the historical process of mankind's development is
                        neither even nor identical. There are moments in history of
                        relative stagnation and even of temporary regression, as well as
                        moments of particularly intensive development. Historical development
                        may occur unevenly during a particular epoch or in
                        a single country. Some spheres of economic, political, or spiritual
                        life may flourish and experience an upsurge while others decline
                        or stagnate. There are also differences among peoples and countries
                        at the same stage of historical development. For example,
                        the slavery of the classical world differs from Oriental slavery,
                        and feudal and capitalist formations, as well as the construction
                        of socialism in different countries, have their specific features.
                        However, the general tendency of historical development is one
                        of change in socioeconomic formations, although after the appearance
                        of the first antagonistic formation in world history,
                        several formations have coexisted at any given moment. Thus,
                        at the present time, along with the two basic formations of
                        socialism and capitalism, a feudal structure has been preserved
                        in a number of African and Asian nations. Contemporary society
                        has entered a new era of development - the era of the classless
                        communist society, in which all major differences in the levels
                        of development of the world's peoples will be gradually overcome
                        and in which the unity of the historical process will truly
                        become worldwide.</p>

                        In the course of its
                        development, historical science, like other sciences, absorbed the
                        experience of many generations of mankind. Its content and
                        subject matter were expanded and enriched, and an ever increasing
                        accumulation of knowledge occurred. World history became
                        the repository of the thousands of years of humanity's experience
                        in all spheres of material and spiritual life.</p>
                        <p>All the social sciences are historical in their method of cognition
                        of social phenomena and processes. The totality of the social
                        sciences, which from different viewpoints study various aspects
                        of the history of society (including history, philosophy, sociology,
                        political economy, jurisprudence, philology, aesthetics,
                        and linguistics), is generally called, in contrast to the natural and
                        exact sciences, the system of social sciences. Being separate and
                        relatively autonomous, the social sciences are organically interrelated.
                        Only in their totality are they capable of solving, in
                        dialectical unity, their main task - that of acquiring knowledge
                        about the past and contemporary condition of society in order
                        to ascertain the society's laws and to understand its present and
                        the trends of its development. Each of the social sciences offers
                        a part of the solution of the main problem facing history in the
                        broad sense. The formulation of the general laws of the development
                        of human society and of the moving forces of this development
                        constitutes the subject of historical materialism.</p>
                        <p>In a narrower sense the science of history is an essential part
                        of the social sciences, among which the place of history is conditioned
                         by its subject and by its method of research. For a long
                        time history bore a markedly descriptive character. Only later
                        did the science of history attempt to reveal the elements, interconnections,
                        and structure of human society and of the mechanism
                        of the historical process. Socioeconomic history developed
                        in the 19th century, under the influence of Marxism becoming
                        the history of socioeconomic processes and relations. The concrete
                         and varied life of society, in all its manifestations and in its
                        historical continuity from the origin of human society to its
                        contemporary condition, became the subject of historical
                        science.</p>
                        <p>The chief subject of the science of history is the study of the
                        concrete history of society on the basis of facts about the past and
                        present that are obtained from historical sources. The collection
                        of facts and their organization and analysis in relation to one
                        another is the internal basis of the science of history. In this
                        manner history, even at the primary stage of its development,
                        gradually created a factographic picture of the development of
                        society. With the accumulation of facts, history began to take
                        note of the interconnections and interdependence of individual
                        phenomena and of the typical nature of some of them. It was able
                        to amass the knowledge about the development of society that
                        was to become one of the prerequisites for the development of
                        historical materialism.</p>
                        <p>The Marxist conception of the history of society requires the
                        careful accumulation and study of facts. In this process, as <cit>

                        The
                        gathering of facts about various events, phenomena, and processes
                        is one aspect of history as a science. Therefore, narrative
                        and description occupy an important place in history. However,
                        as a science, history cannot merely retell events without striving
                        to understand and explain them. On the basis of an analysis of
                        the totality of facts history grasps the essence of individual
                        phenomena and processes in the life of society and discovers not
                        only the specific laws of its development but also the characteristics
                        of the historical development of individual countries and
                        peoples, in comparison with other countries and peoples. History
                        expresses all such discoveries in the form of theoretical generalizations.
                        With Marx' and Engels' discovery of the fundamental
                        laws of the historical development of society, history became a
                        true science. The second aspect of history as a science is theoretical
                        generalization and a recognition of the totality of amassed
                        facts and partial conclusions, studied in relation to one another.</p>
                        <p>The unity of these two aspects of historical science is indestructible.
                        The disruption of this unity inevitably leads in some
                        measure to distortion of the process of understanding the history
                        of society. The most extreme varieties of such distortion among
                        inconsistent materialists include vulgar sociologism, by which
                        the researcher deviates from or ignores concrete facts in order
                        to create arbitrary sociological schemata and empiricism, by
                        which a scholar takes as his goal the collection of facts without
                        attempting to interpret them or to discover definite laws. Some
                        inconsistent materialists were supporters of vulgar materialism,
                        elevating to an absolute the laws of natural science in a simplified,
                        metaphysical-mechanistic form. Thus, vulgar materialists
                        explained class differences as the result of heredity and
                        ascribed colonial slavery to the natural living conditions, such as
                        diet, of colonial peoples. Idealist historians most often regard
                        history from the standpoint of voluntarism, proclaiming will to
                        be the highest principle of being and opposing the principle of
                        will to the objective laws of social development. Human will and
                        individual behavior, mainly that of outstanding historical personalities
                        such as princes, kings, or military leaders, are held by
                        these historians to be the determining factors in the historical
                        process.</p>
                        <p>The methodological unsoundness of the idealists as well as of
                        the inconsistent materialists led either to a nihilistic rejection of
                        all past historical experience of mankind or to a eulogy of the
                        past affirming that mankind can expect nothing new and that
                        history itself is but a repetition of the past.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the development of the science of history the
                        change in the conception of the subject and tasks of history was
                        accompanied by a corresponding change in the method of understanding
                        and interpreting historical phenomena. The scientific
                        method of understanding the history of society was worked out
                        gradually in all the social sciences. Until the middle of the 19th
                        century historians employed methods that to a significant degree
                        were metaphysical in nature, therefore, their conclusions could
                        not be strictly scientific. Historians one-sidedly evaluated the
                        place of particular factors in society, such as natural conditions,
                        outstanding individuals, and social ideas. The absence of a genuinely
                        scientific method caused the slow progress of the study of
                        history.</p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol10.0100"/>
                        <p>Only the unification of dialectics with materialism - the appearance
                         of Marxism - made possible the creation of a truly
                        scientific method of understanding the complex and diverse history
                        of society, which became one of the reasons for the rapid
                        progress of the science of history that developed especially fruitfully
                        in the USSR and other socialist countries.</p>
                        <p>In any social science historicism is a necessary condition for
                        studying the facts and processes of social life. Historians of the
                        ancient East and of the classical world, interpreting this principle
                        in an oversimplified manner, attempted to give a description of
                        historical events in chronological sequence. Later, the striving
                        for historicism was expressed in attempts to reveal tendencies in
                        the historical process. Only with the appearance of Marxism did
                        historicism become the scientific method of understanding the
                        laws of the historical process for the social sciences, including
                        history.</p>
                        <p>Ignoring the principle of historicism leads to a distortion of
                        historical reality, such as viewing the past in modern terms.

                         of the historical development of society hamper the development

                        ideology of the most advanced class in the history of mankind,
                        the working class - having transformed history into a science,
                        became the basis of the rapid progress of the study of history.
                        The interests of the working class require objective historical
                        knowledge, since it helps the workers to comprehend the world-historical
                        task placed before them by the history of society's
                        development - that of bringing about the transition to communism
                         - and assists the workers in their struggle to accomplish
                        this task. Hence, the communist party-mindedness of history
                        and its scientific objectivity are identical.</p>
                        <p>In history, as in all other sciences, specialization has inevitably
                        occurred in the process of studying the history of society and
                        continues at the present time. History has become a sphere of
                        knowledge consisting of various sections and branches of
                        science, as well as of auxiliary and specialized historical disciplines
                        and sciences. The degree of specialization of the individual
                        parts vanes, permitting several groups to be distinguished.</p>
                        <p>The first group consists of individual sections and branches of
                        the science of history, within which historians study the history
                        of society as a whole (world history) and in parts. History is
                        studied according to formations and periods, by geographic regions,
                        or with respect to comprehensive themes or specific as
                        pects and phenomena in the history of mankind. Thus, world
                        history is subdivided into the history of primitive society, ancient
                        history, the history of the Middle Ages, modern history, and
                        contemporary history. Fields of study according to region in
                        elude the history of large historically interconnected areas (such
                        as the history of Europe and other continents and of particular
                        regions, such as the Near East or Middle Asia) and the history
                        of individual countries and peoples, such as the history of
                        France the USSR and the Ukraine. An understanding of general
                         and particular phenomena that groups of countries and
                        peoples have experienced such as the Renaissance and Reformation
                        requires research on comprehensive histoncal themes. In
                        the study of individual aspects of the history of mankind, separate
                        branches of the science of history came to be distinguished,
                        such as economic hisiory, political history, military history, the
                        history of foreign relations and the history of the workers' movement.
                         This division of history into different sections and branches
                         is conventional. Certain related sciences closely approach,
                        several branches of the science of history, and it is sometimes
                        difficult to give a precise demarcation between them.</p>
                        <p>The second group consists of auxiliary and specialized historical
                        disciplines including the study of sources, archaeography,
                        paleography, diplomatics, chronology, historical metrology,
                        sphragistics, genealogy, heraldry, and numismatics. The development
                        of these auxiliary fields into scientific historical disciplines
                         was necessitated by the need to work out a methodology
                        of historical research. With this aim the auxiliary historical disciplines
                        investigate the nature of sources and the degree to which
                        they reflect the objective process of the development of society.
                        These disciplines establish types of sources, as well as their number
                        and state of preservation, and develop the methodology of
                        research for various types of sources.</p>
                        <p>Two specialized historical sciences - archaeology and ethnology -
                        occupy an independent position and are organic parts
                        of history.</p>
                        <p>A number of related sciences, owing to the development of
                        other sciences, have become separate disciplines. These include
                        the history of a natural science and its branches (such as the
                        history of physics and chemistry), the history of technology, the
                        history of the state and law, the history of economic conceptions,
                        and the history of the art of war. Historiography studies the
                        history of the science of history itself.</p>
                        <p>History, as a science, fulfills an important social function. The
                        value of history lies in its achievements in understanding the
                        laws of the historical process, since only the expenence of world
                        history as a whole permits the separation of the general from the
                        particular and of the necessary from the accidental. In general,
                        formulation of the laws of development of society is possible only
                        on the basis of the achievements of history. Therefore, the
                        science of history, along with the other social sciences, plays an
                        important role as the scientific basis for directing social life.
                        Marxist historical science directly influences the communist education
                        of the people. It creates documentary accounts of outstanding
                        events of the past, of revolutionary battles of the
                        oppressed against the oppressors and of individual revolutionaries,
                        thinkers, and other heroes of history. The Marxist science of
                        history fosters hatred for exploitation and exploiters and a feeling
                        of socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism.</p>
                        <p>Contemporary reactionary historiography plays quite another
                        role, attempting to interpret historical material so as to inculcate
                        ideas of anticommunism and of racial and national exclusiveness
                        and to incite hatred among peoples.</p>
                        <p>In the USSR and other socialist countries Marxist-Leninist
                        historiography has become firmly established and is developing
                        rapidly. Through its knowledge of the laws of the development
                        of society in the past and present, Marxist-Leninist historiography
                         enables one to understand the inevitability as well as the
                        path of mankind's transition to a higher stage of social development,
                        communism.</p>
                        <p>Various specialized scientific institutions are engaged in historical
                         scholarship. These include historical scientific-research
                        institutes, such as the Institute of the History of the USSR, of the
                        Academy of Sciences of the USSR and the Institute of World
                        History of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Other institutions
                         working in the field of history include universities, museums
                        (including historical museums), archives, and historical
                        societies, which exist in most countries. Along with the preparation
                        of scholarly monographs collaborative scholarly works,
                        and educational literature, an important part of these institutions'
                        work is the publication of historical sources and journals.
                        In the USSR the leading general historical journal 
                        is <foreign xml:lang="ru">

                         from the principle that our knowledge originates in

                         the general principles and laws of the emergence of ideas

                        ideology in the same sense. In Napoleonic France the term
                        ideology acquired a nuance of scorn. People who approached
                        social life from the standpoint of abstract principles and understood
                         nothing of the practical questions of real politics began to

                        classes and consequently the objective motive forces of their own

                         of the construction of a desirable but imaginary reality

                        Thus reality appears in ideology in a distorted upside down
                        form and ideology turns out to be illusory consciousness in
                        which social reality the objective contradictions and requirements
                         of social life appears in transmuted form. In contrast to
                        these ideological forms scientific consciousness remains on the
                        real ground of history (<bibl>

                        The methods of the scientific analysis and critique of
                        ideology arte provided by the materialist conception of history,
                        according to which consciousness is comprehended existence
                        and thus must be explained from the existence of people, their
                        real life processes. Ideology follows the general laws of social
                        consciousness it possesses not absolute but only relative in
                        dependence.</p>
                        <p>In the development of ideology a certain stock of concepts
                        and ideas - conceptual material - accumulates and each new
                        ideology while constituting in its content the reflection of new
                        social conditions in its form associates itself with the preceding
                        ideology. Thus there is continuity in the sphere of ideology and
                        ihe influence of new socioeconomic conditions consists in the
                        fact that they determine the direction and mode of change of the
                        existing conceptual material. At the same time if in ideology
                        men and their circumstances appear upside down as in a camera
                        obscura this phenomenon arises just as much from their
                        historical life process - as the inversion depiction of objects on
                        the retina does from their physical life process (<bibl>

                        Analysis of the real historical process shows that ideological
                        illusions are not simply accidental errors and that ideology
                        fulfills definite social functions producing tvpes of thinking and
                        behavior or even programs of social action corresponding to the
                        interests of one class or another.</p>
                        <p>K. Marx and F. Lngels did not apply the term ideology to
                        their own system of views but rather characterized Marxism as
                        the scientific theory of socialism organically linked with the
                        proletariat's class struggle for liberation. The spread of Marxism
                        and the rapid increase in its influence on the workers movement
                        led to a new interpretation ot the concept of ideology in Marxist
                        literature. V. I. Lenin expanded the concept of ideology introducing

                        there were scientific elements in the systems of ideology preceding
                         Marxism but that only Marxism is a scientific ideology in
                        the true sense. According to Lenin the combination in theory
                        of a higher rigorous scientific principle with the revolutionary
                        principle is a most significant future of Marxism (see <bibl>

                        scientific analysis of capitalism the discovery of its transient
                        nature and the cognition of the laws and motive forces of social
                        development. Lenin showed that in the form of Marxism social
                        science for the first time consciously set for itself the goal of
                        aiding the oppressed masses in their struggle that is striving to
                        express the interests and practical tasks of the class of oppressed

                        Marxism thereby appears in practice as a scientific ideology.</p>
                        <p>With the elaboration of the conception of scientific ideology,
                        the notion of ideology itself became fuller and more complete
                        and the methods of analyzing it on the basis of the combination
                        of the social and epistemologieal approaches were generalized as
                        well. Insofar as ideology is a spiritual phenomenon it must be
                        evaluated in epistemologieal categories such is scientific or unscientific
                        true or false, correct or illusory. However while the
                        purely epistemological approach to the analysis and evaluation
                        of ideological pheonomena is necessarv it is insufficient. The
                        opposition between scientific and unscientific ideology has social
                        significance for it expresses the opposition of class interests. In
                        class society ideology alwavs has a class character and thus is
                        characterized in such sociopolitical categories as revolutionary
                        or reactionary progressive, or conservative liberal or radical,
                        and internationalist or nationalist. The connection between these
                        two series of evaluations is revealed by the principle of

                         of social reality with ihe interests of class. It proceeds from
                        the premise that the progressive class strives to build its ideology
                        on the basis of a more complete use of objective knowledge (for
                        example the bourgeoisie during its ascending development). But
                        this thesis expresses only a general tendency which may change
                        greatly under the influence of concrete historical conditions,<pb n="121" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol10.0121"/>
                        particularly during the period of prebourgeois development. The
                        thesis proves wholly correct in application to the working class
                        whose subjective interests coincide with the objective requirements
                         of social development and attract this class precisely to the
                        scientific ideology to the comprehensive use of objective scientific
                         knowledge to resolve the social problems confronting it.
                        This circumstance is expressed in the coincidence of party class
                        and the scientific objective approach to reality within Marxism-Leninism.</p>
                        <p>Scientific socialist ideology opposes the reactionary ideology
                        of the bourgeoisie which tries to justify and substantiate the
                        need for the preservation and strengthening of capitalism. The
                        class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the
                        opposition of the social systems of capitalism and socialism are
                        reflected in the clash of these ideologies.</p>
                        <p>The recognition of the class nature of ideology does not mean
                        that the class as a whole creates its own ideology. As the theoretically
                         elaborated consciousness of a class ideology is created by
                        those representatives of the class (the ideologists) who as Marx
                        expressed it arrive theoretically at the same conclusions that the
                        class as a whole reaches in practice. It is not ideology that arises
                        spontaneously from the conditions of life of a class but rather
                        the social psychology of the given class which establishes a
                        particular basis for the spread and assimilation of the class's
                        ideology. Spreading through the society and adapting itself to the
                        level of mass consciousness ideology accordingly acts on that
                        consciousness and influences the social psychology. Analyzing
                        the mechanism of the formation and spread of scientifc ideology
                        Lenin demonstrated that it does not arise out of the spontaneous
                        growth of the workers movement but rather arises as the result
                        of the development of science culture and progressive social
                        thought.</p>
                        <p>The bearer of scientific ideology is the advanced and conscious
                        vanguard of the revolutionary working class - its political party.
                        The party introduces scientific ideology to the masses to the
                        workers movement Lenin's paramount conclusion was that it
                        is possible for the masses to master scientific ideology only on the
                        basis of their own political experience when they become convinced
                         in practice that the ideology in question expresses their
                        interests. The reactionary ideology of the ruling exploiting class
                        on the other hand is foisted upon the masses by the system of
                        relations and the political ideological apparatus of that class and
                        by the means of mass information. Naturally the economically
                        and politically dominant class holds in its hands the means of
                        spiritual production, too. For this reason the dominant ideology
                        is always the ideology of the ruling class. In exploitative society
                        revolutionary ideology wins influence in a fierce struggle against
                        the dominating ideas in the society in question. Under socialism
                        the dominant role is played by scientific Marxist-Leninist
                        ideology which stands out as one of the factors in rallying the
                        entire society around the working class and its party in the
                        interests of consolidating and further developing socialism.</p>
                        <p>Ideology appears in different forms of political legal ethical
                        religious aesthetic and philosopical views. Conclusions drawn
                        from the discoveries of the natural sciences that pertain to philosophical
                         world views are ideological in nature and so natural
                        science too is an arena of ideological struggle. In the social
                        sciences theories themselves fulfill ideological functions since
                        the way they are employed for the solution of social problems
                        depends on ideological aims and orientations.</p>
                        <p>In the struggle against scientific communism bourgeois
                        ideologists also make efforts to refute the Marxist Leninist understanding
                         of ideology. In the West the ideas of the German

                        Marxism on the social conditionality of any ideology Mannheim
                        gave a false interpretation of the Marxist critique of illusory
                        consciousness. He denied the cognitive value of all ideologies
                        regarding an ideology as an aggregate of ideas aimed at main
                        taming the existing order and supported by a particular social
                        group. Assertions of the irrationality and mythological nature of
                        every ideology and denials in principle of the very possibility of
                        a scientific ideology are employed extensively in bourgeois writings
                         in the struggle against progressive views and above all in
                         the struggle against Marxism Leninism.</p>

                            </bibl>) was an extension of this critique of ideology.
                        According to this conception the developed industrial countries
                        of the West today face problems requiring technical solutions
                        rather than ideology and thus the influence of ideology supposedly
                        is gradually reduced to nothing. Reality however refutes
                        this conception. After World War II there was a sharp
                        decline in the influence of fascist ideology in conjunction with
                        the military political rout of the fascist powers. However reactionary
                        imperialist circles strive to revive this ideology in the
                        form of various systems of neofascist views including racism
                        chauvinism, antihumamsm and militarism. Anticommunism -
                        the chief ideological political weapon of imperialism - is characteristic
                        both of conservative and liberal bourgeois ideology.
                        Diverse antiwar, anti-imperialist and national liberation movements
                        are accompanied by complex ideological processes in
                        which the anti-imperialist direction and the social nature of these
                        movements is reflected as in certain currents of African socialism
                        and the new left ideology.</p>
                        <p>Marxist-Leninist ideology opposes bourgeois ideology and
                        wages a relentless struggle against it for there can be no peaceful
                         coexistence with bourgeois ideology. Marxism Leninism is
                        not reconcilable with any attempts at revising scientific ideology
                        either from the right or from the left. The struggle against
                        bourgeois ideology and revisionism organically combined with
                        the creative development of Marxist Leninist theory constitutes
                        the tradition of Marxism Leninism. Providing scientific solutions
                         to the cardinal problems of contemporary social development,
                         Marxist Leninist ideology appears as the theoretical basis
                        of the communist movement as a powerful instrument for the
                        revolutionary transformation of the world.</p>

                        the use of technological means) as well as the processes themselves
                        of transmission or reception of the message.</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>Information has always played a very important part in human
                        life. However in the mid 20th century the role of information
                        increased immeasurablv as a result of social progress and the
                        vigorous development of science and technology. In addition, a
                        rapid expansion of a miss of diversified information is occurring
                        which has received the named information explosion. As a
                        result the need has arisen for a scientific approach to information
                        and for the elucidation of its most characteristic properties,
                        which has led to two principal changes in interpretation of the
                        concept of information. First it was broadened to include information
                         exchange not only between man and man but also between
                        man and machine and between machine and machine, as
                        well as the exchange of signals in ihe animal and plant worlds.
                        The transmission of characteristic traits from cell to cell and
                        from organism to organism also began to be regarded as the
                        transmission of information. Second a quantitative measure of
                        information was proposed (the works of C Shannon and A N
                        Kolmogorov) which led to the creation of information theory.</p>
                        <p>A more general approach to the concept of information than
                        was formerly used as well as the appearance of a precise quantitative
                        measure of information aroused great interest in the
                        study of information. Since the 1950's attempts have been undertaken
                         to use the concept of information (which does not as yet
                        have a unique definition) to clarify and describe extremely diverse
                        phenomena and processes.</p>
                        <p>The investigation of problems connected with the scientific
                        concept of information has proceeded in three principal directions.
                        The first of these consists of the development of a mathematical
                        apparatus reflecting the fundamental properties of
                        information.</p>
                        <p>The second direction consists of the theoretical development
                        of various aspects of information on the basis of already existing
                        mathematical methods and the investigation of various properties
                         of information. For example from the moment when information
                        theory was created the complex problem arose of the
                        measurement of the value of information with respect to its use.
                        In most work on information theory this property is not taken
                        into consideration however its importance cannot be doubted.
                        In the quantitative theory advanced in 1960 by A A Kharkevich
                         the value of information is defined as the increase in the
                        probability of achieving a given goal as the result of using a given
                        piece of information. Closely related studies such as those of
                        R Carnap attempt to give a strict mathematical definition of the
                        quantity of semantic information.</p>
                        <p>The third method is connected with the use of information
                        methods in linguistics, biology, psychology, sociology, education
                        and other fields. In linguistics, for example, measurements
                        of the informational capacity of languages have been realized.
                        After the statistical processing of a large number of texts, performed
                         with the help of computers as well as comparison of the
                        lengths of translations of a text into various languages and numerous
                        experiments on the guessing of letters in a text, it has
                        been ascertained that with a uniform load of spoken units of
                        information texts could be shortened by a factor of four or five.
                        Thus from this viewpoint the redundancy of natural languages
                        has been established as well as a rather precise measure of its
                        magnitude which is practically the same in all natural languages.
                         In neurophysiology information methods have helped
                        researchers to understand better the mechanism of the fundamental
                        law of psychophysics - the Weber Fechner law, which
                        asserts that sensation is proportional to the logarithm of excitation.
                        Precisely such a relation must exist if the nerve paths
                        transporting signals from the receptors to the brain are to have
                        properties inherent in the idealized communication channel
                        figuring in information theory. The information approach has
                        played an important role in genetics and molecular biology, and<pb n="275" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol10.0275"/>
                        has permitted in particular the role of the RNA molecule as a
                        carrier of information to be more deeply understood. Research
                        is also being carried out on the use of information methods in
                        studies of the arts.</p>
                        <p>Such a diversified use of the concept of information has stimulated
                         certain scholars to impart a general scientific significance to
                        it. The founders of such a general approach were the English
                        neurophysiologist W R Ashby and the French physicist
                        L Brilloum. They investigated questions of the common quality
                        of the concept of entropy in information theory and in thermodynamics
                         treating information as negative entropy (negentropy).
                        Brilloum and his followers began to study information processes
                        from the viewpoint of the second law of thermodynamics regarding
                         the transmission of information in a certain system as an
                        improvement in the system that leads to a decrease in its entropy.
                        In several philosophical works the thesis has been advanced that
                        information if one of the fundamental universal properties of
                        matter. The positive side to this approach is that it relates the
                        concept of information to the concept of reflection.</p>

                        The concept of culture
                        is used to characterize the material and spiritual level of development
                        of given historical periods, socioeconomic formations, specific
                        societies, nations (<foreign xml:lang="ru">

                        nations in the historical sense), and
                        peoples (for instance, the culture of antiquity, socialist culture,
                        and Mayan culture). It may also be applied to specific spheres
                        of activity or life (for example, the culture of labor, artistic
                        culture, and the culture of everyday life). In a narrower sense the
                        term <q>"culture"</q> refers only to human spiritual life.</p>

                        Originally, the concept
                        of culture meant the deliberate action of man on nature (such as
                        the cultivation of land), as well as the upbringing and education
                        of man. In that sense it included not only the inculcation of
                        existing norms and customs but also the stimulation of the desire
                        to follow these norms, which led to the belief that culture could
                        satisfy all of man's needs and demands. This duality in the
                        concept of culture is common to all societies.</p>
                        <p>Although the word <q>"culture"</q> did not become current in European
                        social thought until the second half of the 18th century,
                        more or less similar concepts can be found in the early stages of
                        European history and the history of other societies (<foreign xml:lang="zh">

                        <p>In addition to the concepts conveyed by the basic meaning of
                        the word <q>"culture"</q>, another complex of meanings emerged in
                        the late Roman period and became widespread in the Middle
                        Ages. It included a positive evaluation of the urban way of life
                        and was closer to the concept of <q>"civilization"</q>, which emerged
                        later. Increasingly, the word <q>"culture"</q> was associated with the
                        attributes of personal perfection, and above all, with religious
                        qualities. During the Renaissance perfection was understood as
                        conformity to the humanist ideal of man. Later, it was interpreted
                        as conformity to the Enlightenment ideal.</p>
                        <p>Characteristically, pre-Marxist bourgeois philosophy identifies
                        culture with the spiritual and political development of society

                            </cit>. Thus, representatives of the 18th-century
                        French Enlightenment, such as Voltaire, A. Turgot, and the
                        Marquis de Condorcet, reduced the content of the cultural-historical
                        process to the development of human <q>"reason"</q>. The level
                        of <q>"culture"</q> or <q>"civilization"</q> of a nation or country (as opposed
                        to the <q>"savagery"</q> and <q>"barbarity"</q> of primitive peoples) was
                        determined by the degree of <q>"rationality"</q> of its social system and
                        political institutions and measured by the totality of its accomplishments
                        in the arts and sciences. The aim of culture, which
                        corresponded to the highest purpose of <q>"reason"</q>, was to make
                        all people happy (the eudemonic conception of culture) and to
                        enable them to live in harmony with the demands and needs of
                        their original <q>"nature"</q> (the naturalistic conception of culture).
                        At the same time, a critique of culture and civilization developed
                        within the framework of the Enlightenment. It contrasted the
                        corruption and moral depravity of the <q>"cultured"</q> nations with
                        the simplicity and purity of the mores of peoples at the patriarchal
                        stage of development (J.-J. Rousseau).</p>
                        <p>Rousseau's critique of culture was adopted by the German
                        classical philosophers, who developed it into a general theoretical
                         conception of the contradictions and conflicts in bourgeois
                        civilization (including the division of labor, the dehumanizing
                        effects of technology, and the disintegration of the personality).
                        German philosophy sought a way out of this contradictory situation
                        in the <q>"spiritual"</q>; moral consciousness (I. Kant), aesthetic
                        consciousness (F. Schiller and the romantics), or philosophical
                        consciousness (G. Hegel), all of which were presented as the true
                        area for man's cultural existence and development. From this
                        viewpoint, culture is regarded as the area of man's <q>"spiritual
                        freedom"</q>, which lies beyond his natural and social existence and
                        is independent of his empirical aims and needs. Thus, the meaning
                        of all of human cultural-historical evolution lay in attaining
                        this freedom.</p>
                        <p>German historical philosophy recognized many distinct types
                        and forms of cultural development, which emerged in a definite
                        historical sequence and formed a single line of human spiritual
                        evolution. Thus, J. Herder regarded culture as the progressive
                        unfolding of the capacities of the human mind, but he used this
                        concept both to define stages of comparative human historical
                        development and to describe the values of the Enlightenment.
                        The German romantics (Schiller, W. and F. Schlegel, and
                        F. Schelling in his later works) continued to develop Herder's
                        dualistic interpretation of culture. On the one hand, they
                        founded the tradition of the comparative historical study of
                        culture (K. W. Humboldt and the school of comparative linguistics).
                        On the other hand, they laid the foundation for treating
                        culture as one of the problems of anthropology. A third line in
                        the study of culture - the concrete analysis of mores and of
                        ethnic characteristics - can be traced back to Herder. The mid-19th-century
                         historian G. F. Klemm, who treated culture as a
                        distinguishing trait of man, was the first to undertake such an
                        analysis.</p>
                        <p>In the late 19th century and the early 20th the universality of
                        existing evolutionary concepts of culture was subjected to criticism
                        by neo-Kantian idealists (H. Rickert and M. Weber). Culture
                        was regarded primarily as a specific system of values and
                        ideas with differing roles in the life and organization of various
                        types of societies. From a somewhat different point of view,
                        L. Frobenius and F. Graebner incorporated a similar idea of
                        culture into the <q>"theory of cultural circles"</q>, which was popular
                        until the early 1920's and is associated with the cultural-historical
                        school.</p>
                        <p>The theory of a single, linear evolution of culture was also
                        subjected to criticism from the irrational standpoint of <q>"the
                        philosophy of life"</q>, which juxtaposed to the linear evolutionary
                        theory the concept of <q>"local civilizations"</q>. These were regarded
                        as closed, self-sufficient, and unduplicable cultural organisms
                        passing through similar cycles of growth, maturation, and death
                        (0. Spengler). Characteristic of the theory of local civilizations
                        is the juxtaposition of culture and civilization, with the latter
                        regarded as the last stage in the development of a society. Similar
                        concepts were developed in Russia by N. Ia. Danilevskii and
                        later, P. A. Sorokin, and in Great Britain by A. Toynbee.</p>
                        <p>In some theories the critique of culture initiated by Rousseau
                        was carried to the point where the concept of culture was totally
                        rejected. The idea of man's <q>"natural anticulturalism"</q> was
                        proposed by such theories, which regarded all cultures as means
                        of oppressing and enslaving humanity (F. Nietzsche). The ultimate
                        degeneration of this position is found in fascist ideology.</p>
                        <p>Since the last third of the 19th century anthropologists and
                        ethnologists have also begun to study culture. This trend has led
                        to the shaping of a number of different approaches to culture.
                        Laying the foundation for cultural anthropology, the British
                        ethnologist E. Tylor defined culture by enumerating its concrete
                        elements, disregarding their relationship to the organization of
                        society and to the functions of individual cultural institutions. In
                        the early 20th century the American scholar F. Boas proposed
                        a method for the detailed study of the customs, language, and
                        other characteristics of the way of life of primitive societies and
                        a method of comparing them, which helped to reveal the historical
                        conditions under which they had emerged.</p>
                        <p>The ideas of the American scholar A. Kroeber have had considerable
                        influence on non-Marxist anthropology. Instead of
                        studying cultural customs, Kroeber advanced to the concept of
                        <q>"cultural patterns"</q>, the totality of which constituted a cultural
                        system. A serious flaw in the theory of cultural patterns was
                        engendered by Kroeber's refusal to apply the concept of social
                        determinism. In addition, his theory lacked an explanation for
                        the individual's reasons and motives for accepting and sustaining
                        these cultural patterns.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the theory of cultural patterns, which subordinated the
                        social structure to culture, the functional theories of culture
                        emphasized social structure, regarding culture as an organic<pb n="299" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol13.0299"/>
                        whole to be analyzed in terms of its institutions. First developed
                        by the British ethnologists and sociologists B. Malinowski and
                        A. Radcliffe-Brown, social anthropology regards structure as
                        the formal aspect of social interactions that are stable in time. It
                        defines culture as the system of rules for shaping structure, given
                        such interactions. The functions of culture are the shaping of
                        mutual relationships and the hierarchical ordering of the elements
                        of the social system.</p>
                        <p>The postulates of the functional theory of culture were challenged
                        by representatives of the structural-functional school of
                        non-Marxist sociology, including the American sociologists
                        T. Parsons, R. Merton, and E. Shils, who endeavored to develop
                        a general theory from the concepts of culture that had been
                        developed by cultural and social anthropologists. They also tried
                        to solve the problem of the relationship between culture and
                        society. In the structural-functional theory the concept of culture
                        is used to designate a system of values that determine the
                        development of patterns of human behavior. According to the
                        theory, culture is an organic part of the social system that determines
                        the level of orderliness and control within that system.</p>
                        <p>In the non-Marxist study of culture other approaches are also
                        being developed. For example, the concept of the communicative
                        characteristics of culture has grown out of the tendency in cultural
                        anthropology to study the role of culture in the transfer of
                        a social legacy from one generation to the next. Accordingly,
                        language came to be treated as a model for the study of the
                        cultural structure. This led to the introduction into the study of
                        culture of the methods of semiotics, structural linguistics, mathematics,
                        and cybernetics. The discipline that applies these methods
                        is known as structural anthropology. Its representatives
                        include the American ethnologist and linguist E. Sapir and the
                        French ethnologist C. Levi-Strauss. However, structural anthropology
                        incorrectly regards culture as an extremely stable
                        structure and fails to consider the dynamics of the historical
                        development of culture. It pays inadequate attention to the connection
                        between culture and the contemporary state of society
                        and fails to analyze the role of man as the creator of culture.</p>
                        <p>The attempt to solve the problem of <q>"culture and the personality"</q>
                        led to the emergence of a school of cultural psychology,
                        whose representatives include the Americans R. Benedict,
                        M. Mead, and M. Herskovits. They interpret culture as the generalization
                        on the level of society of the basic psychological states
                        characteristic of man. In their theory the representatives of the
                        school of cultural psychology rely on S. Freud's hypothesis that
                        culture is a mechanism for the social repression and sublimation
                        of childhood psychological impulses, as well as on the neo-Freudian
                        concept (presented by the Americans G. Róheim,
                        K. Homey, and H. Sullivan) that culture consists of the content
                        of direct psychological experiences preserved in symbols. Cultural
                        patterns came to be understood as the real mechanisms or
                        aids by which individuals solve the concrete problems of social
                        existence. Thus, culture came to be treated as a pattern or norm
                        to be internalized by a person and transformed into habits
                        (M. Mead and G. Murdock, USA).</p>
                        <p>The idealistic doctrines of the neo-Kantian E. Cassirer and
                        the Swiss psychologist and philosopher C. Jung provided the
                        foundation for the idea of the symbolic properties of culture.
                        Proceeding from the concept of local civilizations, a number of
                        the adherents of cultural psychology sought to discover a set of
                        <q>"cultural invariables"</q> not reducible to each other and having in
                        reality no common substratum. This view was reflected in Sapir's
                        and B. Whorf's theory of linguistic relativism, in Benedict's
                        studies of specific cultures as isolated <q>"cultural configurations"</q>,
                        and in the general position of Herskovits' cultural relativism. By
                        contrast, the adherents of the phenomenological approach to
                        culture, as well as some representatives of the existential philosophy
                        of culture, have advanced the hypothesis that culture has a
                        universal content that is latent in all individual cultures. They
                        based their view on any of a number of theories, including the
                        assertion of the universality of the structures of consciousness
                        (E. Husserl, of Germany), the postulate of the psychobiological
                        unity of mankind (Jung), or a belief in the existence of some
                        <q>"fundamental basis"</q> or <q>"original axis"</q> of culture, in relation to
                        which all its heterogeneous forms are only <q>"variants"</q> or <q>"ciphers"</q>.
                        (The last viewpoint was expressed by the German
                        philosophers M. Heidegger and K. Jaspers.)</p>
                        <p>With the contemporary acceleration of scientific and technological
                        progress, the exacerbation of contradictions in capitalist
                        society, the coexistence of two social systems, and the emergence
                        of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America into the arena
                        of history, many bourgeois sociologists and students of culture
                        are arriving at the conclusion that the idea of a single culture is
                        inconsistent with reality. This conclusion is expressed in the
                        theories of polycentrism and of the fundamental opposition between
                        East and West, which deny the universal laws of social
                        development. These theories are the opposite of oversimplified
                        technological theories, according to which the developed capitalist
                        countries have attained the highest level of culture.</p>
                        <p>The split between the humanities and technical knowledge is
                        reflected in the British writer C. P. Snow's theory of <q>"two cultures"</q>.
                        The increasing alienation of the individual in capitalist
                        society has stimulated various forms of cultural nihilism. The
                        representatives of this trend reject the notion of <q>"culture"</q> as a
                        fictitious, absurd invention. Theories of a <q>"counterculture"</q> (a
                        culture in opposition to the dominant bourgeois one) have
                        become popular among the radical intelligentsia and young people.</p>

                        Unlike bourgeois conceptions, the
                        Marxist-Leninist theory of culture is based on the fundamental
                        principles of historical materialism concerning socioeconomic
                        formations as sequential stages in the historical development of
                        society, the interrelationship between productive forces and production
                        relations and between the base and the superstructure,
                        and the class orientation of culture in a society ridden with class
                        antagonisms. Culture is a specific attribute of society that reflects
                        the level of historical development achieved by man and determin~
                        d by his relationship to nature and society. Thus, it is a
                        manifestation of the specific unity of man with nature and society
                        and represents the development of the creative powers and capacities
                        of the personality. It includes not only the results of
                        human activity (machines, technical devices, scientific discoveries,
                        works of art, and legal and ethical norms, for example) but
                        also subjective human powers and abilities that can be realized
                        in activity. (Among the latter are knowledge and skills, production
                        and professional techniques, the level of intellectual aesthetic,
                        and moral development, the world view, and means and
                        forms of human communication within the group and within
                        society.)</p>
                        <p>There are two aspects of culture - material and spiritual,
                        which correspond to the two basic forms of production (material
                        and spiritual). Material culture embraces all material activity
                        and its results (for example, the instruments of labor, dwellings,
                        household items, clothing, and means of transportation and
                        communication). <q>"Spiritual culture"</q> embraces the sphere of consciousness
                        and intellectual production (knowledge, morality, upbringing
                        and education, law, philosophy, ethics, aesthetics,
                        science, art, literature, mythology, and religion). The Marxist
                        theory of culture proceeds from the assumption of the organic
                        unity of material and spiritual culture. <cit>

                        <p>Every socioeconomic formation has its own historically complete
                        type of culture. Although changes in socioeconomic formations
                        are accompanied by changes in types of culture, this fact
                        does not entail a break in cultural development, the destruction
                        of the previous culture, or a rejection of cultural heritage and
                        traditions. Inevitably, each new formation inherits the cultural
                        achievements of its predecessor and includes them in the new
                        system of social relations. The Marxist theory of culture, which

                        peoples and societies, decisively rejects the practice of setting up

                            </cit>. Antagonistic formations are characterized by
                        a spontaneous, irregular cultural-historical process and an intensified
                        cultural differentiation of society. The culture of the ruling
                        class pushes the mental activity of the masses into the background,
                        although it is precisely this activity that defines the
                        universal human content of many of the most important achievements
                        of any national culture. As the class struggle intensifies,
                        an ever-increasing number of classes and social groups, hitherto
                        passive and alienated from higher cultural values, are drawn into
                        active public life. This development is accompanied by the democratization
                        of the mechanism of producing and distributing
                        cultural benefits. As a result, the illusoriness of the <q>"cultural
                        unity"</q> of society, which is proclaimed by the ruling classes,
                        becomes increasingly apparent. Cultural polarization, which begins
                        in the early stages of class society, becomes especially intense
                        in the epoch of modern capitalism, during which the
                        contradictions in social and cultural development become particularly
                        acute. The ruling classes try to saddle the masses with
                        a primitive <q>"mass culture."</q> At the same time, under capitalism,
                        in addition to the culture of the ruling class, a new culture in the
                        form of democratic and socialist elements begins to come forward

                        <p>The victory of the socialist revolution signifies a radical
                        upheaval in the development of a society and its culture. In the
                        socialist cultural revolution socialist culture is created and
                        affirmed. It inherits all that was valuable in the culture created
                        during the preceding stages of social development, and it heralds
                        a qualitatively new stage in the cultural development of mankind.
                        As determined by new forms of social relations and the
                        ascendency of the Marxist-Leninist world view, the fundamental
                        features of socialist spiritual culture are

                        patriotism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party the
                        development of socialist culture acquires for the first time in
                        history a consciously planned character. At every historical
                        stage it is determined, on the one hand, by the level of culture
                        achieved and by the material forces of production and, on the
                        other hand, by the socialist and communist ideal.</p>
                        <p>The most important aim of socialist culture is the shaping of
                        the new man, the transformation of the scientific Marxist-Leninist
                        world view into the conscious conviction of every member
                        of society, and the inculcation of every individual with high
                        moral qualities and the enrichment of his spiritual world. Besides
                        acting as a mechanism for the transfer of the progressive values
                        and traditions accumulated by society, socialist culture is called
                        upon to ensure the maximum opportunity for creativity, so as to
                        meet the pressing needs of society and spiritually and materially
                        enrich society and each individual. The main criterion of cultural
                        progress in a socialist society is the extent to which the historical
                        activity of the masses (that is, their practical activity) becomes
                        in its ends and means a creative activity based on the achievements
                        of material and spiritual culture.</p>
                        <p>The experience of the USSR, a multinational socialist state, is
                        a bright example of the development of socialist culture through
                        the interaction of national cultures. The Soviet socialist culture
                        formed since the establishment of the USSR is unified in its spirit
                        and fundamental content and contains the most valuable features
                        and traditions of the culture of each people of the USSR.
                        At the same time, each Soviet national culture is not dependent
                        only on its own cultural heritage but is enriched by the cultural
                        achievements of other peoples. The ever-increasing interaction of
                        the national socialist cultures leads to the growth of common
                        international features in each of them. Thus, Soviet culture-socialist
                        in its content and in the main direction of its development,
                        varied in its national forms, and international in its spirit
                        and character-represents an organic fusion of the spiritual values
                        created by all the peoples of the USSR. The growing rapprochement
                        of national cultures is an objective, progressive
                        process. The Communist Party opposes both the artificial forcing
                        of that rapprochement and any attempts to hold it back and
                        reinforce the separation of national cultures. Socialist culture is
                        a preliminary model of the worldwide spiritual culture of communist
                        society, which will have a universal human nature. <cit>

                        <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">Engels</name> 
                        and developed by <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name>. According to the theory, the
                        nation emerged as a new soctohistorical phenomenon when the
                        feudal fragmentation of society was being overcome and political
                        centralization based on capitalist economic ties was being consolidated.
                        The classical Marxist-Leninist theorists emphasized
                        the importance of the state in the consolidation of the nation.

                        is to confuse the nation with the race or tribe and to portray it
                        as a continuation and more complex development of tribal and
                        kinship ties and as an eternal, natural, suprahistorical phenomenon.
                        He criticized the views of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otto_Bauer">O. Bauer</name> who defined the nation
                        as a community of culture and character based on common

                        of a nation but is not a necessary condition for this
                        process. Furthermore a direct genetic line connecting the ethnic
                        attributes of a tribe, nationality, and nation is not necessary for
                        the consolidation of a nation. In fact, there are no homogeneous
                        nations. All nations grew out of disparate tribes. Some trace their
                        origins to several distinct nationalities. Many nations, including
                        the Americans, were formed not only from different ethnic
                        groups, but even from different races. Thus, racial homogeneity
                        cannot be included in the concept of nation. A nation cannot be
                        defined in terms of a common religion or state. Although some
                        nations profess one religion, others are made up of groups that
                        belong to different religions. There are single states that include
                        several different nations, and there are nations that do not have
                        a state.</p>
                        <p>
                        In the history of a nation and in its relations with other
                        nations, ethnic characteristics (language, culture, and customs)
                        are very important. They are not biologically determined, but are
                        the product of social development. When different ethnic groups
                        live and act together in the framework of a fully developed
                        nation, a new ethnic (or national) character is produced, in
                        which it is possible to trace certain <q>"lasting"</q> elements inherited
                        from earlier historical communities. For all their durability,
                        however, even these lasting elements are not unchangeable.
                        Thus the nation is essentially a sociohistorical phenomenon.</p>

                        Before a common economic life can develop, there must be a common
                        territory. A common territory is a necessary condition for the
                        formation of a nation and, subsequently, one of a nation's distinguishing
                        features. During the consolidation of a nation a common
                        literary language develops in various ways and becomes a
                        powerful means for forging national ties. A common cultural life
                        also arises, based on the long common experience of people
                        linked by a single economy, territory, and language.</p>

                        Although the founders of Marxism-Leninism considered a
                        unified cultural life important to the development of a nation,
                        they stressed the contradictory character of the culture and psychology
                        of a nation made up of hostile classes. Bearing in mind
                        the opposition between bourgeois-landlord and clerical culture

                        These two cultures are created by
                        representatives of the same nationality who are also representatives
                        of <quote>"two different nations within one nation,"</quote> with distinct
                        social ideologies and psychologies. Nonetheless it is correct to
                        speak of the psychological traits of a nation as one of its distinctive
                        features.</p>
                        <p>
                        Common economic ties, a common language and territory,
                        and certain traditions and characteristics of a national culture
                        and psychology give rise to a national unity—a national consciousness.
                        Once it has emerged, national consciousness becomes
                        an important factor in the existence and development of a nation
                        It begins to function not only as an objective tie among people,
                        but also as a tie based on consciousness in a broader sense,
                        including consciousness of a common ethnic background, national language, 
                        homeland, culture, certain set of relations with
                        other nations, and feeling of national pride.</p>
                        <p>
                        The vitality and activity of a nation are to a considerable
                        extent determined by the character and degree of national consciousness.
                        Nevertheless, the antagonistic classes and their parties adhere 
                        to opposing views and develop opposing political
                        lines for promoting national consciousness. 
                        The Marxist-Leninist parties promote national consciousness in a manner consistent
                        with the true national interests which are inseparably linked
                        with the international unity of the working people of all countries.
                        The bourgeois and petit bourgeois ideologists however
                        distort national consciousness and pretend that narrow egoistic
                        nationalistic interests are the true national interests.</p>
                        <p>
                        The formation of different nations is determined by the correlation
                        of economic, political, and ethnic factors as well as by the
                        <pb n="356" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0356"/>
                        character of the historical epoch. In some cases the processes of
                        a nation's formation and the conditions for its existence run
                        parallel and supplement each other. For example, the first European
                        nations were based on major, well-developed nationalities
                        that had a common language, territory, and various ethnic features
                        that were conditions for the formation of these nations. In
                        other cases nations have come into existence before all the conditions
                        for their formation are fully ready. Thus, in a number of
                        Asian and African countries nations have developed during the
                        struggle for independence and particularly after the winning of
                        independence. Such nations emerge on territory that has been
                        shaped historically by colonial partitioning and is inhabited by
                        tribes and nationalities with different languages, cultures, and
                        economic ties. They become the form for the territorial and
                        economic consolidation and political and cultural development
                        of the countries in which they arise. It is necessary to keep in
                        mind that the formation of a nation is not a universal stage of
                        development for all peoples of the world. Many numerically
                        small peoples, such as tribes and territorial linguistic groups,
                        have merged with larger nations.</p>
                        <p>
                        In order to arrive at a correct understanding of the essence of
                        the nation and the role and significance of its ethnic characteristics
                        it is necessary to recognize the differences between such
                        related, but not identical concepts as <term xml:lang="ru">
                                <hi rend="italic">natsiia</hi>
                            </term> 
                        and <term xml:lang="ru">
                                <hi rend="italic">natsional'nost'</hi>
                            </term>.
                        The term <term xml:lang="ru">
                                <hi rend="italic">natsional'nost'</hi>
                            </term> which signifies a common ethnicity, is
                        only one of the factors contributing to a nation or to nationhood.
                        Thus, <term xml:lang="ru">
                                <hi rend="italic">natsional'nost'</hi>
                            </term> is a narrower concept than <q>"nation"</q>. The
                        distinction between the two concepts helps explain why a group
                        of people who are of the <term xml:lang="ru">
                                <hi rend="italic">natsional'nost'</hi>
                            </term> of a particular nation but
                        who do not live on its territory are not members of that nation.
                        Also, it is clear why a nation or nationality under socialism
                        radically changes its social essence while retaining its <term xml:lang="ru">
                                <hi rend="italic">natsional'nost'</hi>

                        <p>
                        During socialist construction exploitative classes and antagonisms
                        within and between nations are eliminated. Nations undergo
                        fundamental changes, and the nations of capitalist society
                        are transformed into socialist nations. Preserving their distinctive
                        ethnic traits or modifying them to some extent, nations
                        fundamentally change their social type and become socialist in
                        their class structure, political system, and cultural makeup. To
                        a great extent, the original characteristics of the nation are given
                        new content, and new traits appear, the product of the nation's
                        socialist and international life.</p>
                        <p>
                        The development of the socialist nations and their social,
                        political, and ideological unity are based on the establishment of
                        a genuinely common economic life in each of them. In the multinational
                        states the unity of interests of the working people of all
                        nations emerges. The common territory, a condition for the
                        existence of a socialist nation, acquires a new quality. The borders
                        of national republics (for example, in the 
                        <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">USSR</name>) lose their
                        former significance and do not promote national exclusiveness.
                        Contacts of every kind are maintained among the Soviet nations,
                        which seek to rationally utilize the entire territory of the 
                        <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">USSR</name>
                        as the common property of the <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_nation">Soviet people</name>.</p>
                        <p>
                        Socialism creates the most favorable conditions for the development
                        of national languages. In addition to the native tongue,
                        the knowledge of a language of international communication,
                        such as Russian has become in the <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">USSR</name>, contributes to the
                        mutual enrichment of the national cultures, which are national
                        in form and socialist in content. On the basis of their common
                        economic, social, ideological, and political ties, the socialist nations 
                        develop the international features of their cultures, and the
                        national cultures draw closer together. While preserving their
                        progressive cultural heritage, the socialist nations create new
                        cultural values that become the common property of all the
                        peoples. The national and international elements in the culture
                        of the socialist nations make up an integral whole in which the
                        international aspect is dominant. With the building of communism
                        new traditions develop, bringing the socialist nations closer
                        together, uniting them, and strengthening their shared cultural
                        values.</p>
                        <p>
                        The new features of socialist nations are formed under the
                        decisive influence of the working class, the leading international
                        force in the nation. Under socialism, revolutionary changes in all
                        aspects of social, economic, political, and cultural life give rise
                        to a socialist national consciousness. In mature socialist society
                        an intensive, integrated process is under way in which each
                        nation flourishes and all nations draw closer together. The socialist
                        nations can truly thrive not through national isolation but
                        through an internationalized economy and politics, a unified
                        ideology, and the development of international features in their
                        culture and cultural life. For this reason, the flourishing of 
                        nations promotes their drawing together, which, in turn, promotes
                        their flourishing.</p>
                        <p>
                        One of the most essential characteristics of the socialist nations is 
                        their fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance based
                        on the principles of socialist internationalism, which have given
                        rise to new international communities such as the 
                        <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_nation">Soviet people</name>
                        and the ever stronger commonwealth of socialist peoples.</p>
                        <p>
                        Under communist construction the drawing together of nations 
                        is accelerated, leading to the obliteration of differences
                        among them that are associated with outdated forms of existence
                        and resulting in the amalgamation of small ethnic groups. The obliteration
                        of national differences is a more prolonged process
                        than the breakdown of class difference.s The complete integration
                        of nations will take place as a result of their further flowering
                        and their gradual drawing together in all spheres of life.
                        Communists do not advocate making national distinctions eternal 
                        and everlasting and support the objective, progressive, comprehensive
                        drawing together of nations, which creates the conditions
                        for their ultimate fusion and integration on a fully
                        voluntary and democratic basis. Marxist-Leninists are equally
                        opposed to retarding this process and to forcing it artificially.</p>
                        <p>
                        A clear knowledge of the prospects for national development
                        are especially important to the socialist countries, whose social
                        relations, including national relations, are scientifically guided
                        and directed toward a definite goal. On the basis of Marxist-
                        Leninist theory, it is possible to predict that the victory of communism
                        throughout the world will create the conditions
                        necessary for the amalgamation of nations and that all people
                        will belong to a worldwide human society free from classes or
                        nations, with a unified economy and a unified communist culture,
                        tremendously rich and varied.</p>

            depends on the rate and special conditions of the development of a nationality into a nation among various peoples.</p>
                        <p>A national language is a system of several forms of a language - the literary language (oral and written), popular conversational varieties of the
            language, and dialects. In the course of the formation of a national language, the relationship between literary language and dialect undergoes a
            substantial change. The national literary language is the most important developing form of a language, it gradually supplants the dialects that
            dominated the earlier stages of language development, especially in oral communication. Under the influence of a literary language, the formation of
            new dialectal features comes to an end and a leveling of clear-cut dialectal differences occurs. At the same time, the literary language gains wider
            acceptance and application and its functions become more complex. The literary form of a language becomes dominant as a result of the increasing
            complexity and development of the national culture of a people. The literary language, basing itself on the language of the people, supplants
            written languages that are alien to the people, such as Latin in Western Europe and Church Slavonic in Russia. The national literary language also
            becomes the standard for oral communication, where previously dialect was dominant.</p>
                        <p>An extremely important characteristic of a national literary language is its normalizing tendency. In order to satisfy the increasingly complex and
            diverse needs of society that arise from the development of literature, journalism, and science and technology, as well as from the emergence of
            various forms of oral speech, the syntactic system and vocabulary of a national literary language develop intensively and become enriched.</p>
                        <p>In bourgeois society, the national literary language serves primarily the dominant stratum of society, that is, its educated classes. As a rule,
            the rural population continues to use dialects, while in cities, urban dialects compete with the literary language. In socialist nations, as a
            result of the democratization of society and the widespread dissemination of education, a uniform, normalized, universally accepted national
            literary language becomes the property of every member of the nation.</p>

                        <p>National movements appeared in one form or another even in the precapitalist epoch, under feudalism. The national oppresion and national conflicts
            that gave rise to these movements were engendered by private property relations and exploitation. In the national movements of the precapitalist
            epoch, nationalities and national groups fought against foreign domination and defended their own existence (for example, the struggle of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/South_Slavs">the South Slavs</name> against the Turkish yoke, the struggle of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Czechs">the Czech people</name> against their German masters and the struggle of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Armenians">the Armenians</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgians">Georgians</name> against the Turkish and Persian conquerors).</p>
                        <p>The capitalist epoch brought into being massive national movements of the people as a whole and the first national liberation revolutions. The

                            </foreign> nations in the historical sense) and the rise
            of national consciousness led to an abrupt sharpening of the contradictions between the foreign masters and the oppressed peoples and drew broad
            strata of the peasantry and the urban population into the struggle against foreign domination. The economic basis this process was the development
            of capitalist relations and the formation of a nationwide market. The national aspirations of peoples who did not have statehood or who had been
            deprived of it met with opposition from the exploiting classes of the dominant nations. This was true, for example, of the national aspirations of
              <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poles">the Polish people</name>, who had fallen under the yoke of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Empire">tsarist Russia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria–Hungary">Austro-Hungary</name>, of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Czechs">the Czechs</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slovaks">Slovaks</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slovenes">Slovenians</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Croats">Croats</name>, and other peoples held captive in the <q>"prisonhouse of nations"</q> - <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Austria–Hungary">the Austro-Hungarian Empire</name>, and of <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgarians">the Bulgarians</name>, <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbs">Serbs</name>,

            national aspirations of various peoples, national movements seeking self-determination emerged. Bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic, and antifeudal in
            character, they were led by the bourgeoisie, which subsequently took control of the new nation-states.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the uneven development of capitalist relations national movements and national liberation revolutions developed at different times in
            different parts of the world. During the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries and the first half of the 19th, nations were formed, national movements
            developed, and nation-states were created in Western Europe, North Amenca, and Russia (for example, the Dutch bourgeois revolution and the War of
            Independence in North America). In the second half of the 19th century, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Germany">Germany</name>
                        and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Italy">Italy</name> were unified, and nation-states <pb n="373" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0373"/> emerged in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Romania">Rumania</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serbia">Serbia</name>.

                national liberation which involved millions of people, with the destruction of feudalism, absolutism, and foreign
                      oppression"</quote>

            Observing that as a result of these national movements and wars the era of national liberation revolutions in Europe had essentially been completed,
              <name type="person" key=" http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name> conceded that under certain conditions such movements might
            develop again. This proposition was confirmed during World War II, when the struggle of the European peoples against Hitlerism was, to a
            considerable degree, a national liberation struggle.</p>
                        <p>During the 20th century national movements and national liberation revolutions have developed primarily in Asia, Africa, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name>, which were for many centuries the chief regions for the expansion of the
            European powers and the building of colonial empires. After freeing itself from Spanish domination in the I9th century, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> became subject to the US imperialists. At the turn of the 20th century, as
            capitalism entered the imperialist stage, the expansion of the imperialist states reached an unparalleled scope and acquired new characteristics.
            The colonial system of imperialism emerged. The tendency toward closer, supranational economic relations among peoples was promoted by the
            development of productive forces, the use of crude violence, and the enslavement of peoples. The countries of Asia, Africa, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> became the objects of national oppression and exploitation by monopoly
            capital. In these countries the national liberation revolutions are a manifestation of the extreme sharpening of the contradictions between
            imperialism and the oppressed peoples.</p>
                        <p>The national liberation revolutions in the colonies and dependent countries of the contemporary world differ from the national movements of the
            past in several important respects. They are antifeudal revolutions, but above all, they are antiimperialist revolutions—component parts of the
            world revolutionary process and an active force contributing to the destruction of imperialism. Closely connected with the struggle of socialist
            forces the national liberation revolutions are the objective allies of the socialist movement. The Great October Socialist Revolution opened the
            epoch of national liberation revolutions and linked the national liberation movements with the socialist revolution in practice. The development of
            socialism into a world system and the further deepening and intensification of the general crisis of capitalism led to victorious national
            liberation revolutions in the colonies and dependent countries and culminated in the collapse of the colonial system of imperialism. The socialist
            system gives powerful support to the national liberation movement and blocks military reprisals by the colonialists against the peoples who rise up
            in arms. <cit>

                        <p>During the postwar period (1945-73) more than I.5 billion people have thrown off the colonial and semicolonial yoke, and more than 70 new nation
            states have emerged. With the existence of two world systems and a new relationship of forces in the world arena, the peoples enslaved by
            imperialism have won independence by nonmilitary means (<name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India">India</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</name>, and most of the African countries), as well as by armed struggle (for example, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indonesia">Indonesia</name> and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Algeria">Algeria</name>).</p>
                        <p>Under contemporary conditions the national liberation movement is directed not only against particular colonial powers, but against the colonial
            system as a whole. At the same time, the imperialist powers, despite contradictions among themselves, coordinate their actions against the national
            liberation forces, relying on a common, worldwide strategy and often working in a united front.</p>
                        <p>The main driving forces in today's national liberation revolutions are the working class—the most consistent champion of the national interests,
            social progress, and carrying the revolution through to the end—and the peasantry, which plays a significant role in the anti-imperialist liberation
            struggle. In the countries of Asia, Africa, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> strata of
            the urban petite bourgeoisie, the patriotic <foreign xml:lang="ru">intelligentsia</foreign>, and the army also play an active and important role in
            the national liberation struggle. These groups are often characterized by strong anti-imperialist and anticapitalist attitudes, and, as has been
            demonstrated by experience, under certain conditions they may take revolutionary democratic positions. The national bourgeoisie participates in the
            national liberation movement, often providing it with leadership. Profound economic and political contradictions between it and the colonialists and
            the foreign monopolies impel the national bourgeoisie to fight against these groups. However, fear of the masses, as well as narrow class interests,
            promote the tendency of the national bourgeoisie to compromise with imperialism.</p>
                        <p>In the past the bourgeoisie usually led the national movement, the victory of which resulted in the formation of a bourgeois state. Under
            contemporary conditions, in a number of countries the possibility has arisen for the working class and the peasantry to lead the national movements
            and ensure their culmination in the creation of working people's states. This possibility has become a reality in a number of Asian countries. In
            colonial and dependent countries where revolutionary democratic forces lead the struggle for national liberation, the nation-states established
            after the victory of the revolution have chosen to develop along socialist lines.</p>
                        <p>In the national liberation revolutions of the epoch of developing capitalism, the aim of national liberation was essentially achieved when a colony
            broke its political ties with the metropolitan country. Today, when foreign monopolies retain control over the economies of former colonies, the
            conquest of political independence does not free the people from their status as an exploited nation. Although the creation of a nation-state
            represents a victory for the people of the former colony, it fails to fulfill completely the goals of the national liberation revolution. Therefore,
            with the collapse of the colonial system, the national liberation revolution enters a new stage, the struggle for economic independence. A national
            liberation revolution <cit>
                                <quote>"does not end with the winning of political independence. Independence will be unstable and will become fictitious unless the revolution
                brings about radical changes in the social and economic spheres and solves the pressing problems of national rebirth"</quote>
                                <ref>(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> p 46)</ref>
                            </cit>. As a rule, the contradiction between oppressed and oppressor nations takes the form of a conflict between politically independent countries
            and imperialism, leads to a deepening of the revolution, and results in its entry into the stage of fundamental social and economic transformations.
            This new stage of the national liberation revolution is associated with the question of the direction to be taken by the social and economic
            development of the liberated countries. The problem of social and economic progress becomes the main link in the revolutionary process.</p>
                        <p>In many countries the struggle for national liberation has become a struggle against exploitative relations, both feudal and capitalist. In the
            present epoch capitalism cannot guarantee the nationally independent development of countries that have broken away from colonial domination, nor
            can it ensure sufficiently rapid economic growth. The noncapitalist path—that is, development toward socialism—provides the most favorable
            conditions for economic progress and corresponds to the interests of the majonty of nations.</p>

                        <p>In exploitative class society the national question arises with the struggle of nations and peoples for national liberation and for the most
            favorable conditions possible for their social development. After the victory of the socialist revolution and under socialist society, the national
            question includes problems arising in the relations between nations and peoples and associated with the establishment of friendship and voluntary
            unification, consolidation of unity, and drawing together in every way on the basis of complete equality. According to Marxist-Leninist theory the
            national question is subordinate to the general question of the social and political advancement of society. Marxism-Leninism proceeds from the view
            that the most important aspect of the national question is the unification of the working people, regardless of their nationality, in the struggle
            against all forms of oppression and for a progressive social system.</p>
                        <p>The oppression and exploitation of some peoples by others and the struggle for liberation began in slaveholding society and continued under
            feudalism. The national question became fully developed in the period of the decline of feudalism and the rise of capitalism, when nations were
            being formed. The question still exists and is manifested in the struggle against national oppression and in intrastate relations between nations
            and peoples. After the victory of communism throughout the world the national question will wither away completely with the merging and
            disappearance of all nations.</p>
                        <p>The ideologists of the bourgeoisie who led the national liberation movement in Europe and the American colonies from the 16th to 19th centuries
            regarded the "principle of nationality" (the <q>"right to a nation"</q>) as the key to the solution of the national question. According to this
            pnnciple the creation of one's <q>"own"</q> national state was a necessity under any and all circumstances. <ref>
                                <quote>"One nation—one
                state"</quote> was the slogan of the Italian <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasquale_Stanislao_Mancini">Mancini</name>,
              the Belgian <name type="person">Laurent</name>, and the Russians <name type="person">A Gradovskii</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolay_Yakovlevich_Danilevsky">N Danilevskii</name>
                            </ref>. The principle of nationality transformed the
            national element into an absolute. However the principle was extended only to <q>"civilized"</q> peoples. The bourgeoisie used it to distract the
                        proletariat from the class struggle and tried to divide <pb n="377" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0377"/> the working class by fostering nationalistic prejudices and inciting national
            animosities and hatred. Nonetheless, during the bourgeois revolutions and the formation of bourgeois national states the principle of nationality
            played a positive role in the struggle against the legacy of feudal fragmentation and national oppression. Under the conditions of premonopoly
            capitalism the formation of national states alleviated the national question in some cases.</p>
                        <p>With the growth of capitalism into imperialism, the bourgeoisie in the major countries undertook more extensive colonial conquests, divided up the
            world, and abandoned the principle of nationality. The national question ceased to be only an internal issue and became an international one
            involving the emancipation of all peoples from imperialist enslavement. Having become an independent political force, the proletariat advanced its
            own program for solving the national question.</p>

            national question. They showed that national relations have a concrete historical character and are determined by the social and state system, the
            relationship of class forces within a country and in the international arena, and the national policies of the ruling classes. At the same time, the
            relations between nations and peoples affect social relations and the class struggle. In different historical periods, different aspects of the
            national question may come to the fore—for example, the struggle for political or economic independence or the problems of language and culture.

            nations to self-determination is unattainable in the epoch of imperialism and superfluous under socialism.</p>
                        <p>Scientific principles for the national policy of the revolutionary Marxist party were elaborated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">Lenin</name>. In the Draft Program of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party">Russian Social Democratic Labor Party</name> (1902) he asserted that the
            right of nations to self-determination was the key to the national question. The main theses of his theory on the national question became the basis
            for the practical work and programmatic documents of the <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comintern">Comintern</name> and
            the Communist parties.</p>
                        <p>Under capitalism there are two hislorical tendencies in the national question. The first is the awakening of national life and national movements,
            the struggle against all forms of national oppression, and the creation of national states. The second is the development and growing frequency of
            international relations in every form, the breakdown of national barriers, and the establishment of the international unity of capital, economic
            life, politics, science, and the world market. The first tendency prevails in the epoch of rising capitalism and the second in the epoch of
            imperialism <ref>(<bibl>

                                    </title>, 5th ed , vol 24, p 124</bibl>)</ref>. Both tendencies are reflected in Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question,
            in its recognition of the right of nations to self-determination, and in its defense of the principles of the voluntary unification of nations,
            proletarian internationalism, and solidarity among the workers of all countries in the struggle against imperialism.</p>
                        <p>In the bourgeois-democratic stage of development the national question is part of the general question of the bourgeois democratic revolution, and
            its solution is subordinate to the goals of that revolution (for example, the elimination of the vestiges of feudalism). When conditions are ripe
            for socialist transformations, the national question is part of the general question of the socialist revolution and the building of socialism. This
            does not imply any underestimation of the national question. The working class and its Marxist-Leninist parties are the most consistent fighters for
            the just resolution of the national question and are staunch defenders of the national sovereignty of all nations and peoples. The right of all
            nations and peoples to determine their own destinies independently is recognized.</p>
                        <p>The right of nations to self-determination means that each nation is free to establish any of various types of relations with other peoples,
            including voluntary union in a single state, autonomy, federation, and even secession and the formation of an independent state. It also implies
            independent decision-making on all questions of internal organization, such as choice of social system and type of government. According to
            Marxist-Leninist theory, the question of the secession of a nation should be decided on the basis of whether it is feasible and useful from the
            standpoint of social development in general and the struggle for world peace and socialism. If one bears in mind that there are 2,000 nations and
            peoples inhabiting almost 140 states, it becomes evident that most nations and nationalities can solve the national question only within the
            framework of multinational states.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the question of the formal (legal) equality of nations, Marxism-Leninism raises the question of their attaining actual economic and
            cultural equality. The cohesion, unification, and comprehensive drawing together of nations can be reached only by their total emancipation from
            national and social oppression and by the creation of the most favorable possible conditions for the development of each of them. This is the

                        <p> In the period of premonopoly capitalism the solution of the national question was associated with the national liberation movements, which
            originated with the formation of nations. The winning of independence by the British colonies in North America in 1775-83 hastened the formation of
            the North American nation, and the liberation of the South American colonies between 1810 and 1826 laid the foundation for the formation of the
            Latin American nations. Liberation from the Turkish yoke during the 19th century opened the way for the formation of the Greek, Serbian, Rumanian,
            and Bulgarian nations and national states. In Germany and Italy unification was the solution to the national question. Under imperialism, with the
            division of the entire world into a handful of dominant nations and a majority of oppressed nations, the striving for independence and national
            consolidation was suppressed by force.</p>
                        <p>The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution opened the era of the social and national emancipation of the peoples of the world. The
            liberation movement encompassed all of Asia, Africa, and South Amenca. With the shift in the world balance of forces in favor of socialism after
            World War II (1939-45), there was an upsurge in the national liberation movement. In the three decades since World War II more than 70 new states
            have emerged. As a result of the efforts of the Soviet Union, which have been supported by the other socialist countries and by the <pb n="378" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0378"/>
            developing countries, the principle of self-determination has become a principle in international law. It is written into the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Nations_Charter">UN Charter</title>, and it was included in the resolutions of the Bandung Conference of
            Asian and African states in 1955 and in the resolutions of the conferences of nonaligned countries in Belgrade (1961), Cairo (1964) Lusaka (1970),
            and Algiers (1973). For many oppressed peoples, the content of the national question changes after independence is won, when the national question
            becomes separate from the colonial question.</p>
                        <p>Owing to problems inherited from colonialism and to the intrigues of the neocolonialists, the national question became the source of sharp conflict
            after independence in many Asian and African countries, including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nigeria">Nigeria</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyprus">Cyprus</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pakistan">Pakistan</name>. The boundaries of many new states inhabited by different nationalities and tribes were established without taking into account
            the ethnic factor. In many cases, the same ethnic group is found in two or in several different states, especially in Africa. Because
            self-determination proceeded not on a national basis but usually on a historic one (that is, within the former colonial administrative units) and
            because the nations were not fully formed, the processes of national consolidation in these countries are extremely complex. In a state made up of
            various ethnic groups, one or several nations may be taking shape.</p>
                        <p>In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latin_America">Latin America</name> the national question involves the relations between the
            population of European origin and the native or non-European population which consists of the Indians and some of the Negroes. The native Indian
            population is numerous in such countries as <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bolivia">Bolivia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ecuador">Ecuador</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peru">Peru</name> and speaks its
            own languages and dialects. The still unassimilated part of the Negroid population (in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brazil">Brazil</name>, for example) no longer has its own language. In some Latin American countries, including <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haiti">Haiti</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guyana">Guyana</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jamaica">Jamaica</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinidad_and_Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</name>, the national question touches on relations between the
            population of African origin, which constitutes the majority in some countries, and other national groups, such as those of European or Indian
            origin. To some extent, the special historical characteristics of the formation of the Latin American nations, which are reflected particularly in
            the absence of rigid racial and ethnic barriers and a high degree of racial intermarriage, point toward the solution of the national question.
            Progressive forces in the Latin American countries believe that the solution of the national question lies in the establishment of national and
            racial equality, the granting of autonomy to the Indian groups prevailing in certain areas, the development of the languages and cultures of
            national minorities, and noncompulsory assimilation.</p>
                        <p>In the 1960s and 1970's the national liberation movement entered a new stage. The struggle for national liberation in many countries began to grow
            into a struggle against exploitative relations both feudal and capitalist. Many newly emancipated peoples have rejected capitalism and are grappling
            with the tasks of noncapitalist development, or development toward socialism, which will facilitate and accelerate the solution of the national
            question.</p>
                        <p>In the countries of advanced capitalism relations are growing worse between peoples who have lived in a single state for centuries (for example,
            the conflicts between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walloons">the Walloons</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flemish_people">the Flemings</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium">Belgium</name> and between <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Canadian">French</name> and <name type="people" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_Canadian">English Canadians</name> in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada">Canada</name>, the Irish question in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain">Great Britain</name>, and the Negro
            question in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States">the USA</name>). The question of the unequal status and oppression of
            millions of foreign migrant workers emerged between the 1950's and the I970's in the developed capitalist countries, particularly in Western Europe.
            The intensification of national conflicts in the capitalist countries is connected with the aggravation of social antagonisms, the growth of
            national consciousness, and the impossibility of achieving a just, democratic solution to the national question under capitalism.</p>
                        <p>Under socialism each nation develops comprehensively toward convergence with all other nations and fraternal mutual assistance among nations. A
            vivid example of this is the way in which the national question has been solved in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the USSR</name>. In <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Empire">tsarist Russia</name>, which was called a <q>"prisonhouse
              of nations,"</q> the national question was very acute and was expressed in many ways. Some peoples sought the restoration of their lost national
            statehood. For others the national question was bound up with the colonial question, and for still others it involved the struggle for national
            equality. The first official documents of the Soviet government—the <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decree_on_Peace">Decree on
            Peace</title>, <title key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Declaration_of_Rights_of_Peoples_of_Russia">the Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of
              Russia</title> and <title>the Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited Peoples</title>—proclaimed a number of principles as the basis of
            the national policy of the socialist state the right of peoples and nations to self-determination, equality, and sovereignty, the abolition of all
            national privileges and restrictions, the right of national minorities to develop freely; and socialist federation. The Soviet government recognized
            the independence of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poland">Poland</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finland">Finland</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Latvia">Latvia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lithuania">Lithuania</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estonia">Estonia</name>, the Soviet republics of <name type="place">Transcaucasia</name>, <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belarus">Byelorussia</name>, and <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ukraine">Ukraine</name>, all of which had been part of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russian_Empire">the Russian Empire</name>. The rights of the peoples who did not wish to secede were
            constitutionally guaranteed by Soviet power.</p>
                        <p>To combat imperialist intervention and domestic counterrevolution the Soviet republics created a close political, military, and economic alliance.
            Somewhat later, considering the advantages of a large state, they raised the question of unification into a single multinational socialist state. A
            nationwide movement for unification led to the formation of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the Union of Soviet
              Socialist Republics</name> in 1922. This outstanding event in the history of mankind confirmed the correctness of Leninist national policy. The
            party charted a course toward the accelerated economic, cultural, social, and political development of the national borderlands. The implementation
            of this policy was possible in practice because of the comprehensive assistance rendered to the formerly oppressed nations and nationalities by the
            more developed parts of the country, especially by the Russian people, and in particular by the Russian working class, which performed a truly
            heroic feat, making sacrifices in order to overcome the backwardness of the outlying national regions. The national republics received regular
            subsidies from the all Union budget. Socially and economically, the national regions developed more rapidly than the center of the country. For a
            long time their inhabitants were exempt from taxation, and national cadres were given highly preferential treatment in admission to educational
            institutions. Enormous opportunities for developing science and the national culture were extended to all nations and peoples, and they experienced
            an unparalleled flowering.</p>
                        <p>Relations between the Soviet socialist republics are based on the principle of socialist federation, according to which each republic is a
            sovereign state. Thus, each republic is guaranteed both national statehood and membership in the union on the basis of the principles of democratic
            centralism, socialist federalism, and socialist democracy. If a nation or nationality cannot form its own union republic because it is too small or
            does not constitute the majority on the territory it occupies, the principle of socialist autonomy is applied. Under this principle, nations and
            nationalities may form republics, autonomous <foreign xml:lang="ru">oblasts</foreign>, or national <foreign xml:lang="ru">okrugs</foreign>.</p>
                        <p>Thus, all peoples are guaranteed self-government and protection of their national interests, including the development of the national culture,
            national schools, and respect for the national customs and religion. In all aspects of social and political life citizens are guaranteed the use of
            their native language. All nations and nationalities have freely chosen Russian as the common language for countrywide communication and
            cooperation. For millions of Soviet peoples, Russian has become a second native language.</p>
                        <p>Consistent adherence to the principles of the Marxist-Leninist national program has enabled the Soviet peoples to solve the national question
            inherited by them and to create a powerful multinational state that harmoniously blends the interests of the entire society with the interests of
            each nation and each people. The solution of the national question in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the
              USSR</name> is one of the most important achievements of socialism and has great international significance. A new historic community of
              peoples—<name type="people">the Soviet people</name>— has emerged in <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the
              USSR</name> under the impact of various powerful unifying factors that include a single socialist economy, an internationalist Marxist-Leninist
            ideology, the common historical destiny of all the peoples and nationalities; and the joint struggle against imperialism, aggression, and
            exploitation and for peace and communism. The further drawing together of nations is an objective historical process. It is harmful to force this
            process ahead and absolutely impermissible to hold <pb n="379" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0379"/> it back. Either approach would slow down this progressive process and contradict
            the general line of development of Soviet society and the interests of communist construction. The socialist countries that emerged after World War
            II have, in practice, confirmed and supplemented the experience of <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soviet_Union">the USSR</name>
            in solving the national question. Principles such as socialist federation, socialist autonomy, and the legal and real equality of nations and
            peoples are being successfully implemented in the socialist states. A new type of fraternal intergovernmental relations has arisen in the socialist
            countries. However, the socialist system only creates the objective preconditions for the resolution of the national question. Its actual solution
            depends chiefly on the subjective factor—that is, on the policies of the parties providing the leadership of society. If a party abandons the
            Marxist-Leninist line on the national question and relaxes the struggle against nationalism and chauvinism and the effort to educate the workers in
            the spirit of internationalism, national problems may grow more intense. By deviating from Marxism-Leninism and the principles of internationalism
            and pursuing a policy of Great Han chauvinism, <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_Party_of_China">the Communist
              Party of China</name> has greatly exacerbated national problems, both inside <name type="place" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/China">China</name> and among states of the socialist community.</p>
                        <p>The tasks of building a developed socialist society and a communist society unswervingly dictate the need for the socialist nations to continue to
            draw closer together in every way, to increase their cooperation, and to expand the socialist division of labor among themselves. The obliteration
            of class barriers and the development of socialist social relations strengthen social homogeneity among nations, promote the development of features
            common to all of them, and contribute to the further consolidation of mutual trust and friendship. However, the obliteration of national traits is a
            prolonged process. In socialist society, when there is a correct class line in national policy, national differences do not lead to estrangement
            between peoples. When national problems and contradictions arise, they do not have an antagonistic quality and can be solved in a spint of fraternal
            cooperation in the interests of the country as a whole and of each republic and in the interests of socialist and communist construction.</p>
                        <p>
                            <name type="institution" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union">The CPSU</name> and the other fraternal parties in
            the socialist countries reject both the exaggeration and the dismissal of national characteristics. They consistently put into practice the
            principles of internationalism and resolutely combat survivals of nationalism, chauvinism, national particularism, and national nihilism, and they
            seek to promote the further cohesion of the fraternal peoples.</p>

                        theoretically systematizes objective knowledge of reality, one of
                        the forms of social consciousness.</gloss>In the course of historical
                        development science becomes a productive force in society and
                        a highly important social institution. The concept of science
                        includes both activity aimed at gaining new knowledge and the
                        result of such activity - the sum of the scientific knowledge acquired
                         up to a given time, which constitutes the scientific conception
                         of the world. The term <q>'science"</q> is also used to designate
                         the various branches of scientific knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The immediate goals of science are to describe, explain, and
                        predict processes and phenomena of reality employing the laws
                        that science has discovered. In the broad sense, science aims at
                        the theoretical representation of reality.</p>

                        Inseparable
                        from the practical way of comprehending the world, science as
                        the creation of knowledge is a specific form of activity that differs
                        significantly both from physical production and from other types
                        of mental activity. Whereas in physical production knowledge is
                        used only as an ideal means, in science the acquisition of knowledge
                        constitutes the primary and direct goal, regardless of the
                        form that the goal takes - whether the goal be a theoretical
                        description, the flow charts of an industrial process, a summary
                        of experimental data, or the formula of a preparation. Unlike
                        those types of endeavor whose result is known in advance, before
                        the activity begins, scientific work is scientific because it creates
                        new knowledge - its result is fundamentally nontraditional. It is
                        precisely for this reason that science acts as a force that continually
                        revolutionizes other types of activity.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to the aesthetic (artistic) way of comprehending
                        reality, as embodied in art, science strives for impersonal, objective
                        knowledge that is generalized to the fullest possible extent,
                        in art the results of artistic cognition are inseparable from the
                        unique personal element. Art is often described as <q>"thinking in
                        images"</q> and science as <q>"thinking in concepts"</q>, emphasizing that
                        the former develops chiefly the sensory and imaginal aspect of
                        man's creative capacity, whereas the latter deals primarily with
                        the intellectual and conceptual aspect. These differences, however,
                        do not constitute an insurmountable barrier between
                        science and art, which are linked by their creative and cognitive
                        attitude toward reality. On the one hand, the aesthetic element
                        often plays a significant role in scientific constructs, especially in
                        the development of a theory, in a mathematical formula, or in
                        the plan or idea for an experiment. The presence of the aesthetic
                        element has been noted by many scientists. On the other hand,
                        artistic works have a cognitive, as well as an aesthetic aspect. For
                        example, K Marx' first insight into the socioeconomic nature of
                        money in bourgeois society was based, in particular, on an analysis
                        of the works of Goethe and Shakespeare (<bibl>

                        <p>The relationship between science and philosophy as specific
                        forms of social consciousness is complex. To some extent
                        philosophy always provides science with a methodology of cognition
                        and interprets its discoveries in terms of a world view.
                        Philosophy and science are also linked by a common striving to
                        present knowledge in a theoretical form and by a desire for
                        logical proof. This striving reaches its highest fulfillment in dialectical
                        materialism - a philosophy that consciously and openly
                        allies itself with science and with the scientific method. Dialectical
                        materialism studies the most general laws of the development
                        of nature, society, and thought, relying on the findings of science.</p>
                        <p>Because of the direct relation between philosophy and Weltanshauung,
                        in a society of antagonistic classes various philosophical
                        schools relate differently to science and to the methods that
                        it uses to arrive at knowledge. Some philosophical schools view
                        science skeptically (for example, existentialism) or even with
                        open hostility, whereas others attempt to dissolve philosophy in
                        science (positivism) thereby disregarding philosophy's function
                        in shaping a world view. Only Marxism-Leninism gives a consistent
                        solution to the problem of the relationship between
                        philosophy and science. It adopts scientific methods and makes
                        full use of scientific discoveries, at the same time taking into
                        account the specific nature of the subject matter under study and
                        the social role of philosophy. This makes Marxism-Leninism a
                        truly scientific philosophy. Through philosophy and the general
                        theory of the social sciences, all science is related to ideology and
                        politics. Whenever class antagonisms are present this relationship
                        accounts for the class character and 
                        <foreign xml:lang="ru">

                        of the social sciences, which border on philosophy, and
                        for the important role of the natural sciences in shaping a world
                        view.</p>
                        <p>Science, which is oriented toward the criteria of reason, has
                        been the antithesis of religion, which rests on faith in the super-<pb n="669" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0669"/>
                        natural. Whereas science studies reality by means of reality itself
                        and requires rational substantiation and practical confirmation
                        of the knowledge derived, religion sees its main strength in revelation
                        and in appeals to suprarational arguments and to the
                        indisputable authority of canonical texts. In the modern world,
                        however, religion has had to contend with the tremendous progress
                        in science and the growth of its social role, and therefore
                        it is vainly trying to find some way of reconciling its doctrine
                        with scientific truths or even of adapting them to its own needs.</p>

                        <p>Initially, knowledge was practical, serving as a methodological
                        guide to specific kinds of human activity. A great deal of
                        knowledge of this type, constituting an important prerequisite
                        for future science, was gathered in the ancient East (Babylonia,
                        Egypt, India, China). Mythology, the first attempt to create an
                        integrated, all-embracing system of concepts about surrounding
                        reality, may be regarded as a remote prerequisite for science.
                        These concepts were, however, far removed from science because
                        of their religious and anthropomorphic character. Moreover, the
                        criticism and destruction of mythological systems were preconditions
                        for the emergence of science. Certain social conditions
                        were also necessary for the rise of science - a sufficiently high
                        level of development of production and social relations (resulting
                        in the division of mental and physical labor and thereby making
                        possible systematic scientific work) and a rich and broad cultural
                        tradition permitting free assimilation of the achievements of different
                        cultures and peoples.</p>
                        <p>These conditions had emerged by the sixth century B C in
                        ancient Greece, where the first theoretical systems explaining
                        reality in terms of natural principles (unlike mythology) were
                        proposed by Thales, Democritus, and other thinkers. Having
                        detached itself from mythology, nature philosophy at first syncretically
                        combined science and the most speculative variants of
                        philosophy. Nonetheless, this nature philosophy represented
                        theoretical knowledge in which objectivity and logical persuasiveness
                        were primary. Ancient Greek science, as represented by
                        Aristotle and other thinkers, offered the first descriptions of the
                        laws of nature, society, and thought, which, although imperfect,
                        played a major role in the history of culture. These descriptions
                        of laws introduced into cognitive activity a system of abstract
                        concepts pertaining to the world as a whole. They firmly established
                        the tradition of searching for objective, natural laws of the
                        universe and laid the groundwork for the demonstrative method
                        of presenting material, the most important aspect of science. At
                        this time various branches of knowledge began to detach themselves
                        from nature philosophy. The Hellenistic period of ancient
                        Greek science saw the creation of the first theoretical systems in
                        geometry (Euclid), mechanics (Archimedes), and astronomy
                        (Ptolemy).</p>
                        <p>During the Middle Ages scholars of the Arab East and Middle
                        Asia, notably Avicenna, Averroes, and al Birum, made an important
                         contribution to the development of science by preserving
                        the ancient Greek tradition and enriching it in a number of fields.
                        In Europe the classical tradition was greatly transformed under
                        the domination of the Christian religion, which shaped the characteristic
                        medieval form of science - Scholasticism. Subordinate
                        to religion, Scholasticism dealt primarily with the elaboration of
                        Christian dogma, nevertheless, it made a significant contribution
                        to the development of thought and to the art of theoretical
                        debate. The development of alchemy and astrology also helped
                        lay the foundation for science in the modern sense alchemy
                        established the tradition of the experimental study of natural
                        substances and compounds, thus paving the way for chemistry,
                        and astrology stimulated systematic observation of celestial bodies,
                        thereby promoting the development of an experiential base
                        for astronomy.</p>
                        <p>Science in the modern sense emerged in the 16th and 17th
                        centuries to meet the needs of developing capitalist production.
                        Apart from past traditions, two circumstances contributed to the
                        rise of science. First, the domination of religious thought was
                        undermined during the Renaissance, and the opposing conception
                         of the world that evolved rested on scientific data. Science
                        became an independent factor in intellectual life and the basis for
                        a world view (Leonardo da Vinci, N Copernicus). Second, in
                        addition to observation, modern science introduced experimentation,
                        which became the basic method of research and greatly
                        expanded the scope of knowable reality by combining theoretical
                        reasoning with a practical <q>"testing"</q> of nature. As a result, the
                        cognitive capacity of science increased sharply. This profound
                        transformation of science in the 16th and 17th centuries was the
                        first scientific revolution, dominated by such figures as Galileo,
                        J Kepler, W Harvey, R Descartes, C Huygens, and I Newton.</p>
                        <p>As the pace of scientific progress quickened and as science
                        assumed the dominant position in the emerging new conception
                        of the world, scientific knowledge became a higher cultural value
                        toward which most philosophical schools and movements oriented
                        themselves. In the study of social phenomena, this reorientation
                        was manifested in a search for the <q>"natural principles"</q> of
                        religion, law, and morality, based on the concept of <q>"human
                        nature"</q> (H Grotius, B Spinoza, T Hobbes, J Locke). As the
                        bearer of the <q>"light of reason"</q>, science was regarded as the sole
                        antithesis of all the evils of society, whose transformation would
                        be possible only through enlightenment <cit>

                        <p>The advances in mechanics, whose basic principles had been
                        systematized and fully developed by the end of the 17th century,
                        played a decisive role in the emergence of the mechanistic conception
                        of the world, which soon became a universal world view
                        (L Euler, M V Lomonosov, P Laplace) Not only physical
                        and chemical phenomena, but also biological phenomena were
                        perceived mechanistically, for example, the view of man as an
                        integral organism (<bibl>

                            </bibl>) The ideals
                        of mechanistic natural science became the basis for a theory of
                        knowledge and for the study of scientific methods, which developed
                        rapidly in this period. Philosophical doctrines concerning
                        human nature, society, and the state arose in the 17th and 18th
                        centuries as branches of the general doctrine of a unified world
                        mechanism.</p>
                        <p>The reliance of modern science on experiments and the development
                        of mechanics permitted the establishment of a link between
                        science and production, although this link became
                        permanent and systematic only in the late 19th century.</p>
                        <p>By the early 19th century a large body of material pertaining
                        to various aspects of reality had been amassed, systematized, and
                        theoretically substantiated on the basis of the mechanistic world
                        view. It became increasingly apparent, however, that this
                        material did not fit within the framework of a mechanistic explanation
                        of nature and society and required a new, more profound,
                        and broader synthesis that would encompass the results obtained
                        by different sciences. The discovery of the law of the conservation
                        and conversion of energy by R Mayer, J Joule, and
                        H Helmholtz made it possible to place chemistry and all
                        branches of physics on a common ground. The cell theory, developed
                         by T Schwann and M Schleiden, demonstrated the uniform
                        structure of all living organisms. Darwin's evolutionary
                        theory in biology introduced the idea of development into natural
                         science. The periodic table of the elements worked out by
                        D I Mendeleev proved the existence of an intrinsic relation
                        between all known types of matter. In the mid-19th century the
                        socioeconomic, philosophical, and general scientific foundations
                        were laid for a scientific theory of social development, which was
                        created by the founders of Marxism. Marx and Engels revolutionized
                        the social sciences and philosophy, making it possible to
                        create a methodological base for a group of sciences dealing with
                        society. A new stage in the history of social science began with
                        V I Lenin, who developed all aspects of Marxism in a new
                        historical era.</p>
                        <p>Major changes in scientific thought and a number of new

                        precipitated a crisis in modern classical science at the turn of the
                        century and caused the collapse of its philosophical and methodological
                        foundation - the mechanistic world view. The essence
                        of this crisis was revealed by <bibl>
                                <author>Lenin</author> in his
                        <title>

                            </bibl>.
                        The crisis was resolved by another scientific revolution
                        , which began in physics (M Planck, A Einstein) and
                        subsequently encompassed all the main branches of science.</p>
                        <p>The convergence of science and production in the latter half
                        of the 19th century stimulated collaborative scientific work, requiring
                        new organizational forms. Twentieth-century science is
                        closely bound up with technology, is increasingly becoming a
                        direct productive force in society, is expanding its contact with
                        all spheres of social life, and is assuming a greater social role.
                        Contemporary science is the most important component, the
                        moving force, of the scientific and technological revolution. The
                        <q>"points of growth"</q> of 20th-century science have generally occurred
                        when the internal logic of its development has coincided
                        with the increasingly diverse social requirements imposed by
                        modern society. By the mid-20th century, biology occupied a
                        prominent position in natural science owing to such fundamental
                        discoveries as the molecular structure of DNA (F Crick and
                        J Watson) and the genetic code. An especially rapid rate of
                        development may be seen in those scientific trends that, by integrating
                        the achievements of various scientific branches, open up
                        new prospects for the solution of major contemporary problems,
                        such as the development of new energy sources and materials,
                        the improvement of man's relation to nature, the control of large
                        systems, and space research.</p>

                        trends. As early as 1844, Engels formulated a thesis concerning
                        the accelerated growth of science <cit>
                                <quote>"Science advances in proportion

                            </cit>.
                        As contemporary research has demonstrated, this thesis can be expressed
                        in the form of an exponential law characterizing the
                        growth of certain parameters of science beginning in the 17th
                        century. The amount of scientific activity doubles approximately
                        every ten to 15 years, and this is reflected in the increasingly
                        rapid growth in the number of scientific discoveries and the
                        quantity of scientific data, as well as in the number of persons
                        employed in science. According to data compiled by UNESCO,
                        between the 1920's and the early 1970's, the number of scientific
                        workers increased by 7 percent annually, whereas the population
                        as a whole increased by only 17 percent annually (In the 1970's
                        the growth indicators of science in the United States and certain
                        other capitalist countries began to decrease, reflecting the <q>"saturation"</q>
                        of science). Consequently, the current number of scientists
                        and scientific personnel is more than 90 percent of the total
                        number of scientists in the entire history of science.</p>
                        <p>The development of science is cumulative at each historical
                        stage science sums up its past achievements. Every scientific
                        discovery becomes an integral part of the entire body of scientific
                        knowledge, it is not nullified by subsequent advances in knowledge
                        but only reinterpreted and refined. The continuity of
                        science assures its development in a unified, irreversible manner.
                        Because of its continuity, science also serves as a kind of <q>"social
                        memory"</q> of mankind that crystallizes in theoretical form man's
                        past experience in understanding reality and mastering its laws.</p>
                        <p>Scientific development is reflected not only in the increasing
                        accumulation of knowledge. It also affects the entire structure of
                        science. At each historical stage scientific knowledge employs a
                        set of cognitive forms - fundamental categories and concepts,
                        methods, principles, and schemes - which constitute the mode of
                        thought. For example, observation as the basic method of obtaining
                        knowledge is characteristic of the classical mode of thought,
                        modern science relies on experimentation and on an essentially
                        analytical approach, which directs thought to the simplest, indivisible
                        elements of the reality under investigation, and contemporary
                        science strives for an integral and multifaceted
                        understanding of the objects under study. Once established, each
                        specific structure of scientific thought opens the way for an
                        extensive development of knowledge - for the application of
                        knowledge to new spheres of reality. However, the accumulation
                        of new material that cannot be explained on the basis of existing
                        schemes necessitates a search for new, intensive ways of developing
                        science. From time to time this results in a scientific revolution
                         - a radical change in the primary components of the content
                        structure of science - and in the introduction of new principles
                        of cognition and new scientific categories and methods. The
                        alternation of extensive and revolutionary periods of development,
                        characteristic both of science as a whole and of its various
                        branches, is eventually reflected in corresponding changes in the
                        organizational forms of science.</p>
                        <p>The entire history of science shows a complex dialectical interplay
                         of differentiation and integration mastery of a growing
                        number of new spheres of reality and a deepening of knowledge
                        lead to the differentiation of science and to its division into evermore
                         specialized fields. At the same time, the need to synthesize
                        knowledge is constantly expressed in the trend toward the integration
                         of the sciences. Initially new branches of science arose to
                        deal with particular subjects of inquiry as new spheres and aspects
                        of reality were drawn into the process of cognition. Contemporary
                        science is increasingly shifting from a subject to a
                        problem orientation, in which new fields of knowledge arise to
                        resolve a major theoretical or practical problem. Many interdisciplinary
                        sciences, such as biophysics, have arisen in this manner.
                        The appearance of these sciences attests to the ongoing
                        process of differentiation, but they also represent a starting point
                        for integrating hitherto distinct disciplines.</p>
                        <p>Important integrative functions in certain branches of science
                        are performed by philosophy, which gives a general outline of the
                        scientific conception of the world, and by such individual disciplines
                        as mathematics, logic, and cybernetics, which provide
                        science with a system of uniform methods.</p>

                        The disciplines that together constitute
                        the system of science may be subdivided into three major groups
                        (subsystems) - the natural, social, and engineering sciences,
                        which differ in their subject matter and method. There is no
                        well-defined boundary between these subsystems, and a number
                        of scientific disciplines occupy an intermediate position. For
                        example, industrial aesthetics brings together the engineering
                        and social sciences, bionics integrates the natural and engineering
                        sciences, and economic geography combines the natural and
                        social sciences. Each of these subsystems in turn consists of a
                        system of individual sciences that are coordinated and subordinated
                        in various ways according to subject matter and method.
                        The extremely complex problem of detailed classification has not
                        yet been resolved (<hi rend="italic">see below</hi> Classification of sciences).</p>
                        <p>In addition to traditional research, conducted within the
                        framework of a single branch of science, the problem-oriented
                        character of contemporary science has stimulated extensive interdisciplinary
                        and comprehensive research that draws upon several
                        different disciplines whose combination is determined by the
                        nature of the problem. An example of such research is the study
                        of the conservation of nature, which integrates the applied
                        sciences, biology, earth science, medicine, economics mathematics,
                        and other fields. Such studies, arising in connection with
                        the fulfillment of major economic and social tasks, are typical of
                        contemporary science.</p>
                        <p>The various sciences are generally classified as fundamental or
                        applied depending on their orientation and their relation to practical
                        activity. The fundamental sciences aim at gaining knowledge
                        of the laws that govern the behavior and interaction of the
                        basic structures of nature, society, and thought. These laws and
                        structures are studied in <q>"pure form"</q>, regardless of possible
                        application. The fundamental sciences are therefore sometimes
                        called the pure sciences. The goal of the applied sciences is to
                        employ the results of the fundamental sciences to solve not only
                        cognitive but also practical social problems. Here, not only the
                        attainment of truth but also the satisfaction of social needs serves
                        as the criterion of success. A special branch of research is developing
                        at the interface between the applied sciences and practice
                        in which the results obtained by the applied sciences are converted
                        into technological processes, designs, industrial materials,
                        and so forth.</p>
                        <p>The applied sciences may emphasize either theoretical or
                        practical problems. For example, electrodynamics and quantum
                        mechanics play a fundamental role in contemporary physics,<pb n="671" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0671"/>
                        when applied to specific fields of inquiry they form such branches
                        of theoretical applied physics as the physics of metals and semiconductor
                        physics. The practical application of electrodynamics
                        and quantum mechanics gives rise to such practical applied
                        sciences as physical metallurgy and semiconductor technology,
                        which are directly linked with production through specific research
                        projects. All the engineenng sciences are applied sciences.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental sciences generally outstrip the applied
                        sciences, providing them with a theoretical reserve. In contemporary
                        science the applied sciences account for as much as 80-90
                        percent of all research and appropriations. One of the major
                        problems in organizing science today is that of establishing
                        strong, planned links between the fundamental and applied
                        sciences and of reducing the time necessary to complete the cycle
                        <q>"fundamental research-applied research development introduction"</q>.</p>
                        <p>A distinction may be drawn between empirical and theoretical
                        levels in research and in the organization of knowledge. Facts,
                        which are obtained through observation and experimentation
                        and which define the qualitative and quantitative characteristics
                        of objects and phenomena, constitute empirical knowledge.
                        Recurrence and the connections between empirical characteristics
                        are expressed through empirical laws that are often probabilistic.
                        The theoretical level of scientific knowledge presupposes
                        the existence of abstract objects (constructs) and of theoretical
                        laws expressing the relations between them, theoretical laws are
                        formulated in order to provide an idealized description and explanation
                        of empirical conditions - to understand the essence of
                        phenomena. Theoretical constructs can be studied without resorting
                         to sensory expenence, but such study presupposes the
                        possibility of moving to sensory experience by explaining existing
                        facts and predicting new ones. The existence of a theory
                        explaining in a unified manner the facts that fall within its purview
                        is a criterion for scientific knowledge. A theoretical explanation
                        may be qualitative or, making extensive use of
                        mathematical apparatus, it may be quantitative, quantitative explanations
                        are especially charactenstic of contemporary natural
                        science.</p>
                        <p>The development of a theoretical level brings about a qualitative
                        change in the empirical level. Prior to the elaboration of a
                        theory, the empirical material serving as the theory's prerequisite
                        is obtained through everyday expenence and is described in
                        everyday language, but when the empirical material attains the
                        theoretical level it is <q>"seen"</q> through the prism of theoretical
                        concepts, which begin to direct experimentation and observation
                        - the principal methods of empirical investigation. At the empirical
                         level, such methods as comparison, measurement, induction,
                        deduction, analysis, and synthesis are used extensively.
                        Such cognitive methods as hypothesis, modeling, idealization,
                        abstraction, generalization, and mental expenmentation are
                        characteristic of the theoretical level.</p>
                        <p>All theoretical disciplines have their roots in practical expenence.
                        As the various sciences develop however, they break away
                        from their empirical base and develop in a strictly theoretical
                        manner (for example, mathematics), reverting to experience only
                        in practical applications.</p>
                        <p>The development of the scientific method was long the preserve
                        of philosophy, which even today continues to play a leading
                        role in working out methodological problems and which
                        serves as a general methodology of science. In the 20th century,
                        methodological means have become much more differentiated
                        and are often worked out by science itself - for example, new
                        categories (such as information) and specific methodological
                        principles (correspondence principle) have been introduced
                        through scientific development. Such branches of contemporary
                        science as mathematics and cybernetics, as well as specially developed
                        methodological approaches (for example, the systems
                        approach), play an important methodological role. As a result,
                        the relations between science and methodology have become
                        highly complex, and the elaboration of methodological problems
                        is assuming an increasingly important place within modern research.</p>

                            </hi> Science became a social institution in the 17th and
                        early 18th centimes, when the first learned societies and academies
                        were founded in Europe and the publication of scientific
                        journals began. Earlier, science as an independent social institution
                        was preserved and developed informally by traditions transmitted
                        through books, instruction, correspondence and personal
                        contact between scientists.</p>
                        <p>Science remained <q>"small-scale"</q> until the late 19th century,
                        employing relatively few people. At the turn of the century a new
                        method of organizing science arose large scientific institutes and
                        laboratories, with extensive technical facilities, were founded,
                        bringing scientific activity closer to the forms of modern industrial
                        labor. <q>"Small-scale"</q> science was thus transformed into
                        <q>"large-scale"</q> science. Contemporary science is becoming more
                        deeply involved with all other social institutions, permeating not
                        only industrial and agricultural production but also politics and
                        the administrative and military fields. As a social institution
                        science is in turn becoming the most important element in socioeconomic
                        potential, requiring growing expenditures, this has
                        made scientific policy one of the leading branches of social management.</p>
                        <p>With the division of the world into two camps after the Great
                        October Socialist Revolution, science as a social institution developed
                        under fundamentally different social conditions. Under
                        capitalism, where antagonistic class relations prevail, scientific
                        achievements are used largely by monopolies to make superprofits
                        to intensify the exploitation of workers, and to militarize
                        the economy. Under socialism, scientific development is planned
                        on a national scale in the interests of all the people. Economic
                        development according to plan and the transformation of social
                        relations are earned out scientifically, and science therefore
                        plays a decisive role both in creating the material and technical
                        base of communism and in shaping the new man. A developed
                        socialist society creates unlimited opportunities for scientific advancement
                        in the interests of the workers.</p>
                        <p>The rise of <q>"large"</q> science resulted primarily from a change
                        in the relation of science to technology and production. Science
                        was subordinate to production until the late 19th century, when
                        it began to outstrip technology and production. The unified
                        <q>"science-technology-production"</q> system emerged, in which
                        science was the dominant element. Since the onset of the scientific
                        and technological revolution science has been transforming
                        the structure and content of material activity <cit>

                        <p>In addition to the natural and engineering sciences, the social
                        sciences are becoming increasingly important in modern society.
                        They study man in all his diversity and provide guideposts for
                        social development. There has been a growing convergence of
                        the natural, engineering, and social sciences.</p>
                        <p>In contemporary science, problems of organizing and directing
                         scientific development have become vitally important. The
                        concentration and centralization of science have stimulated the
                        founding of national and international scientific organizations
                        and centers and the systematic undertaking of large-scale international
                         projects. Governments have created special agencies for
                        the direction of scientific activity, and the scientific policies formulated
                        through these agencies assure the development of
                        science in a goal oriented manner. Initially scientific research
                        was associated almost exclusively with universities and other
                        higher educational institutions and was organized according to
                        branch of science. In the 20th century there has been a proliferation
                        of specialized research institutions. The declining rate of
                        return from expenditures on scientific activity, especially in fundamental
                        research, has stimulated a search for new forms of
                        scientific organization. Among such new forms are scientific
                        centers for research in particular branches of science (such as the
                        Pushchino Center for Biological Research of the Academy of
                        Sciences of the USSR in Moscow Oblast) and comprehensive
                        scientific centers (Novosibirsk Scientific Center). Research subdivisions
                        have been established to study vanous problems. To
                        solve specific scientific problems, often of an interdisciplinary
                        nature, special groups, comprising problem-oriented teams, have
                        been created to carry out projects and programs, for example,
                        the space program. Centralization in the supervision of scientific<pb n="672" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0672"/>
                        activity is increasingly being combined with decentralization and
                        autonomy in research. Informal problem-oriented groups of
                        scientists - <q>"invisible groups"</q> - are frequently formed. In addition,
                        informal scientific trends and schools, which arose in the
                        period of <q>"small scale"</q> science, continue to exist and develop
                        within the framework of <q>"large-scale"</q> science.</p>
                        <p>Scientific methods in turn are being employed more extensively
                        in the organization and direction of other fields. The scientific
                        organization of labor is becoming one of the chief means of
                        increasing the efficiency of social production. Automatic production
                        control systems, designed with the aid of computers and
                        cybernetics, are being introduced. Increasingly, the human factor
                        is becoming the focus of scientific management, particularly
                        in man-machine systems. The results of scientific research are
                        used to improve management principles for groups, enterprises,
                        the state, and society as a whole. Like any social application of
                        science, such use of scientific research serves different ends under
                        capitalism and socialism.</p>
                        <p>National characteristics, important in the development of
                        science, are reflected in the distribution of scientific personnel,
                        in the national and cultural traditions influencing research in
                        particular fields within the framework of scientific schools and
                        trends, in the relationship between fundamental and applied
                        research on a national scale, and in government policy toward
                        scientific development, which determines, for example, the
                        amount and purpose of appropnations. However, the results of
                        science - scientific knowledge - are essentially international.</p>
                        <p>The development of science as a social institution is closely
                        associated with the education and training of scientific personnel.
                        The present scientific and technological revolution has
                        opened a gap between the historically established tradition of
                        secondary and higher education and the needs of society (including
                        science). New methods of instruction employing the latest
                        achievements in psychology, pedagogy, and cybernetics are being
                        rapidly introduced to close the gap, and instruction in higher
                        schools has tended to draw closer to research practices in science
                        and production.</p>
                        <p>In education the cognitive function of science is closely linked
                        to the task of bringing up students to become full-fledged members
                        of society and inculcating values and moral traits.</p>
                        <p>The experience of social life and Marxist-Leninist theory have
                        proved conclusively that the ideal of the Enlightenment was
                        Utopian and erroneous, according to this ideal the universal
                        dissemination of scientific knowledge would automatically produce
                        morally superior individuals and a just organization of
                        society. This goal can be achieved only through a fundamental
                        change in the social structure, through the replacement of capitalism
                        by socialism.</p>
                        <p>Truth, which itself is morally and ethically neutral, is the
                        highest value for science as a system of knowledge. Moral judgments
                        may apply either to activity aimed at gaining knowledge
                        (the scientist's professional ethics require intellectual integrity
                        and courage in his never-ending search for truth) or to the application
                        of scientific discoveries (here the problem of the relationship
                        between science and morality takes the form of
                        scientists' moral responsibility for the social consequences of
                        their discoveries) The barbaric use of science by militarists (the
                        Nazis' experiments on human beings, Hiroshima and Nagasaki)
                        has provoked vigorous social actions by progressive scientists,
                        for example, the Pugwash conferences, aimed at preventing the
                        inhumane application of science.</p>
                        <p>Various aspects of science are studied by a number of specialized
                        branches, including the history of science, the logic of
                        science, the sociology of science, and the psychology of scientific
                        creativity. A new, comprehensive approach to the study of
                        science that strives for a synthesis of its numerous aspects - the
                        science of science - has developed rapidly since the mid-20th
                        century.</p>

                        classes, the complexities and contradictions associated with the
                        growing importance of science give rise to diverse and frequently
                        contradictory evaluations of science. Scientism and antiscientism
                        represent the two extremes of such evaluations. Scientism converts
                        into absolutes the mode of thought and general methods of
                        the exact sciences and declares science to be the supreme cultural
                        value, frequently rejecting humanitarian and philosophical problems
                        on the grounds that they have no cognitive significance. In
                        contrast, antiscientism proceeds from the assumption that
                        science is fundamentally inadequate for solving basic human
                        problems. In its extreme forms this view regards science as hostile
                         to man and denies that it exerts a positive influence on
                         culture.</p>
                        <p>Unlike scientism and antiscientism, the Marxist-Leninist
                        world view integrates the objective scientific approach with a
                        viable humanistic orientation. It reveals the means for transforming
                         natural and social reality through science, taking into
                        account the significance of other ways of apprehending the world
                        (which constitute the conditions and prerequisites for science)
                        and combining them in the interest of man.</p>
                        <p>Bourgeois and Marxist views on the future of science also
                        differ radically. Bourgeois ideas stem from an absolutization of
                        certain aspects of modern science, which are uncritically projected
                        into the future in an unaltered or hypertrophic form.
                        Scientism holds that science will be the only sphere of intellectual
                        culture in the future and will absorb the <q>"irrational"</q> aspect
                        of culture. Antiscientism, on the other hand, condemns science
                        either to extinction or to perpetual opposition to the essence of
                        man, conceived in anthropological terms. The Marxist-Leninist
                        outlook considers contemporary science as a historically conditioned
                         method of producing and organizing knowledge. It holds
                        that in the future science will erase the boundaries separating its
                        various branches, will be further enriched by methodological
                        elements, and will converge with other ways of apprehending the
                        world intellectually. These trends will create the conditions
                        necessary for the emergence of a new, unified science of the
                        future, oriented toward man and his universal creative ability to
                        apprehend and transform reality <cit>

                        Classification of the sciences
                        consists in the disclosure of the connections between the sciences
                        on the basis of certain principles these connections are expressed
                        in terms of a logically valid grouping, or sequence, of sciences.
                        In addition to the principles of classification, graphic, including
                        tabular, methods of representation also play a major role.</p>
                        <p>CLASSIFICATION PRINCIPLES The connections between the
                        sciences are determined by the objects that the sciences study
                        and by the objective relations between various aspects of the
                        objects, by the methods and conditions for obtaining knowledge
                        about the objects, and by the goals that stimulate and are served
                        by scientific knowledge. From the epistemological standpoint,
                        the principles used in classifying the sciences are divided into
                        objective and subjective ones. Principles are objective when the
                        connection is derived from a relation between the objects themselves,
                        and they are subjective when classification is based on
                        characteristics of the subject. From the methodological standpoint,
                        the principles of classification are divided according to
                        how the connection between the sciences is interpreted. The
                        connection is external when the sciences are merely arranged in
                        a certain order, and it is internal, or organic, when the sciences
                        are derived or developed from one another. In the first instance
                        the operative principle is coordination, and the schema is
                        A  B C, and so forth. In the second instance the principle is that
                        of subordination, and the pattern is A B C, and so on
                        (The letters represent the different sciences, the vertical lines,
                        sharp breaks between sciences, and the ellipses, transitions between
                        sciences).</p>
                        <p>From the standpoint of logic, classification is based on different
                         aspects of a general link between the sciences, these aspects
                        represent the initial and terminal points of a main sequence of
                        sciences. Two principles for ordering the sciences are those of
                        decreasing generality (from the general to the particular) and of
                        increasing concreteness (from the abstract to the concrete). According
                        to the principle of subordination, the sciences are arranged
                        in order of development from the simple to the complex
                        and from the lower to the higher. Here attention is focused
                        primarily on the points of contact and interpenetration between
                        the sciences. There are also other ways of isolating different
                        aspects of a general link between the sciences and forming corresponding
                        principles - for example, from empirical description to
                        theoretical explanation or from theory to practice.</p>
                        <p>Classification by content considers the relations among
                        sciences as an expression or result of (1) the progression of
                        knowledge from a general law to its particular manifestation or
                        from general laws of development to particular laws of nature
                        and society, corresponding to the principle of classification based
                        on a consecutive transition from the general to the particular, (2)
                        the progression of knowledge from one aspect of an object to the
                        sum total of its aspects, corresponding to the principle of transition
                        from the abstract to the concrete, and (3) the reflection in
                        thought of the movement of an object from the simple to the
                        complex, from the inferior to the superior, corresponding to the
                        principle of development. The principle of development also
                        includes the progression of knowledge from the general to the
                        particular and from the abstract to the concrete. The dialectical
                        materialist principles that underlie the Marxist classification of
                        the sciences presuppose the indivisibility of the principle of objectivity
                        and the principle of development (or subordination).
                        There is an internal unity of the epistemological, methodological
                        (dialectical), and logical aspects of the general link between the
                        sciences</p>
                        <p>HISTORICAL SURVEY The central issue in the history of the
                        classification of sciences is the relationship between philosophy
                        and the various sciences. This history consists of three main
                        stages the undifferentiated philosophical science of antiquity
                        and, to some extent, of the Middle Ages, the differentiation of
                        the sciences between the 15th and 18th centunes, when knowledge
                        was analytically divided into separate fields, and the integration
                        of the sciences that began in the 19th century, when the
                        sciences were combined into a unified system of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>During the first of these stages the idea of classifying knowledge
                        originated in the countries of the ancient East, along with
                        the rudiments of scientific knowledge. The thought of the ancients,
                        notably Aristotle, contained the germ of all later principles
                        of classification, including the division of all knowledge into
                        three main fields according to the object studied nature (physics),
                        society (ethics), and thought (logic).</p>
                        <p>In the second stage philosophy split into such distinct sciences
                        as mathematics and mechanics. The prevailing analytical
                        method determined the general character of classification, based
                        on an external juxtaposition of the sciences. The subjective principle
                        of classification took into account such properties of the
                        human intellect as memory (history), imagination (poetry), and
                        reason (philosophy), which represented a considerable advance
                        beyond the theologians' and Scholastics' division of secular
                        knowledge into the "seven liberal arts". The subjective principle,
                        introduced by J. Huarte, was developed by F. Bacon, who divided
                         all knowledge into history, poetry, and philosophy.
                        T Hobbes, the systemizer of Bacon's doctrine, sought to combine
                        the subjective and objective principles, holding the mathematical
                        method to be universal and placing geometry at the
                        head of the deductive sciences and physics at the head of the
                        inductive. He tended to arrange the sciences on a continuum
                        from the abstract to the concrete, from the quantitative determination
                        of an object to its qualitative determination. Descartes
                        developed the objective principle of classification according to
                        aspects of the objects under study. The classical division of the
                        sciences into logic, physics, and ethics (P Gassendi) or physics,
                        practice, and logic (J Locke) was revived. In the 18th century
                        the objective principle was further developed by M V Lomonosov.
                        In contrast, the French Encyclopedists (D Diderot and
                        D'Alembert) essentially adopted Bacon's principles and schema.
                        The separation of knowledge into the three main branches of
                        nature, society, and thought gave way to finer subdivisions beginning
                        in the 18th century.</p>
                        <p>The transition to the third stage in the history of the classification
                        of sciences occurred during the first three quarters of the
                        19th century and consisted of two distinct trends. The first trend,
                        based on the general principle of coordination, ran counter to the
                        prevailing tendency of scientific development in the 19th century.
                        Two solutions to the problem of classification were
                        proposed within the first trend.</p>
                        <p>(1) The formal solution - based on the principle of coordination
                        from the general to the particular in order of decreasing
                        generality - was developed in France in the early and mid-19th
                        century Saint Simon proposed an objective principle of classification
                         according to a progression from simpler, more general
                        phenomena to more complex and particular phenomena. Adopting
                        Saint-Simon's system, A Comte systematized his ideas, although
                        he also exaggerated them. Comte identified six primary
                        (theoretical, abstract) sciences constituting an encyclopedic sequence,
                        or hierarchy, of the sciences mathematics, astronomy,
                        physics, chemistry, physiology, and sociology (The mechanics
                        of terrestrial bodies was included in mathematics and psychology
                        in physiology) Comte did not have a historical view of
                        nature, the historical element manifested itself only in man's
                        knowledge of nature. His system rested on the principle of coor-<pb n="674" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0674"/>
                        dination, and he assigned to sociology a separate place in his
                        hierarchy. Comte's classification was significant in that, first, he
                        identified the truly basic sciences corresponding (if mathematics
                        is disregarded) to the principal forms of the motion of matter in
                        nature and to the social form of motion (the subject of sociology).
                        Second in Comte's classification the basic sciences are placed in
                        a correct, albeit external, relation to one another in the sequence
                        in which they developed Comte's system, therefore, was a
                        prerequisite for classification based on the principle of subordination.</p>
                        <p>(2) The formal solution to the problem of classification employing
                        the principle of coordination from the abstract to the
                        concrete (in order of decreasing abstraction) was widely accepted
                        in Great Britain in the mid and late 19th century (S T
                        Coleridge, W Whewell, J Bentham). Criticizing Comte, J S
                        Mill and H Spencer advocated giving a place to psychology in
                        the hierarchy of the sciences. Spencer rejected Comte's premise
                        that every science has abstract and concrete parts, asserting that
                        all sciences are divided into the abstract (logic and mathematics),
                        the concrete (astronomy, geology biology, psychology, and sociology),
                        and those that are intermediate - the abstract-concrete
                        sciences (mechanics, physics, and chemistry). Although distinct
                        boundaries separate these three groups, gradual transitions occur
                         within them. Spencer applied the idea of evolution only to
                        the concrete sciences and he also denied that there was a logical
                        link between classification and the history of knowledge of the
                        world.</p>
                        <p>The second trend in the transition to the third stage in the
                        history of classification was the introduction of the principle of
                        subordination, in accordance with the idea of the development
                        and general link between natural phenomena. Here, too, there
                        were two different solutions.</p>
                        <p>(1) The principle of subordination was elaborated idealistically
                        as the principle of the development of the spint (but not of
                        nature) by I Kant, F W J von Schelling, and, especially,
                        G Hegel. Hegel proposed a triadic division, corresponding to
                        the general tendency of his philosophical system, which was
                        divided into logic the philosophy of nature and the philosophy
                        of the spirit. The philosophy of nature was further subdivided
                        into mechanism (mechanics, astronomy), chemism (physics,
                        chemistry), and organism (biology). For all its artificiality, this
                        system reflected, albeit in distorted form, the idea of the development
                        of nature from its lower to its higher levels, up to the
                        thinking spirit.</p>
                        <p>(2) The principle of subordination and an approach to the
                        theoretical synthesis of knowledge were developed from a
                        materialist standpoint in Russia. In order to bring about a synthesis
                         of the sciences in the mid-19th century, it was necessary
                        to bridge the gap between philosophy and the natural sciences
                        that had been created by the positivists (as A I Herzen attempted
                        to do) and to mend the breach between the natural
                        sciences and the humanities (N G Chernyshevsku). For
                        Herzen, historicism in understanding nature was organically
                        combined with historicism in comprehending the development
                        of knowledge of nature. Herzen's historicism provided a strong
                        methodological foundation for a synthesis of the sciences. The
                        same was true of Chernyshevsku, who, like V G Belinskii
                        before him, criticized the limitations of Comte's views.</p>
                        <p>In the late 19th century an idealist line, associated with the
                        incipient crisis in natural science, became apparent in the development
                        of non-Marxist systems of classification. For the most
                        part the general principle of coordination continued to be the
                        basis for classifying the sciences. In France, Comte's ideas gave
                        way to the Machist views of H Pomcare, E Gablot, and H A
                        Naville. Eclectic principles of classification were advanced by
                        E Duhring and W Wundt in Germany and by T G Masaryk
                        in Bohemia. Classifications were also elaborated from the standpoint
                        of neo Kantianism, which grew out of the rupture between
                        the sciences dealing with nature (whose phenomena were considered
                        to be lawlike) and the science of society, or history (whose
                        events were represented as a jumble of chance occurrences).
                        H Cohen and, to some extent, E Cassirer and P Natorp sought
                        to impose unity on diversity by using mathematically derived
                        concepts. Mathematics accordingly became the dominant
                        science. The Machists and energeticists based their classification
                        of the sciences on a rejection of the specific features of social
                        phenomena, regarding them as merely complex biopsychic
                        phenomena (R Avenanus, E Mach) or energetic biophysical
                        phenomena (W Ostwald). Some philosophers and scientists
                        adopted a formal approach to classification, singling out a particular
                        aspect of the general connection between the sciences (or
                        correspondingly between world phenomena) and making it the
                        principal, decisive aspect. An example of such an approach was
                        the geographic school, which held that the main connection was
                        the spatial relation between things and phenomena. The leading
                        representatives of this school were E Chizhov, I Mechnikov,
                        and L Berg in Russia and A Hettner and F Ratzel in Germany.</p>
                        <p>In Russia classifications based on coordination of the principles
                         of coordination were proposed by such philosophers as
                        M M Troitskn and N Ia Grot. In France and Switzerland
                        classification of the sciences was reflected in the writings of
                        E Meyerson and J Piaget, who has tried to develop a genetic
                        epistemology in contrast to the conventional, static view of human
                         knowledge. Piaget arrived at a cyclical scheme that takes
                         into account the transition from object to subject and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>With the spread of neopositivism, a classification of the
                        sciences on a logical positivist basis was worked out by P Oppenheim
                        in Germany, P Frank in Austria, G Bergmann in the
                        USA, and A J Ayer in Great Britain. The holists J C Smuts
                        and A Meyer-Abich tried to place life, or the spiritual aspect,
                        at the center of their classification of the sciences. The Swiss
                        spiritualist A Reymond proposed a formal and relativistic
                        scheme for classifying the sciences.</p>
                        <p>After World War II the influence of neo-Thomism and objective
                        idealism (N Hartmann) on the sciences, including classification,
                        increased significantly in the Western countries. Pope
                        Pius XII wrote of the three implements of truth - science,
                        philosophy, revelation - of which the third is the highest and to
                        which the first two must adapt. The neo-Thomists adhere to this
                        view, for example, E Gilson and his pupil M de Wulf, who has
                        constructed a three-level pyramid with the particular sciences at
                        the base, the general sciences, or philosophy, in the center, and
                        theology at the apex. Logical and mathematical-logical studies
                        on the structure of scientific knowledge, notably those of L von
                        Bertalanffy, are closely related to the problem of the classification
                        of sciences.</p>
                        <p>MARXIST CLASSIFICATION OF THE SCIENCES The third stage
                        in the history of the classification of the sciences was embodied
                        in the works of the founders of Marxism. Relying on the dialectical
                        materialist method that they had developed, Marx and Engels
                        overcame the limitations of the two previous extreme
                        concepts of classification - Hegel's idealism and Saint-Stmon's
                        metaphysical tendency - and critically revised the valuable aspects
                        of these concepts. As a result, new principles were developed
                        that organically combined two basic elements an objective
                        approach and the principle of subordination, or development.
                        The discovery of the basic laws of materialist dialectics laid the
                        foundation for a general theoretical synthesis of the sciences that
                        encompassed the three main fields of knowledge - nature, society,
                        and thought. This synthesis presupposed the solution of
                        two problems the relationship between philosophy and natural
                        science and between the natural and social sciences. The position
                        of the engineering sciences in the general system of knowledge
                        was defined as the connecting link between the natural and social
                        sciences. Engels' concept of <q>"form of motion"</q>, common to all
                        aspects of nature, included not only the different types of energy
                        found in inanimate nature but also life - the biological form of
                        motion. The sciences therefore naturally fall into the sequence
                        mechanics-physics-chemistry-biology. Engels showed that the
                        sequence of the forms of motion corresponds to the successive
                        stages of nature's development as a whole and of the history of
                        science. The coincidence of the historical and the logical in the
                        understanding of nature and in the development of nature itself
                        led to the solution of the methodological problems of classification
                        and to the division of the history of science into periods.</p>
                        <p>Further developing his system of classification, Engels took
                        into account the material bearers, or substrata, of different forms
                        of motion. His classification thus touched upon the theory of the
                        structure of matter (atomism). By determining the bearers of<pb n="675" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0675"/>
                        various forms of motion, Engels established a full correspondence
                         between the sequence of matter's increasingly complex
                        forms of motion and the general sequence of their bearers, which
                        are formed from each other through division of the initial
                        masses. However, the hypothetical assumption that <q>"ethereal
                        particles"</q> are earners of light and electrical phenomena violated
                        the harmony of the entire system, insofar as it was assumed that
                        because they were physical, these particles must arise through
                        the division of atoms into smaller particles. It thus turned out
                        that only molecular physics precedes chemistry in the general
                        sequence of the sciences and that the physics of <q>"ether"</q> follows
                        chemistry. In the 20th century this sequence was confirmed by
                        the emergence of subatomic (nuclear and quantum) physics.
                        Recognition of the division of the line of nature's development
                        chiefly into the inanimate and the animate introduced a complication
                        into Engels' classification.</p>
                        <p>The principles of Marxist dialectical logic worked out by
                        Lenin had a direct bearing on the task of classifying the sciences.
                        Especially important were Lenin's statements concerning the
                        necessity of preserving the unity of the historical and the logical,
                        of taking into account the bifurcation of the whole into contradictory
                         parts, transitions, and relations between phenomena, and
                        of understanding the relationship between theory and practice.
                        In the early years of Soviet power, most of the classifications
                        proposed adhered to some extent to the principles of conventional
                         formal classifications. A notable exception was K A
                        Timinazev's classification, which rested on a historical evolutionary
                        foundation and approached the Marxist interpretation.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It was only in 1925 that Engels' classification became known
                        through the publication of his Dialectics of Nature. However, the
                        first efforts to draw upon the ideas of Marx, Engels, and Lenin
                        in classification were often unsuccessful, since those who attempted
                        to incorporate these ideas actually took a mechanistic
                        position. V Rozhitsyn offered a classification of the sciences that
                        was strongly influenced by Hegelianism. Investigation of the
                        place of various sciences within the overall scientific system and
                        attempts to define the subject matter of the sciences contributed
                        to the solution of the problem of classifying the sciences as a
                        whole - for example, N N Semenov's study of the boundaries
                        between physics and chemistry employing Engels' definition of
                        these sciences. O Iu Shmidt attempted to apply Lenin's thesis
                        concerning the progression of knowledge from living contemplation
                        to abstract thought and from the latter to practice. Shmidt
                        gave special attention to the point of contact between natural
                        science and technology, showing that the boundary between
                        them is gradually being erased.</p>
                        <p>The general ideas of the Marxist classification of the sciences
                        were expounded by B Barkhash and S Turetskii. In many cases
                        Engels' classification was interpreted dogmatically and attempts
                        were made to retain his schema without taking into account the
                        changes that had taken place in science. Other works stressed the
                        need to change Engels' schema, especially the part that concerned
                        subatomic physics, while retaining and developing the
                        general dialectical materialist principles that he had worked out.
                        Some scholars, notably S G Strumilin, developed the idea of a
                        cyclical classification of the sciences. E I Mamurin, Z N Ambartsumian,
                        and O P Teslenko made an important contribution
                        to library bibliographical classification based on the Marxist
                        classification of the sciences.</p>
                        <p>The general classification of modern science rests on the relationship
                         between the three main branches of scientific knowledge,
                        natural science, the social sciences, and philosophy. Each
                        of the main branches represents an entire group of sciences. The
                        basis, or <q>"skeleton"</q>, of the general classification of science is
                        shown in Table 1. Here the boldface lines designate the primary
                        relations between the three main branches of science. Comparison
                        of the right-hand and left-hand parts of the table reveals the
                        essence of the principles of objectivity and development with
                        respect to classification. The positioning of the sciences in this
                        table directly reflects the historical sequence of the appearance
                        of and the correlation between the stages of the world's development,
                        as well as the correlation between the most general laws
                        of development (dialectics) and the particular laws of development
                        (the other sciences).</p>
                        <p>In addition to the three main branches of science, there are
                        major subdivisions that border on the main branches but are not
                        entirely included within any of them. Connections between these
                        subdivisions and the main branches are represented by secondary
                        (broken) lines. These subdivisions are the engineenng
                        sciences in the broad sense (including the agricultural and medical
                        sciences), which stand at the interface of the natural and the
                        social sciences, and mathematics, which stands at the interface
                        of natural science (primarily physics) and philosophy (primarily
                        logic) Psychology stands between the three main branches as an
                        independent science that studies man's psychology from the
                        standpoint of natural history and social development. Psychology
                        is even more closely related to logic, the science of
                        thought within philosophy. Tertiary relations are not depicted in
                        Table 1. For example, mathematical logic (for the most part a
                        mathematical discipline) stands between logic (part of philosophy)
                        and mathematics, and zoopsychology stands between the
                        physiology of higher nervous activity (within natural science)
                        and human psychology.</p>
                        <p>Occupying a special position are a group of sciences that form
                        the boundary between history (chiefly cultural history) and natural
                        science - the history of the natural sciences themselves. In as
                        much as they are simultaneously sociohistorical and natural

                        Engels called the social
                        sciences the history of man, since each social science is primarily
                        a historical science. Human history may be studied in two cross-sections
                         as the development of society as a whole (the interdependence
                         of all its aspects and elements) or as the development<pb n="676" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0676"/>
                        of one or several of its structural aspects in isolation. The first
                        of these approaches is represented by historical science in the
                        narrow sense of the word - the history of the various stages of
                        development of society from the primitive to the modern - and
                        also includes archaeology and ethnology. The second approach
                        gives rise to a group of social sciences that reflect the relation
                        between various aspects or elements of the internal structure of
                        society - the relation between its economic base and its political
                        and ideological superstructures. The objective sequence of the
                        transition from the base to an expanding superstructure determines
                        the arrangement of the sciences in this group. The transition
                        to philosophy in the course of the mental progression from
                        base to superstructure and from the political to the ideological
                        superstructure also represents a step beyond the social sciences
                        into the realm of general world-view problems associated with
                        the science of the most general laws of development and with the
                        science of thought (see Table 2, which is a detailed breakdown
                        of one part of Table 1).</p>

                        Fundamental
                        changes have taken place in natural science since the 19th
                        century. A new science - subatomic physics (quantum mechanics,
                        electron nuclear physics) - has emerged and radically altered
                        the relationship between physics and mechanics and between
                        physics and chemistry. Cybernetics which links many branches
                        of natural science, mathematics and technology, has developed,
                        and space exploration has influenced the development of a number
                        of sciences, especially astronomy. Many transitional and
                        intermediate sciences have appeared, making the science of nature
                        a system of interpenetrating and interwoven sciences in the
                        20th century.</p>

                        the main sectors of the national economy - industry (heavy and
                        light, processing and extracting, transport and communications),
                        agriculture (crop cultivation and animal husbandry), and
                        public health. The engineering sciences are linked to the social
                        sciences through these sectors of production and through the

                        <p>Nature's development can be analyzed not only in terms of
                        individual forms of the motion and types of matter, but also in
                        terms of nature as a whole, that is, it may be analyzed as the
                        interaction of all the forms of motion and types of matter that
                        coexist at any given stage of development. In this case the subject
                        matter of the natural sciences is the individual stages of nature's
                        development as part of the universe. Individual celestial bodies,
                        a system of such bodies, or even the universe as a whole (cosmology)
                        may be chosen as the area of study. This is the subject
                        of astronomy with its associated sciences of astrophysics, astrochemistry,
                        and astrobiology, which have been developed as a
                        result of man's breakthrough into space. A narrower field of
                        study is the earth as an individual body (planet), whose history
                        as a whole is the subject of geology and whose surface is the
                        subject of physical geography and the related sciences of phyto-<pb n="677" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol17.0677"/>
                        geography and zoogeography. A still narrower field is the earth's
                        biosphere, which constitutes the subject of biology and the
                        related science of biogeochemistry. Thus, still another sequence
                        of sciences is formed that essentially coincides with Table 3, if
                        astronomy is placed beside mechanics and physics and physical
                        geography is placed between geology and biology, astronomy-geology-geography

                        <p>PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CLASSIFICATION Classification
                        is the theoretical basis for many branches of practical activity.
                        It is used in organizing scientific institutions and determining the
                        relationship between them, in planning research projects, particularly
                        comprehensive ones, in coordinating the work of scientists
                        with different specializations, and in applying theoretical
                        research to practical tasks stemming from the requirements of
                        the national economy and from the demands of ideological,
                        political, and economic activity. Classification is important in
                        education, particularly in universities and in technical, agricultural,
                        medical and specialized liberal arts institutions, where it
                        is employed in integrating the theoretical and technical disciplines
                        and in determining the relationship between philosophy
                        and other disciplines. Classification is also used in writing comprehensive,
                        encyclopedic works (particularly in defining their
                        structure), in writing related teaching aids and manuals, in planning
                        general exhibitions and in organizing library science and
                        library classification. In library classification it is important to be
                        able to move from a branch or closed classification to a linear
                        one Table 4 offers an example of such a transition.</p>

                        the basic means by which people come to know and acquire
                        culture, and it is the foundation of culture's development.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>Education is acquired primarily through study in various educational
                        institutions. Self-education, cultural-enlightenment
                        work, and participation in social labor also play an essential role
                        in the acquisition of knowledge and in intellectual development.</p>
                    <p>The content and level of education are determined by the
                        requirements of social production, social relations, the level of
                        development of schooling and pedagogical science, and the state
                        of science, technology, and culture. In a class society education
                        reflects class history, as may be seen in the structure of public
                        education systems, the content of education, and the methods of
                        teaching. The class character of the bourgeois school system,
                        which is marked by restrictions on the level of education provided
                        for workers' children, by racial discrimination (in some
                        countries), and by a large proportion of private and parochial
                        schools, is in contrast to the Soviet system of public education.
                        which rests on a number of principles, including the equal availability
                         of education to all citizens of the USSR, compulsory education
                         for all children and adolescents, and the state and public
                        character of educational institutions. The Soviet educational system
                        is also distinguished from the bourgeois system by freedom
                        of choice of the language of study, the absence of tuition for ill
                        types of education, full state support for some students and a
                        system of stipends for others, the unification of the system of
                        public education, and continuity among all types of educational
                        institutions. In addition, the Soviet educational system rests on
                        the principles of the unity of education and communist upbringing;
                         cooperation among the school, the family, and the society
                        in bringing up children and young people; and the linking of
                        education and training to life and the practical experience nt
                        building communism. The underlying principles of the Soviet
                        system of public education also include a scientific approach to
                        and continual improvement of education on the basis of the latest
                        achievements in science, technology, and culture; a humanistic
                        and highly moral orientation in education and upbringing; and
                        coeducation. Furthermore, Soviet education is secular - that is,
                        it excludes the influence of religion.</p>
                    <p>A distinction is made between general and specialized education.
                         General education provides the knowledge and skills
                        needed by everyone, regardless of their future field and occupation.
                        Specialized education provides the knowledge and skill
                        needed by the worker in a specific field with specific qualifications.
                         In socialist countries the goals of general education are in
                        equip students with a totality of knowledge about the fundamental
                         principles of various disciplines, as well as with the corresponding
                        skills and habits needed for comprehensive personal
                        development; to train active, conscious builders of socialism and
                        communism; and to develop in them the communist world view
                        and communist morality. In the USSR and other socialist countries,
                         general education is inextricably linked with polytechnic
                        education. The transition to universal secondary education in the
                        USSR, under the conditions of a highly developed socialist society,
                         has had great social and national economic significance.
                        Universal secondary education is the foundation for the comprehensive
                         personal development of every member of society, the
                        guarantee of complete equality to all citizens in obtaining in
                        education, and the prerequisite for the mastery of any profession
                        at the level of contemporary achievements in science, technology,
                        and culture.</p>
                    <p>General education provides the foundation essential to specialized
                         education, which includes a number of fields (for example,
                         mining, radio engineering, construction, mathematics,
                        power engineering, agriculture, medicine, history, and
                        pedagogy). In the training of specialists, the study of specialized 
                        information is combined with the acquisition of an understanding
                         of the general scientific principles of modern production.
                        There are several levels of specialized education: higher, secondary
                         specialized, and vocational technical education. The last
                        category includes a brief period of direct, on-the-job training for
                        workers.</p>
                    <p>The organizational principles, basic goals, and plans for
                        improvement in all the links in the Soviet system of public education
                         are defined in the Basic Principles of Legislation on Public
                        Education of the USSR and the Union Republics (1973). The
                        Soviet educational system is responsible for providing the
                        national economy with trained personnel capable of organically
                        combining the achievements of the scientific and technologycal
                        revolution with the achievements of socialism, in order to meet
                        the tasks of communist construction. The secondary general
                        education schools, the vocational technical educational institutions,
                         and the secondary specialized educational institutions
                        have a number of tasks. They are responsible for providing the
                        younger generation with a general secondary education that
                        meets the modern requirements of social and scientific and technological
                         progress. Furthermore, they are assigned the task of
                        equipping students with a profound, solid knowledge of the fundamental
                        principles of various disciplines, as well as inculcating
                        in them a drive to continually improve their knowledge and an<pb n="75" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol18.075"/>
                        ability to supplement their knowledge independently and to apply
                        it in practice.</p>
                    <p>The scientific and technological revolution has caused an increase
                        in the rate of replacement of the means of production and
                        its technology, as well as a decrease in the time required for
                        putting new scientific discoveries into practice. Consequently,
                        workers must be equipped with a broad range of general scientific
                        and specialized information. Vocational-technical, secondary
                        specialized, and higher educational institutions train
                        personnel who can adjust quickly to the changing conditions of
                        production and who combine broad polytechnic and cultural
                        knowledge with an excellent mastery of a specific field and a
                        creative attitude toward work.</p>
                    <p>In the USSR and other socialist countries the right to education
                        is one of the most important manifestations of socialist
                        democracy. Legislatively reinforced by the constitutions of these
                        countries, the right to education is guaranteed in fact by the
                        broad development of a network of various types of schools,
                        including higher and secondary specialized educational institutions.
                        The development of education in the USSR has created the
                        prerequisites for eliminating the difference between mental and
                        physical labor.</p>
                    <p>In an antagonistic class society, the ruling classes use the
                        educational system to reinforce their domination, and the content
                        of education is subordinated to this goal. The contradiction
                        between capitalist production's need for qualified, trained personnel
                        and the drive of the ruling classes to restrict the educational
                        level of the workers for political reasons becomes
                        particularly acute in periods of crisis and reaction and emerges
                        with particular force in the epoch of imperialism. In modern
                        capitalist countries there is a substantial difference in the level
                        of education offered in schools for the masses and in privileged
                        secondary schools.</p>
                    <p>The class historical character of education is manifested not
                        only in the principles on which systems of public education are
                        constructed but also in the ideological orientation of programs,
                        textbooks, and the entire practice of instruction. The socialist
                        school equips students with genuinely scientific knowledge, because
                        the content of education is built on the methodology of
                        Marxism-Leninism, which leads students to a dialectical materialist
                        understanding of the laws of development of nature, society,
                        and thought.</p>
                    <p>Modern technological progress and the increasing cultural
                        requirements of the members of Soviet society have made it
                        necessary to improve the content of education. Scientific and
                        technological progress and the growing volume of scientific information
                        call for continuous education, with workers regularly
                        supplementing their general, polytechnic, and specialized knowledge.
                        Therefore, various forms of improving workers' qualifications
                        and self-education have become very popular in the USSR
                        and other socialist countries.</p>
                    <p>Instruction, which realizes the goals of education, is closely
                        related to the content of education. The goals and character of
                        education greatly influence methods of instruction. The broad
                        application of modern technological means and of methods of
                        independent mental activity have resulted in more effective instruction.
                        Among the school's most important tasks is to inculcate
                        in students an interest in self-education, to develop in them
                        habits of independent work. Citizens engaged in self-education
                        receive a great deal of assistance from state and public organizations,
                        which publish popular science journals and books for mass
                        readership; organize special, educational radio and television
                        broadcasts; show films on science and technology; and strive to
                        develop a network for party political education.</p>
                    <p>Education is closely related to upbringing, or the formation of
                        personality traits. This objective interdependence is evident: education
                        is a necessary and powerful factor in personality development.
                        By providing a general education and equipping students
                        with a knowledge of the laws of development of nature, society,
                        and thought, as well as with work habits and skills, the Soviet
                        school forms communist views, communist convictions, a communist
                        world view, and communist moral and volitional qualities
                        in young people. At the same time, correct training of the
                        personality promotes the successful acquisition of knowledge.
                        The unity of education, study, and upbringing is achieved by
                        putting into practice the principle of study that disciplines the
                        individual and by including the work of upbringing and personality
                        development in the system of extracurricular activities
                        provided by the Pioneer and Komsomol organizations. By combining
                        study with socially useful work and by taking advantage
                        of the influence of a socialist environment, the Soviet school can
                        successfully fulfill the tasks in education and upbringing assigned
                        to it by the Communist Party.</p>

                        <p>(2) In a narrower sense, the object of science, or more precisely, the object of all
                        study in the natural sciences (the <q>"sciences of nature"</q>). Each of the natural
                        sciences studies a different aspect of nature and expresses the results of its research
                        in universal but sufficiently specific laws, of the type exemplified by the laws of
                        mechanics, which describe not nature per se but mechanical movement in nature.</p>
                        <p>
                            <q>"Nature"</q> is a general concept that provides a frame of reference for understanding
                        and explaining various specific subjects of study, such as space and time, movement, and
                        causality. The general concept of <q>"nature"</q> is developed in the philosophy and
                        methodology of science, which isolate its main characteristics, drawing on the results
                        of research in the natural sciences. As an u1timate abstraction whose basic
                        characteristics are universality, conformity to laws, and self-sufficiency, the concept
                        of <q>"nature"</q> first achieved sociocu1tural importance during the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name>, in
                        the struggle against religious dogmatism and Scholasticism (This line of development was
                        dramatically expressed in the anthropocentric art of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name> and in its
                        materialist philosophical systems.) However, the concept's sociocultural status was not
                        consolidated until the establishment of experimental natural science in the 16th and
                        17th centuries.</p>
                        <p>Contemporary natural science has both inherited and significantly enriched the
                        understanding of nature that devetoped in the modern era. This is evident in ideas
                        concerning the development or nature, the specific laws governing nature's development,
                        the various forms of movement of matter and the various structural levels in the
                        organization of nature, as well as in the broadening of ideas about types of causal
                        relationships. For example, the theory of relativity radically changed views on the
                        spatial and temporal organization of objects in nature. The development of modem
                        cosmology has enriched our ideas about the direction of natural processes, the
                        achievements of elementary-particle of the concept of <q>"causality"</q>, and progress
                        in ecology has led to an understanding of the proround principles of the integrity of
                        nature as a single, unified system. At the same time, as a result of the intensive
                        development of the social sciences, the concept of <q>"activity"</q> has joined the
                        concept of <q>"nature"</q> playing an integrating role in cognition.</p>
                        <p>The totality of the natural conditions under which human society exists. In this, the
                        most widely used interpretation, the concept of <q>"nature"</q> refers less to nature
                        per se or nature as the object of the sciences than to nature's place and role in the
                        system or man's and society's historically changing attitudes toward it. The concept of
                        <q>"nature"</q> is used to designate not only the natural conditions of human
                        existence but also the manmade, material ones (<q>"second nature"</q>). As <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">K. Marx</name> observed,
                        the continuous exchange of substances between man and nature is the law regulating
                        social production. Without this exchange, human life would be impossible (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">K. Marx</name> and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">F. Engels</name>,
                        Sock,2nd cd., vol. 23, pp. 51, 514).</p>
                        <p>The real basis for man's relationship to nature arises from human activity, which, in the
                        final analysis, is always carried out in nature, with materials provided by nature.
                        Therefore, throughout the history of society, changes in man's relationship to nature
                        have been determined by changes in the character, direction, and scale of human
                        activity. Primitive man received an overwhelming proportion of his means of subsistence
                        in ready or almost ready form from nature, and the products of his material activity
                        were direct products of nature. Accordingly, the chief factor in the relationship of man
                        and society to nature was direct consumption. The dominance of this type of relationship
                        can be easily traced in the development of cultures based on livestock raising and land
                        cultivation, where the final result of production retains its direct association with
                        nature. The rather rigid spatial and temporal boundaries of human activity were also
                        purely natural. Localized around weakly interconnected centers of culture, buman
                        activity reflected the powemd influence of geographic conditions. Its rhytbm was
                        dictated chlefty by diurnal and seasonal rhythms in nature. Consequently, the cycles of
                        human activity corresponded, on the whole, to natural cycles.</p>
                        <p>This general outline of man's relationship to nature cbanged little, even after the rise
                        of the highly developed culture or classical antiquity. Tbe fundamental structure of
                        material activity, within which the real relationship between nature and society
                        developed, remained virtually untouched. Obtaining and working natural materials
                        continued to be the principal motives for material activity. The scale of the
                        relationship between nature and society did not begin to change noticeably until modern
                        times, in connection with the development of machine production, which demanded new
                        types of raw materials and sources of energy and, consequently, a deeper penetration of
                        nature's <q>"larder"</q>. Man began to take more from nature and to do so in
                        fundamentally different ways. Natural material, were not simply consumed but were
                        processed in more and more far-reaching ways, acquiring new, extranatural properties.
                        Consequently, everything tbat was produced, the social properties created by human
                        activity increasingly outweighed the natural properbes. At this point, relations of
                        consumption were replaced by relations of subjugating or conquering nature, as well as
                        by the expanding exploitation of natural resonrces. This tendency was characteristic of
                        the first industrial revolution, which was preceded by the epoch of great geographic
                        discoveries, a period that contributed to a substantial increase in the volume and
                        number of natural resources exploited.</p>
                        <p>Society was increasingly active in mastering and transforming natural space, creating
                        specifically social fonns of organization -<q>"second nature"</q>, or social space, the
                        laws of which are determined not only by natural conditions but also, to an
                        ever-increasing degree, by social labor. At the same time, the rhythm of human activity
                        changed, losing its direct dependence on rhythms in nature.</p>
                        <p>Until the beginning or the modern scientific and technological revolution, the
                        exploitation of nature was primarily extensive that is, based on increasing the volume
                        and varieties of the resources obtained from nature. The scale or society's activity was
                        virtually unrestricted by outside factors, or nature itself: man could take from nature
                        as much as his productive forces allowed,<q>"without rendering an account."</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the <name type="period">mid-20th century</name> this mode of exploitation began to
                        approach a critical point simultaneously in several respects. The scale on which the
                        traditional sources of energy and raw materials were consumed became comparable to the
                        total remaining reserves of these resources. As a result of rapid population growth, the
                        same condition developed with regard to the natural base for food production. The
                        activity of human society is exerting an increasingly noticeable effect on nature,
                        clearly infringing on natural mecbanisms of self-regulation and radically altering the
                        conditions under which organic matter exists. All or this creates an objectively natural
                        basis and necessity for a transition from extensive to intensive exploitation of
                        nature-that is, to a fuller, more efficient, and more varied utilization of natural
                        resources. From the standpoint of society, the necessity for such a transition is
                        remforced by a change in the character of human activity, which can no longer develop
                        spontaneously under the <pb n="176" facs="images/GSE/GSE.ed3.eng.vol20.0176"/> influence of its own inner logic. Human acticities
                        must be regulated, because the material and natural conditions for it are limited. In
                        contemporary society, the instrument for the regulations of human activity is science -
                        the principal tool for the intensification and rationalization of production and for the
                        planned restruction of the material relations between man and nature. Modern activity is
                        becoming more and more consistently oriented toward science. As a result, a new type of
                        relationship is developing between nature and society-a relationship of global
                        regulation, embracing processes in nature and the activity of society. These programms
                        take into account the kinds and limits of permissible action on nature, as well as the
                        need for preservation and reproduction of nature. Increasingly, nature is becoming an
                        essential and wisely regulated component of the social organism.</p>
                        <p>However, the process of the development of a rational relationsship between society and
                        nature varies, depending on socioeconomic conditions. The founders of <ref target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marxism">Marxism</ref> pointed out that <ref target="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capitalism">capitalism</ref> gives rise to a
                        rapacious attitude toward nature, based on the domination of private, individualistic
                        interests. As <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx"> K.
                            Marx</name> noted, if culture progress spontaneously is not conciously directed, it
                        leaves behind a desert. The practical expereince of modern captialism is evidence that
                        the bourgeois system creates serious obstacles to the rational regulation of nature. It
                        is therefore confronted by various global crises (in ecology and energy, for example) By
                        contrast, the very essence of the socialist system contributes to the rationalization of
                        the relationship between nature and society and to a judicous regulation of nature.</p>
                        <p>
                            <quote>"Socialized man and the associated producers rationally regulate ... their
                        interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control,. . . and achieving
                        this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favorable, and
                        worthy of their human nature"</quote>(<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">K. Marx</name> ibid, vol. 25, part 2, p.
                        387). Of course this does not mean that the principle of rational regulation can be
                        realized automatically: it demands extensive and active efforts.</p>
                        <p> The devolpment of the forms of the human activity also determined changes in man´s
                        intellectual and theoretical relation to nature. However, these changes were directly
                        brought about not by the forms of material production but by their refraction in the
                        formsof intellectual activity. Primitive man, almost completly merged with nature,
                        commonly endowed natural objects with spirits (aninsm). The world of nature appeared to
                        be the world of man, mythology did not yet have a foundation for juxtaposing man and
                        nature. A strictly theoretical attitude toward nature first developed with the
                        separation of philosophy from mythology- that is, with the appearance of theoretical
                        thinking. On the level of values, the theoretical attitude proved to be dualistic. The
                        part of nature that had been drawn into human activity was treated from a utilitarian
                        and pragmatic viewpoint, as a consumption value, a source of resources for man, and a
                        habitat. (This valuational position has survived into the mid-20th century.) On the
                        other hand, nature as a whole was long regarded as a force immeasurably superior to man
                        and, therefore, as an ideal of harmony and perfection not created by human hands.</p>
                        <p> The same type of valuational attitude determined the direction of theoretical
                        speculations about nature. Throughout classical philosophy, nature is treated as
                        perfection, as the focal point of the Logos. The approaches to this interpretation are
                        extremely diverse. For example, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pythagoras">Pythagoras</name> viewed the world and
                        nature as harmony and absolutely perfect order; <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Democritus">Democritus</name> viewed them as the
                        kingdom of elemental forces. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name> took a specific position, anticipating Christianity'S attitude in his
                        interpretation of nature as a pale reflection of an ideal world transcending the
                        material world. Classical thought characteristically treated nature as a standard of
                        organization and a model of wisdom, and usually considered the life lived in accordance
                        with nature and its laws to be the best and the most desirable. In other words, nature
                        was elevated above theoretical thinking as something superior, boundless, inexhaustible,
                        and, in its wholeness, accessible only in an ideal form. An analogous attitude is
                        encountered in other cultures in which theoretical thinking has developed (for example,
                        the Indian and Chinese cultures)</p>
                        <p>A fundamentally different attitude toward nature developed with the establishment of
                        Christianity, which regarded nature as the embodiment of the material principle, as the
                        <q>"here below"</q>, where all is transient and changeable. A sharp distinction is
                        drawn between the eternal, absolute, spiritual principle-god,who stands absolutely above
                        nature-and the earthly, or nature. Unlike antiquity, Christianity stressed not merging
                        with nature but transcending it.</p>
                        <p>The <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name>marked a return to classical ideals in interpreting nature and
                        everything natural as the embodiment of harmony and perfection. Later, this view
                        reappeared in a wide variety of contexts, particularly in the concept of <q>"natural
                            rights"</q> (1.- <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques_Rousseau">J. Rousseau</name>, for example),
                        which derived human rights from the natural laws of human society. Nature was also
                        equated with harmony and perfection by a number of literary and philosophical schools,
                        which promoted the slogan <q>"back to nature"</q>, regarding nature as the only
                        salvation from the destructive effects of the bourgeois order.</p>
                        <p>In modem times, this idealistic attitude toward nature a considerable role in
                        transforming nature into an object of scientific study. However, the original pattern of
                        an idealized, poeticized attitude toward nature was radically transformed as science
                        developed and as man began to master nature by means of industry. Experimental natural
                        science advanced the idea of <q>"testing"</q> nature. In relation to human cognition and
                        action, nature became an object, a sphere of activity, and a mute, inertforce that had
                        to be conquered and subordinated to the rule of reason. </p>
                        <p>This attitude toward nature survives until the domination of nature begins to become a
                        reality. When the world created by human activity becomes commensurate with the world of
                        nature -that is, when the activity of society attains a planetary scale and becomes
                        comparable in volume to the scale of processes in nature-the utilitarian, pragmatic
                        attitude toward nature gradually ceases to be self-sufficient and unlimited and is
                        supplemented by a realization of the growing dependence of nature on man and on human
                        activity. Based on this realization, a new, sociohistorical evaluation of nature
                        emerges, taking as its point of departure an appreciation of nature as the unique and
                        universal abode of man and human culture. Such an appreciation presupposes a responsible
                        attitude toward nature, continuous coordination of the needs of society with nature's
                        capacity to satisfy them, and consideration of the important fact that mankind is part
                        of nature.</p>
                        <p>On the scientific and theoretical level the reorientation of values has been reflected in
                        a shift from the idea of absolute domination over nature to the idea of a relationship
                        between society and nature as partners of equal potential. The first theoretical
                        expression of this position was <name type="person"> V. I. Vernadskii</name>'s concept
                        of the <q>"noosphere"</q> Awareness of the potential (old in some respects, actual)
                        superiority of society to nature has gradually, though by no means painlessly, given
                        rise to a new approach based on the idea of unified, balanced, and responsible
                        regulation of social and natural processes and conditions. In the second half of the
                        20th century this approach has become more popular and has begun to serve as the basis
                        for regulating human activity and the entire system of practical relations between
                        society and nature, including measures for conservation and for environmental
                        protection.</p>
                        <p>However, the process of putting society's relation with nature on a rational foundation
                        is still far from universal. Pollution of the environment and rapacious exploitation of
                        natural resources persist in a number of countries. As a result, ecological pessimism
                        has become widespread in the West. Proceeding from the assumption that human activity
                        results in irreversible destruction in nature, ecological pessimism (in its extreme
                        forms) demands cutbacks in technology. In the capitalist countries this point of view is
                        fostered not only by the existence of unsolved problems in the rationalization of the
                        relation between society and nature but also by the very character of the social system.
                        The experience of socialism shows that a society based on social property is in a
                        position to regulate its relationship with nature intelligently. Although it is by no
                        means possible to solve all problems at once, a planned approach guarantees success and
                        deprives ecological pessimism of its social base.</p>

                        <p>As production expands and new instruments of labor are created,
                        technology frees man from the performance of various production
                         functions requiring both physical and mental labor.
                        Technology is used for many purposes to act on the objects of labor
                        in the creation of material and cultural values, to obtain,
                        transmit, and convert energy, to study the laws of natural and social

                        everyday life, to provide for social government, and to provide
                        for national defense and to wage war. Depending on its purpose,
                        technology is classified as production technology, including
                        power engineering technology, and nonproduction technology,
                        which serves everyday life, scientific research, education, culture,
                        military affairs, and medicine.</p>
                        <p>In its wide range of applications, production technology constitutes
                         the bulk of existing technical means - machines, mechanisms,
                         tools, control equipment for machines and production
                        processes, buildings and other structures used for production,
                        roads, bridges, canals, and means of transportation and communication.
                         The most active sector of production technology is
                        machinery, which can be subdivided into several basic groups production
                         machinery, for metalworking, construction, mining,
                        metallurgy, agriculture, textile production, food processing, and
                        papermaking, transportation machinery, including motor vehicles,
                         diesel and electric locomotives, airplanes, and motor ships,
                        machinery for moving or handling materials, for example, 
                        conveyors, elevators, cranes, and hoists, monitoring and control
                        machinery and computers, including machines for centralized
                        monitoring and control and for data processing, and power-engineering
                         machinery, such as electric machines, internal combustion
                        engines, and turbines. Among modern technical means of
                        production, the highest importance is attached to power-engineering
                        technology, used in obtaining and converting energy.</p>
                        <p>The principal sectors of nonproduction technology are public
                        and domestic technology (municipal maintenance machinery,
                        laundry machines, cooking appliances, refrigerators, vacuum
                        cleaners, television sets, and tape recorders), transportation
                        technology (passenger cars, motorcycles, motor scooters, and bicycles)
                        sports technology (racing cars, yachts, and gymnastics
                        equipment), and educational and cultural technology (technical
                        teaching aids, theatrical scenery, and motion picture and stilt
                        cameras). Military technology comprises a special group of nonproduction
                        means. Its purpose is to equip armed forces with offensive
                        and defensive weapons, such as tanks, conventional and
                        rocket artillery, aircraft, surface vessels, and submarines.</p>
                        <p>No universal classification system for technology has yet been
                        devised. Technology is most often classified according to the area
                        of production involved, for example, industrial technology
                        transportation technology, and agricultural technology or
                        according to particular structural subdivisions of industry, for
                        example, aircraft technology and the technology of land reclamation.
                         In some cases, classification is based on the natural science
                        on which a particular sector is based, for example, nuclear technology,
                        refrigeration technology, and computer technology.</p>

                        Historically, technology
                        has passed through a lengthy process of development -
                        from the crude instruments of primitive man to the most
                        complex automated devices of modern industry. An especially
                        important role in the development of social production was
                        played by machines designed to replace human labor in performing
                         certain production and transportation functions. The invention
                         of spinning jennies and the multipurpose steam engine initiated
                        the industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th
                        centuries, marking the transition from manual to machine production.
                         The improved steam engine could be used ti drive not
                        just one but many machines. This was a precondition for the introduction
                         for various transfer devices, which in many cases
                         formed a complicated mechanical system.</p>

                        Large scale industry owed its development to its most characteristic
                         means of production - the machine. Initially, machine
                        tools, steam engines, and other machines were made individually
                        by skilled workers on a cottage-industry scale. Later, drive 
                        mechanisms, transfer devices, and machines to replace workers
                        increased in size and became more complex. New materials
                        appeared that were difficult to work. These changes gave rise to an
                        objective need for mass production and the use of machinery in
                        industry. By introducing the production of machines by machines,
                        large scale capitalist industry created an adequate technical
                        base.</p>
                        <p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, the technical means of labor
                        penetrated individual elements of production processes and
                        consistently took over entire branches of industry, replacing
                        traditional forms of production based on manual labor and craft
                        technology (see HANDICRAFTS). Machine production became extremely
                        widespread in all industrially developed countries of the
                        world. With the development of large-scale industry, designs
                        were improved and the capacities and productivity of technical
                        devices increased. In the late 19th century the steam engine was
                        gradually supplanted by the more economical and complex
                        internal combustion engine, which allowed new types of machinery to
                        be produced, for example, motor vehicles, tractors, excavators,
                        airplanes, and motor ships. New energy-conversion techniques
                        were found, based on the use of steam turbines and hydroturbines
                        connected to electric power generators.</p>
                        <p>In the first half of the 20th century, the perfected electric motor
                        found universal application as a group or individual drive mechanism
                        for such equipment as metal-cutting and woodworking
                        machine tools, textile machinery, mining machinery, hoisting and
                        transport machinery, and rolling mills.</p>
                        <p>In a machine system, the object of labor passes consecutively
                        through a senes of partial and interrelated processes, which are
                        performed by a variety of different machines that complement
                        one another. In its most developed form, a machine system
                        creates the preconditions for continuous production-line manufacturing
                        and for the increasingly wide introduction of automated
                        machines designed to replace human labor. Such machines
                        independently and without direct human intervention perform all
                        basic and auxiliary operations, such as changing speeds and
                        feeds, reversing, positioning objects and removing them after
                        processing, and applying and removing working elements. Each<pb n="445" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol25.0445"/>
                        automated machine is a complex aggregate containing one or
                        several motors, several transfer devices, several working elements,
                        and special equipment for monitoring, control, and regulation. In
                        the process of the automation of production, automated
                        machines are created that may have dozens of working elements that
                        simultaneously perform highly complex production operations.
                        The technology of automation frees man for arduous labor in the
                        performance of labor-intensive functions, significantly increases
                        labor productivity, and ensures high quality while maintaining
                        uniformity, accuracy, and constant specifications for the goods

                        In technology - whether currently
                        in use or just being introduced - the most important indexes are
                        productivity, reliability, and economy of operation. The productivity
                        and technology is determined by the quantity of goods that
                        can be produced, processed, or shipped per-unit time. The reliability
                        of technology or technical means is characterized by the capacity
                        to produce goods of a specified quality without interruption
                        and in the desired quantity or by the capacity to fulfill a
                        production function within a specified time. The life of production
                        equipment depends not only on the specific qualities and
                        conditions of use of the individual technical means but also on the
                        rate of technical progress, which determines the obsolescence of
                        technology. The rate of technical progress limits the useful life of
                        a machine or mechanism to the amount of time required for more
                        developed technology to appear. Economy of operation is determined
                        by the consumption of raw and other materials, fuel, and
                        power and by the cost of auxiliary facilities necessary for normal
                        operations, such as building foundations and production areas.</p>
                        <p>The productivity, reliability, and economy of operation can be
                        improved by modernization, that is, by perfecting the design of
                        the working elements, drives, and transfer devices and by automating
                        operational processes. Timely modernization makes it
                        possible to extend the useful life of a given technology, ensuring
                        that the technology will continue meeting the demands of scientific
                        and technical progress.</p>
                        <p>Besides conforming the production indexes listed above, modern
                        technology must satisfy the requirements of ergonomics, industrial
                        design, and ecology. Ergonomic criteria specify that the
                        operation of technical systems must correspond to the physiological
                        and neuropsychological functions of workers. The optimum
                        combination of human abilities and technical capacities in a man-machine
                        system substantially increases production efficiency. Industrial
                        design defines the principal requirements and trends in
                        the use of technology to create a harmonious material environment
                        for the purpose of improving the conditions of labor, daily
                        life and leisure. With the expanding scale of technical progress
                        and the rise and development of new areas of technology, the importance
                        of ecological factors is constantly increasing. These factors
                        are associated with the conservation and improvement of the
                        natural environment, the creation of optimum conditions for human
                        activity, and the prevention of the undesirable or harmful effects
                        of production technology and energy-related technology on
                        the earth's mineral resources, atmosphere, flora, and fauna.
                        Thus, the functioning of modern technology and the creation of
                        new types of technology makes it necessary to take the human
                        factor into account.</p>
                        <p>The mechanization and power available per worker are important
                        in assessing the application of technology in various sectors
                        of the national economy and the impact of technology the productivity
                        of social labor. The mechanization available per worker
                        is measured by the value of the machines and mechanisms used in
                        production per worker; the power available per worker is a function
                        of the amount of mechanical and electrical energy used in
                        the production process per man-hour or per worker. Substantial
                        growth in labor productivity in the Soviet economy has been
                        achieved primarily through intensive growth of these two indexes
                        and through the application of new technology in production. In
                        construction, for example, the mechanization available per
                        worker increased by a factor of 13.6 between 1940 and 1973, 
                        permitting a more than fivefold increase in labor productivity.</p>

                        The achievement of technical
                        progress depends primarily on the degree to which industry,
                        construction, agriculture, and transportation are equipped with
                        the most developed means to mechanize and automate 
                        production processes. A significant role is also played by the provision of
                        advanced equipment to the nonproduction sectors of the
                        economy - the service and domestic sectors. The increased output
                        of the basic technical means of production and the development
                        of power-engineering and domestic technology in the

                        <p>Production has developed most intensively in the areas of technology
                        that contribute to the technical re-equipment of the 
                        leading branches of heavy industry; these include machine building
                        for the manufacture of power machinery, electrical equipment
                        machine tools, mining and chemical machine building instrumentation,
                        and production of automation, construction, hoisting,
                        and transportation equipment. Production in agricultural 
                        technology is also characterized by high growth rates, for example, in
                        the production of tractors, harvesters, fodder-processing machinery,
                        transplanting machinery, and self-propelled chassis. The
                        production of electrical household appliances also shows high
                        growth rates.</p>
                        <p>The present period of technological development is characterized
                        by an ever increasing rate of modernization and replacement<pb n="446" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol25.0446"/>
                        of the technical means of production, by the creation of a wide
                        range of new machines, mechanisms, equipment and instru
                        ments, by maximum standardization of products, and by 
                        intensive development of electronics radio engineering, chemical
                        technology, aerospace technology, nuclear technology, automated
                        regulation and control systems, laser technology, and
                        computer technology. A major development pattern in the technology
                        of the second half of the 20th century is the production of
                        integrated machinery, in which various aggregates, operating
                        consecutively in the production process, automatically work on
                        the object of labor. The development of integrated machinery
                        and the growth of automation in industry have led to the creation
                        of automatic transfer lines and automated shops and plants with
                        the highest possible productivity ratings.</p>
                        <p>A typical development pattern in technology is the use of
                        highly efficient technical means to ease mental labor and increase
                        productivity, such technology is now being applied. Advances in
                        electronics, cybernetics, and computer science have created the
                        preconditions for transferring administrative and logical functions,
                        that is, the functions of human intellectual work, from human
                        beings to machines. The use of monitoring and control machines,
                        data-processing equipment, and computers optimizes
                        planning and management in industry, increases the productivity
                        of mental labor, frees man from the performance of many labor-intensive
                        calculations, and reduces expenditures for administrative
                        and managerial equipment. The production and use of office
                        equipment and supplies have expanded, such expansion 
                        simplifies record keeping and increases the efficiency of design, engineering,
                        and economic-planning organizations. Of special importance
                        are the particular technical means that can replace human
                        beings in the performance of exhausting or unhealthful operations
                        (<hi rend="italic">see</hi> ROBOT).</p>
                        <p>One of the special features of modern technology is the
                        rapid - sometimes extremely rapid - penetration of new technology
                         into many branches of production and science, including
                        areas where applications are difficult to predict. One example is
                        the progress in laser technology over a period of less than two
                        decades (see QUANTUM ELECTRONICS and LASER TECHNOLOGY).</p>

                        The development of
                        technology through wide application of scientific knowledge is a
                        prime condition for scientific and technical progress. In the past,
                        technology represented primarily the accumulation of empirical
                        knowledge and experience and the embodiment of this knowledge
                        and experience in the instruments of labor. Today, scientific
                        knowledge is increasingly embodied in technology. The steam
                        engine was constructed on an empirical basis, and for half a century
                        its theory was outdistanced by its technology. The most 
                        important technological achievements of the modern period have
                        been the result of major scientific discoveries (<hi rend="italic">see</hi>
                            <ref target="#SCIENCE">SCIENCE</ref>).
                        It is no longer possible through purely empirical means to produce
                        such technical means of production as nuclear reactors, lasers,
                        and computers. These can only be created after the physical
                        chemical, and other phenomena and processes that underlie their
                        operation have been studied and fully understood. The needs of
                        industry itself require the preliminary study, theoretical 
                        generalization, and analysis of these phenomena, as well as the ability to
                        predict the peculiarities of such phenomena under conditions not
                        yet studied. Thus, an indispensable condition for the development
                         of technology and, consequently, of material production is
                        that science develop in advance of technology and practical
                        applications.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it is production and the needs of production
                        that exert a decisive influence on scientific development. The
                        technical level of production governs the extent to which science
                        is utilized and the degree to which the technical base of production
                         is prepared to apply new scientific ideas. Moreover, the material
                        and technical basis for production also creates the material
                        basis for scientific research and decisively influences the quality
                        of scientific experiments and the extent to which science is industrialized.
                        Modern science is equipped with highly complex technical
                        equipment, including experimental nuclear reactors, facilities
                        for the study of thermonuclear synthesis, synchrocyclotrons, and
                        powerful radio telescopes.</p>
                        <p>The intensive development and interaction of science and technology
                        and the transformation of science into a primary productive
                        force constitute one of the most important aspects of the
                        modern scientific and technical revolution. Changes taking place
                        in all spheres of current technology are based on scientific 
                        discoveries and advances.</p>
                        <p>Technical means, systems equipment, and production methods
                        are undergoing fundamental changes. A transition is being
                        made from the mechanization of individual labor processes to the
                        integrated mechanization and automation of production as a
                        whole and to extensive utilization of automatic control systems
                        using computers. In line with the progress of science and technology,
                        total electrification in the USSR has been carried out, and a
                        new source of power for industry has been created through efficient
                        use of traditional and new forms of energy. Mechanical
                        methods of processing materials have in many cases been
                        replaced or supplemented by more refined processes that make use
                        of the latest achievements of physics and chemistry, these include
                        ultrasonic, high-frequency, and laser processes, electron 
                        dicharge machining, and other forms of processing. The development
                        of bionics has made it possible to use biological methods efficiently
                        in solving engineering problems and to apply lessons
                        drawn from the study of organic life to various areas of technology.
                        Biotechnology has developed rapidly, making possible various
                         biological techniques for obtaining many products and substances,
                        for example, in the production of protein foods,
                        enzymes, and vitamins. The progress of chemistry and chemical
                        technology has made it possible to change the properties of natural
                         materials, produce a wide range of synthetic materials, and
                        speed up production processes, thus increasing labor productivity and
                        improving the quality of industrial production.</p>
                        <p>The intensive development of natural and applied sciences enables
                        man to gain an active knowledge of the microcosm,
                        expands the scope of human activity, makes space exploration possible,
                        and leads to practical use of space technology in the
                        national economy.</p>
                        <p>Progress in space research is an example of the fruitful interaction
                         of science and technology and of the way in which joint development
                        enriches both. The creation and development of space
                        technology have stimulated progress in the applied sciences and
                        allied branches of industry, particularly radio electronics, automation,
                        manufacture of precision instruments, and materials science.
                        Space technology has also benefited the natural and social
                        sciences, giving rise to entirely new fields of study, for example,
                        space physics, space biology, and space medicine and those aspects
                        of philosophy, psychology, and law dealing with outer
                        space.</p>
                        <p>In precisely the same way, the development of data-processing
                        and computer technology has drawn a whole complex of sciences
                        into the study of communication and control processes. As a result,
                        many general scientific problems have been posed, including
                        problems in information transmission and the interaction between
                        man and machines. The interaction between science and
                        technology is one of the most important conditions for scientific
                        and technical progress and for social development as a whole.</p>

                        The development of
                        technology depends on the system of social production. The rate
                        of technical progress is governed by socioeconomic factors and by
                        the correspondence between production relations and the level of
                        development of the productive forces, in which technology is the
                        element most subject to change. In the history of technology
                        there have been many instances in which production relations
                        conflicted with the development of the productive forces and
                        hindered the appearance and application of new inventions.
                        There have also been many cases in which production relations
                        have corresponded to the level of development of the productive
                        forces, thus fostering the rapid development of technology.</p>
                        <p>Technology not only depends on the socioeconomic conditions
                        in one or another social order for its development and acts as a
                        revolutionizing element of the productive forces, but it also contributes
                        to changing these conditions. The degree to which technology
                        has developed determines to a significant extent the level
                        of social development. <cit>

                         Radical changes in technology bring about
                        a chain reaction of changes in the economic and social institutions
                        of a society. Thus, machine production created the conditions for<pb n="447" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol25.0447"/>
                        an unparalleled growth in the productivity and socialization of
                        labor and for the replacement of small-scale cottage production by
                        large-scale production. However in capitalist society the 
                        progress brought about by machine industry has been accompanied by
                        increased social contradictions. Under these conditions, the use
                        of technology, which is governed by the need to increase profits,
                        leads to the destruction of many small producers of goods and is
                        accompanied by increased exploitation of the working class, unemployment
                        and inflation. Machine production makes cooperative

                        In socialist society, technology is a mighty weapon for easing human
                        labor in every possible way and steadily increasing social
                        production.</p>
                        <p>The development of technology and progress in any sphere of
                        technology are related to the intensification of the specialization
                        of production and to the expansion of the international division
                        of labor. Such development depends not only on socioeconomic
                        features but also on the geographic, climatic, and other peculiarities
                        of a country. The specific conditions in Great Britain, for example,
                        determined the intensive development of shipbuilding
                        and maritime and port technology. Special conditions fostered
                        machine-building, mining, and metallurgical technology in the
                        Federal Republic of Germany, electrical-engineering and radio
                        electronics technology in Japan, precision instrument technology
                        in Switzerland, and the technology of the lumber and pulp and
                        paper industries in Finland. In the socialist countries that cooperate
                         economically within the framework of the Council for Mutual
                        Economic Assistance (COMECON), branches of modern 
                        technology have developed successfully, they include power-engineering,
                         mining, metallurgical construction, agricultural, transportation,
                        and printing technology, as well as the technology of
                        light industry and the textile and food industries. The socialist
                        countries, in particular the USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and
                        the German Democratic Republic, have also provided significant
                        technical assistance to developing countries.</p>
                        <p>In the socialist mode of production, all scientific and technical
                        advances are used to develop the productive forces and satisfy
                        the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the workers,
                        thus creating the best opportunities for the development of
                        technology. Scientific and technical progress in the socialist countries
                         constitutes the material foundation for a constant increase in
                        the efficiency of social production. It contributes to the creation
                        of new instruments of labor, materials, and production processes
                        and brings about qualitative changes in the structure of production.
                         This, in turn serves as the source of expanded socialist reproduction,
                        the growth of the national income, and the systematic
                        rise in the material and cultural standard of living.</p>
                        <p>The influence of modern technology on society is not limited to
                        the areas of material production and science, although these continue
                        to be the principal areas affected. For example, the development
                        of military technology and especially of strategic weapons
                        determines important aspects of government relations and is
                        reflected in national economies. The educational system, culture,
                        and everyday life are transformed to a considerable degree by the
                        impact of constantly developing technology. The cinema, radio,
                        and television have given rise to new art forms and have exerted a
                        profound influence on human culture in general by making culture
                        accessible to the masses. The appearance and increasing use
                        of technical teaching aids, especially monitoring and training
                        equipment and training simulators, have raised the efficiency of
                        instruction in secondary and higher educational institutions, and
                        facilitated the introduction of programmed teaming.</p>
                        <p>There has been a constant increase in the development of domestic
                         technology, used to lighten the burden of many domestic
                        chores and to add comfort to everyday life. Automated facilities
                        in commercial and domestic spheres have become common. Domestic
                         services that specialize in the sale and servicing of household
                         appliances have appeared in many countries.</p>
                        <p>Modern technology has stimulated the development of physical
                        culture, sports and medicine. For example, the use of lasers
                        as surgical instruments (in quantum ophthalmocoagulators) has
                        made possible the development of an important branch of
                        medicine - ophthalmic microsurgery. Technology also influences
                        an individual's psychology and world view.</p>
                        <p>The development of certain forms of modern technology has
                        contributed to international technical cooperation. Cooperation
                        is vital because of the complexity and high cost of such technologies,
                         which necessitate joint efforts by scientific institutions in
                        many different countries to obtain up to date scientific and technical
                        results. Cooperation in the field of television has resulted in
                        the creation of the Intervision and Eurovision systems. Scientific
                        and technical cooperation in atomic energy is coordinated by the
                        International Atomic Energy Agency. The socialist countries
                        practice technical cooperation through such organizations as 
                        Intermetall (in the area of ferrous metallurgy) and Interkhim (in
                        the manufacture of chemical products). In space science, there
                        has been the joint Soviet-American flight by Soyuz and Apollo
                        crews in 1975, international cooperation by the socialist countries
                        is carried out through the Interkosmos program.</p>
                        <p>Many major scientific and technical problems of the future,
                        such as travel to other planets of the solar system, the development
                        of global radio and television communication, and the creation
                         of new types of medical equipment, require synthesis of the
                        technical experience and scientific advances of many different
                        countries. International cooperation in science and technology is
                        an effective means of carrying out major programs aimed at solving
                        the most important tasks of scientific and technical progress

a branch of philosophy dealing with two related
classes of phenomena—namely, the sphere of the aesthetic as a 
specific manifestation of man's value relationship to the world
and the sphere of man's artistic activity</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The relation between the two divisions of aesthetics changed in
the course of its history; aesthetics itself has been subject to varying
interpretations, ranging from attempts to reduce it to the
<q>"philosophy of the beautiful"</q> to its interpretation as the
                                    <q>"philosophy of art"</q>. It has been suggested more than once that
aesthetics be divided into several independent scientific disciplines—
a theory of aesthetic values, a theory of aesthetic perception,
and a general theory of art. But experience has shown that
the aesthetic values of the actual world and the latter's embodiment
in art are so closely related that it is practically impossible
to study them in isolation. This has often led to another extreme,
which is the identification of man's artistic and aesthetic activities,
whose interrelationship is actually quite complex. Thus, although
the two divisions of aesthetics are organically related,
each is relatively autonomous.</p>
                        <p>The first division of aesthetics deals with such questions as the
nature and specific character of the aesthetic in the system of value
relations; the objective laws of differentation of aesthetic values
in their multiple modifications (such as the beautiful and the
ugly, the sublime and the base, or the tragic and the comic); the
dialectical relation between aesthetic values and aesthetic judgments
on the one hand, and between aesthetic perception and
aesthetically oriented practice on the other; the meaning of man's
aesthetic activity in public and private life and in different cultural
areas; and the interrelation of the aesthetic and the artistic
in the various spheres in which they are manifested, such as practical
activity, contemplation, or people's upbringing and education.</p>
                        <p>The second division of aesthetics is devoted to the specialized
analysis of artistic activity. It is a science whose subject matter includes
the origins of such activity, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically;
its specific structural and functional character as
compared to other types of human activity—that is, its place in
culture; the relationship between the artistic process, the structure
of the works of art in which that process is embodied, and
man's perception of the works themselves; the laws underlying
the diversity of concrete forms (types, kinds, and genres of art)
and modifications of artistic activity in the course of history
(trends, styles, and methods); the traits that distinguish the contemporary
stage in society's artistic development; and the historical
prospects for the development of art in the future.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that aesthetics was never limited to the mere
study of the objective laws governing man's aesthetic and artistic
apprehension of the world. In one way or another, aesthetics has
always guided such apprehension by formulating definite criteria
of aesthetic judgment and programs of artistic activity. The relative
weight of this normative element in aesthetics has varied
over time (as can be seen, for example, by comparing the normative
aesthetics of classicism to the antinormative aesthetics of romanticism);
in one way or another, however, the scientific and
cognitive functions of aesthetics are always intertwined with its
valuational, regulative, and ideological functions.</p>
                        <p>The long historical process of the rise and development of aesthetics
was determined by a number of factors—namely, the
ideological and sociopsychological positions of various classes
and social groups as expressed and theoretically substantiated in
aesthetics; the changing character of the object of study—that is,
of the subject matter of aesthetic culture and artistic practice; the
nature of the philosophical doctrines that form the background or
the basis of aesthetic theories; and the positions characterizing
such related disciplines as literary and art scholarship, psychology,
and sociology.</p>
                        <p>Aesthetic thinking arose in earliest antiquity as part of the
mythological consciousness of preclass society. When analyzed,
the myths of various peoples are seen to be imprinted with man's
initial conceptions of the various arts' origin and role in people's
lives and of the connection between art and beauty (as exemplified
in the ancient Greek myth of the <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/MusE">Muses</name> 
                    led by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apollo">Apollo Musagetes</name>).
Aesthetics proper, however, did not emerge before the
development of theoretical scientific thought.</p>
                        <p>In the first stage of its development, which in Europe lasted until
the mid-18th century, aesthetics was not yet an independent
scientific discipline and did not even have a name of its own. In
                    <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classical_antiquity">antiquity</name>, 
                    for example, aesthetic problems might be treated from
the philosophical point of view—as they were by the Pythagoreans
and by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/SOCRATES">Socrates</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plato">Plato</name>, and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aristotle">Aristotle</name>; or they might be discussed
in treatises dealing with the theory of various types of art,
such as the works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polyclitus_(freedman)">Polyclitus</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gorgias">Gorgias</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lucius_Vitruvius_Cordo">Vitruvius</name>, and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horace">Horace</name>.
Nevertheless, many of the profound ideas set forth by these early
thinkers laid the foundations for the whole subsequent development
of European aesthetic thought. (Oriental aesthetics followed
a different course, with only occasional contacts with European
aesthetics.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_Ages">Medieval</name> 
                    Christian aesthetics used spiritualist concepts as the
theoretical basis of aesthetic phenomena; the structure of art was
interpreted from the symbolic point of view by such thinkers as
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augustine_of_Hippo">Augustine</name> 
                    and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</name>. 
                    It was only in the age of the
                    <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renaissance">Renaissance</name> 
                    that aesthetic thought threw off the bonds of theology
and took on its secular, humanist, and realistic orientation.
This, however, led to the gradual loosening of the ties between
aesthetics and philosophy, which from that time based itself directly
on the natural sciences and showed little interest in aesthetic
and artistic issues. Practicing artists, on the other hand, did
have an interest in such issues, inasmuch as the radical changes in
artistic-methods called for theoretical substantiation. Accordingly,
most of the aesthetic problems of the time were discussed in
treatises on art written by major artists, such as 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leon_Battista_Alberti">L. B. Alberti</name>,
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</name>, 
                    and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albrecht_Dürer">A. Durer</name>, and by theorists in various
                        types of art.</p>
                        <p>In the 17th and first half of the 18th centuries, the question of
the nature of beauty and art was still discussed in theoretical treatises
dealing with the different varieties of art (for example, in the
works of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolas_Boileau-Despréaux">N. Boileau</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Sorel,_sieur_de_Souvigny">C. Sorel</name>, 
                    and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mikhail_Lomonosov">M. V. Lomonosov</name>) or in
                    works of art criticism (such as those of 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Jakob_Bodmer">J. Bodmer</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Jakob_Breitinger">J. Breitinger</name>,
                    and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denis_Diderot">D. Diderot</name>). 
                    As a result of the orientation of aesthetics toward
the practice of art, the primary emphasis was on the theoretical
substantiation and defense of specific artistic methods,
styles, and trends, such as mannerism, classicism, the baroque,
and realism.</p>
                        <p>The clash between different artistic programs—such as the
struggle between <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denis_Diderot">Diderot</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing">G. E. Lessing</name> over realism or the
polemics between the partisans of classicism and of the baroque
in Italy and Spain—clearly reflected the struggle between ideologies.
The ideology of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Age_of_Enlightenment">Enlightenment</name> gave particular impetus
and scope to the theoretical elucidation of the new paths of art,
giving rise throughout Europe to the movement known as Enlightenment
aesthetics (represented by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denis_Diderot">Diderot</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">J.-J. Rousseau</name>
                    in France, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing">Lessing</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Joachim_Winckelmann">J.J. Winckelmann</name> in Germany, and
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anthony_Ashley-Cooper">A. Shaftesbury</name>
                            <note type="uncertainty" resp="#alexey.gorobiy">It is not clear here which one of 12 Earls of Shaftesbury is meant. - Alexey Gorobiy</note> and H. Home in Great Britain). In spite of its
strength, the movement was still quite heterogeneous in its philosophical
and artistic concerns.</p>
                        <p>The growing interest in art and in its ability to mold man's view
    of the world<pb n="6" facs="images/GSE3/GSE.ed3.eng.vol30.0006"/> led to the attempt to contrast the various forms of art
(for example, by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Baptiste_Dubos">J.B. Dubos</name> and 
                    <name type="person">J. Harris</name>
                            <note type="uncertainty" resp="#alexey.gorobiy">It is not clear here which one of people called J. Harris is meant. - Alexey Gorobiy</note>) and later to the notion
                    of the unity of all the <q>"fine arts"</q> (as exemplified by
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_Batteux">C. Batteux</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moses_Mendelssohn">M. Mendelssohn</name>). Arising in this context was the
question of taste, which was viewed as a specific psychic mechanism
enabling man to perceive and evaluate beauty and the fruits
of artistic creativity. This was the point of convergence of art
scholarship and philosophy, the latter having increasingly come
to include aesthetic problems in its field of inquiry (as in the treatises
of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giambattista_Vico">G. Vico</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claude-Adrien_Helvetius">C. A. Helvetius</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voltaire">Voltaire</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Hume">D. Hume</name>, and
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edmund_Burke">E. Burke</name>). In the mid-18th century, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten">A.G. Baumgarten</name>, a follower
                    of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gottfried_Leibniz">G.W. von Leibniz</name>, demonstrated the need for a separate
branch of philosophy to deal with these questions, along with
ethics and logic, and he called this branch <q>"aesthetics"</q>, or the
                    <q>"theory of sense-derived knowledge"</q>. Out of this theory, <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten">Baumgarten</name>
developed an integrated and coherent doctrine about
beauty and art—beauty being defined by him as the <q>"perfection
    of sense-derived knowledge"</q>, and art as the embodiment of
    beauty.</p>
                        <p>
Aesthetics thus entered its second stage, in the course of which
it was transformed into a separate branch of philosophy; its independent
development was essential in order for philosophy to offer
a satisfactory explanation of culture, human activity, and social
history. The course mapped out by 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten">Baumgarten</name> was followed
by the major representatives of German philosophy and culture
—<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immanuel_Kant">I. Kant</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Gottfried_Herder">J.G. Herder</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Schiller">F. Schiller</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">J.W. von Goethe</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling">F.W. von Schelling</name>, 
    and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">G.W.F. Hegel</name>.</p>
                        <p>Undeniably, the romantic movement of the early 19th century,
having enriched aesthetics with the discovery of the many objective
laws of art that were inaccessible to the rationalist and metaphysical
thinkers of the <name type="period" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Age_of_Enlightenment">Enlightenment</name>, was undermining with its
antirationalism the basis of aesthetics as a systematic scientific
theory. <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Hegel</name>, however, overcame these tendencies—so dangerous
to scientific aesthetics—by restoring the status of reason and
opening up before it the dialectical path to knowledge. He constructed
an impressive doctrine of aesthetics in which theoretical
analysis was organically combined with the historical approach to
man's artistic activity and to its development and place in culture.
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Hegel</name> thus brought to its conclusion the stage—initiated by
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Gottlieb_Baumgarten">Baumgarten</name>—in which aesthetics had evolved as a branch of the
encyclopedic and all-encompassing philosophy grounded in the
idealist world view.</p>
                        <p>The third stage in the history of aesthetics, which began after
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel">Hegel</name>, has been marked by bitter struggle between different
methodological and ideological orientations. The ideological
struggle produced three distinct trends in the aesthetic thought of
the 19th and 20th centuries: bourgeois aesthetics, democratic aesthetics,
and proletarian socialist aesthetics.</p>
                        <p>Bourgeois aesthetics used a variety of methods to substantiate
aestheticism and the principles of <q>"pure art"</q>, or <q>"art for art's
    sake"</q>; this group ranges from the Parnassians and K. Fiedler's
                    school to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/José_Ortega_y_Gasset">J. Ortega y Gasset</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbert_Read">H. Read</name>. Democratic aesthetics
took two forms—as expressed in the theories of the Utopian socialist
thinkers, ranging from <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon">P. Proudhon</name> 
                    to <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leo_Tolstoy">L.N. Tolstoy</name>, and
in the revolutionary democratic conceptions of the Russian thinkers
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vissarion_Belinsky">V.G. Belinskii</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alexander_Herzen">A.I. Herzen</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolai_Chernyshevsky">N.G. Chernyshevskii</name>, and
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikolay_Dobrolyubov">N.A. Dobroliubov</name>; both groups advocated the principles of realism,
holding that the arts must be closely tied to the actual life of
society and must be critical of bourgeois reality. Proletarian socialist
aesthetics was formulated by <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karl_Marx">K. Marx</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Engels">F. Engels</name>, and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Lenin">V.I. Lenin</name>; important contributions to its development were made by
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franz_Mehring">F. Mehring</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paul_Lafargue">P. Lafargue</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Georgi_Plekhanov">G.V. Plekhanov</name>,

                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antonio_Gramsci">A. Gramsci</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/György_Lukács">G. Lukacs</name>, and many other Marxist-Leninists in
    various countries of the world.</p>
                        <p>The philosophical and methodological diversity of 19th- and
20th-century aesthetics stems from its reliance on different philosophical
doctrines, such as the various forms of objective idealism
(<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friedrich_Theodor_Vischer">F.T. Vischer</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vladimir_Solovyov_(philosopher)">V.S. Solov'ev</name>), subjective idealism
                    (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/André_Breton">A. Breton</name>), positivism (
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herbert_Spencer">H. Spencer</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hippolyte_Taine">H. Taine</name>, and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Dewey">J. Dewey</name>),
                    intuitionism (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benedetto_Croce">B. Croce</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Henri_Bergson">H. Bergson</name>), anthropological materialism
                    (the aesthetics of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_Andreas_Feuerbach">Feuerbach</name> and of the Russian revolutionary
                    democrats), phenomenology (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicolai_Hartmann">N. Hartmann</name>, 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roman_Ingarden">R. Ingarden</name>,
                    and <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mikel_Dufrenne">M. Dufrenne</name>), 
                    and existentialism (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Paul_Sartre">J.-P. Sartre</name> and 
    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Martin_Heidegger">M. Heidegger</name>).</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of the differentiation of aesthetic doctrines in
this age is the attempt to link aesthetics to one or another specific
science. This gave rise to the psychological aesthetics of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gustav_Fechner">G. Fechner</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Theodor_Lipps">T. Lipps</name>, the physiological aesthetics of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grant_Allen">Grant Allen</name> and 
                    <name type="person">V.V. Veliamovich</name>, the psychoanalytic aesthetics
                    of <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sigmund_Freud">S. Freud</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jacques_Lacan">J. Lacan</name>, the sociological aesthetics of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jean-Marie_Guyau">M. Guyau</name> and 
                    <name type="person">C. Lalo</name>, the aesthetics of art criticism of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eduard_Hanslick">E. Hanslick</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hans_Sedlmayr">H. Sedlmayr</name>, the semiotic aesthetics of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charles_W._Morris">C. Morris</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umberto_Eco">U. Eco</name>, the cybernetics and information aesthetics
                    of <name type="person">A. Moles</name> and 
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Max_Bense">M. Bense</name>, and the mathematical aesthetics of
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_David_Birkhoff">G. Birkhoff</name>. Finally, 19th- and 20th-century aesthetic doctrines
may be differentiated according to the particular artistic or literary
trend whose theoretical basis they constitute—for example,
critical realism (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Honoré_de_Balzac">H. Balzac</name> and the Russian revolutionary democrats),
                    naturalism (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Émile_Zola">E. Zola</name>), symbolism (
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vyacheslav_Ivanov_(poet)">Viacheslav Ivanov</name> and
                    <name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andrei_Bely">A. Belyi</name>), or abstractionism 
    (<name type="person" key="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wassily_Kandinsky">W. Kandinsky</name>).</p>
                        <p>Marxist aesthetics is fundamentally different from all other
19th- and 20th-century aesthetic trends in that it is built on the
philosophical foundations of dialectical and historical materialism
and serves as the theoretical platform of socialist realism;
among those who have participated in its formulation, in addition

                        <p>In our own time, Marxist-Leninist aesthetics is growing in prestige
throughout the world. In the socialist countries it is the theoretical
basis for cultural development through the arts and for the
aesthetic education of the working masses. Throughout its history,
Marxist-Leninist aesthetics has sought to perfect itself in the
accomplishment of these tasks, and it has developed along with
scientific thought, philosophy, and contemporary art; it fights
against dogmatic and revisionist distortions, and it masters complex
and systems-analysis approaches that help overcome any
type of onesidedness in the interpretation of aesthetic problems.
Admittedly, many of these problems are yet to find unequivocal
solutions, and they give rise to lively theoretical discussions—for
example, on the relationship between the natural and the social
in the sphere of aesthetic values, on the basic social functions of
art, and on the nature of realism; but the general outline of the
Marxist theory of aesthetics today is clear enough for anyone to
discern.</p>
                        <p>Marxist aesthetics starts from the proposition that man's practical
activity is the basis of his aesthetic relation to the world. In
the course of social labor man develops the ability, unknown to
animals, to create and to apply aesthetic criteria to everything <cit>

                            </cit>. As a result, man begins
to discover a variety of aesthetic values in society and in
nature—such as beauty and grandeur, harmony and drama, tragedy
and comedy. Thus the sphere of aesthetic laws and of aesthetic
principles and criteria extends far beyond the limits of art;
this means that man's aesthetic activity in the socialist society
cannot be limited to artistic activity but must range, without exception,
over all spheres of life. Accordingly, aesthetic education
cannot be reduced to artistic education—that is, to molding
man's attitudes toward art or using the arts as means of education;
it must be made an organic part of education in all its forms,
including work training, moral and political instruction, and
physical education—this being a prerequisite for the development
of an integrated, harmonious, and well-rounded personality.</p>
                        <p>Marxist-Leninist aesthetics shows that art plays a special role in
the achievement of this goal, inasmuch as it combines various
ways in which man can be influenced, including the aesthetic and
the moral; in other words, because it molds man as a whole
rather than affecting him one-sidedly. This is the conclusion
reached by aesthetic science through its study of the origins and
development of the arts and examination of their structure and
social functions.</p>
                        <p>The arts are born of the need to preserve cultural continuity, to
accumulate human experience, and to transmit such experience
from generation to generation and from society to the individual.
By supplementing and purposefully expanding the actual experience
of the individual, art serves as a powerful means of spiritually
molding each new member of society; it helps him assimilate
the values, norms, and ideals accumulated by culture and corre

sponding to the needs of a particular society's way of life or of a
particular class, ethnic group, or social milieu. Thus the arts dialectically
combine what is common to all mankind, what is historically
subject to change, and what is specific to particular nations,
classes, and individuals. This dialectics is embedded in the system
of social and aesthetic coordinates used in Marxist-Leninist aesthetics
to describe each separate artistic phenomenon—namely,
historical specificity, national distinctiveness, class character,

                            </term> (party spirit), and uniqueness.</p>
                        <p>The underlying social function of art determines the way the
artist represents reality, which in aesthetics is called the artistic
image. The artistic image is the smallest indivisible <q>"cell"</q> of the
                                    artistic <q>"tissue"</q> imprinted with all the basic attributes of art; it is
a form of cognition and simultaneously of evaluation of reality,
expressing the artist's attitude toward the world. The artistic image
joins together the objective and the subjective, the material
and the spiritual, the external and the internal; it is a reflection of
reality and at the same time transforms it, since it must express
the unity of the object and the subject and therefore cannot
merely be a copy of its prototype in life. Finally, by transmitting
to people what the artist wants to say about the world and about
himself, the artistic image simultaneously assumes a double
function—of a specific poetic, ideological, or aesthetic meaning
and of the particular sign conveying that meaning.</p>
                        <p>This unique structure of the artistic <q>"tissue"</q> makes art in one
respect similar to science, in another respect to morality, in a
third respect to the products of technology, and in a fourth respect
to language; nevertheless, art retains its sovereignty inasmuch
as it is the carrier of a particular kind of information that is
inaccessible to all other forms of social consciousness. Therefore
the relationship between art and other ways in which man
achieves mastery over the world is based on the dialectics of mutual
attraction and mutual repulsion, whose specific forms are determined
by different sociohistorical, class, and ideological requirements.
Sometimes, for example, art is closely bound to
religion and is antagonistic toward science; at other times, on the
contrary, it is viewed as a cognitive method akin to science and
inimical to religion; and at still other times, art is seen as different
from all other types of nonaesthetic and utilitarian activity and is
regarded as a game.</p>
                        <p>In the socialist society, Marxist-Leninist aesthetics guides the
arts toward the dialectic solution of any given contradiction—that
is, it encourages artistic creativity to strengthen as much as possible
its ties with ideology, science, technology, sports, and the various
means of communication and at the same time to affirm the
specific nature of its artistic, poetic, and aesthetic attributes.</p>
                        <p>The general principles according to which the artistic image is
structured are variously refracted in each of the many different
forms, types, and genres of art and literature. Accordingly, every
specific means of artistic activity has a distinctive content and a
distinctive form, determining its particular ability to influence
man and its particular place in the artistic culture. This is why literature,
music, the theater, and painting, under different historical
and cultural circumstances, have played different roles in the
spiritual life of society; and for the same reason, works in the
epic, lyric, and dramatic modes have varied in their relative
weight at the various stages of development of the arts, as have
the genres of the novel and novella, narrative poem and symphony,
historical painting and still life.</p>
                        <p>Aesthetic theory has been inclined during any particular age to
absolutize the specific relationship existing between the arts at
the given time. As a result, a particular form, type, or genre of
art has been exalted at the expense of the others and has been
viewed as a kind of <q>"ideal model"</q> of a work of art, presumably
expressing most fully and vividly the very essence of artistic creativity.
This kind of one-sided approach has been successfully
overcome in the Marxist science of aesthetics, which with increasing
consistency has been advocating the principle of the equality
of all forms, types, and genres of art and at the same time revealing
why any particular one might be predominant during a given
period in history. Aesthetics can thus illuminate, first, the general
laws that govern art in all its specific forms; second, the morphological
laws governing the transition from the general to the particular
and individual; and, finally, the historical laws underlying
the uneven development of the various forms, types, and genres
of art.</p>
                        <p>Aesthetics reaches its theoretical conclusions and generalizations
by drawing on comprehensive studies of the arts carried out
in various disciplines—art and literary scholarship, psychology,
sociology, semiotics, and cybernetics. Aesthetics, however, is not
absorbed by any of these disciplines; it retains its philosophical
nature, which enables it to construct an integral theoretical
model of artistic activity. This model may be viewed as a specific
system consisting of three elements—creative process, work of
art, and artistic perception. The relationship between them is a
special form of communication that is essentially different from
scientific, business, and technical communication, inasmuch as
works of art are made to be perceived by man as an individual,
with all his unique life experience, his individually formed consciousness
and feelings, his own set of associations, and his own
inimitable spiritual world. A work of art therefore demands the
perceiver's coauthorship, empathy, deep experiencing, and personal
interpretation.</p>
                        <p>The sociological approach to the arts has established the definite
role of social factors in determining the inner world of all the
personalities involved in the <q>"artistic dialogue"</q>—the personality
of the artist, author, or composer, of the performer (actor or musician),
of the protagonist in the work of art, and of the reader,
listener, or viewer; consequently, the influence of the arts on the
human soul is a form of the social education of the individual, or
an instrument of socialization. Accordingly, aesthetics reveals
the world of the arts today as a specific sphere in which are manifested
the overall sociohistorical collisions of our age and the
struggle of two opposing social systems, representing the bourgeois
and communist ideologies.</p>
                        <p>The theory of socialist realism formulated by Marxist-Leninist
aesthetics is of tremendous practical importance. The mission of
socialist realism is to guide creative activity on the course that will
match the interests of the communist society—molding its members
into well-rounded and harmoniously developed human beings
who will be the bearers of civic high-mindedness, moral virtue,
political consciousness and conviction, social activism, and
psychological sensitivity. To the extent that the basic principle of
the socialist society is the unity of the interests, ideals, and aspirations
of the entire people and the uniqueness of each individual—
to that extent the unity of creative methods in the art of socialist
realism is a precondition for its wealth of artistic styles, while its

                        containing the most essential information in all fields of knowledge
                         or practical activity (in the case of general, or world, encyclopedias)
                        or in a particular field (specialized encyclopedias). In
                        concentrated form, encyclopedias present certain viewpoints
                        with respect to nature and society.</gloss>
                        In addition to reflecting the
                        level of science and culture of a given age, an encyclopedia carries
                        a definite ideological charge, which expresses the interests of
                        the class on whose behalf the work is published and to which its
                        authors belong.</p>
                        <p>According to their structure encyclopedias may be alphabetic
                        (the material being arranged in alphabetic order) or systematic,
                        depending on their size, they are conventionally classified as
                        large (more than a dozen volumes), small (ten to 12 volumes),
                        concise (four to six volumes), and one-, two-, or three-volume
                        encyclopedias, which are usually called encyclopedic dictionaries.
                        In every encyclopedia the subject matter is arranged according
                        to a specific plan (that is, the entire content is subdivided into
                        the various disciplines and types of articles) and according to a
                        preliminary article list (which gives the titles of all the articles).</p>
                        <p>Encyclopedias may contain different types of articles - namely,
                        survey articles, informational articles, definitions (articles that
                        only define a term and in cases of foreign derivation, give the
                        term's etymology) and cross references (which refer the reader
                        to other articles). The first two types, which differ chiefly in
                        length are distinctive of encvclopedias, they contain the basic
                        and essential information on a given subject, such as the explanation
                        of a scientific theory, the history of an event, and geographic,
                        biographical and statistical data.</p>
                        <p>For the reader who wishes to obtain more thorough and
                        detailed information references are cited in the text, at the end of
                        an article, at the end of each volume, or in a special bibliographic
                        volume. Encvclopedias include such important illustrative material
                        as maps, diagrams, charts, drawings, reproductions of paintings,
                        photographs, portraits facsimiles, and pictures of coins and
                        flags. Multivolume encyclopedias usually have auxiliary indexes.</p>
                        <p>The course of development of the general encyclopedias took
                        shape in the mid 20th century. In connection with the scientific
                        and technological revolution considerable attention is given to
                        the new branches of science and technology. The number of articles
                         increases, and their length is reduced correspondingly. Various
                         methods of updating, other than revised editions, are used
                        (for example continuous revision - that is, the systematic
                        reprinting of successive sections with partial changes or additions;
                        <q>"encyclopedia magazines"</q> which are continuations of a particular
                        encyclopedia and yearbooks, which supplement tin cij-|fi|
                        nal edition with new information for each year). Increasingly,
                        greater importance is attached to the extent and quality of bibliographic
                        material. Encyclopedias are being designed for a broader
                        range of readers and are becoming more generally accessible.
                        Cumbersome volumes are being supplanted by volumes of
                        comparatively small format, printed on thin paper and in special easy
                        to read type. Inexpensive (<q>"paperback"</q>) editions of encyclopedias
                        and minieditions are growing.</p>
                        <p>The encyclopedia as we know it is of recent origin, but encyclopedic
                         works date back to ancient times in Egypt, Greece and
                        Rome, and to the Middle Ages in Europe, in the countries using
                        Arabic writing and in China. In the world of antiquity the term
                        <q>"encyclopedia"</q> referred to the sum of elementary general knowledge
                        comprising the seven liberal arts and was not applied to a
                        particular type of literary work. The term was first used in the title
                        of an encyclopedic work in 1620 - in <bibl>

                        After the victory of the October Revolution of 1917,
                        preparatory work was begun on encyclopedias based on the ideology
                        of Marxism-Leninism. In the very first years of Soviet 
                        power, V. I. Lenin raised the question of the need for Soviet 
                        dictionaries and encyclopedias and specifically
                        for a concise dictionary
                        of definitions that would be encyclopedic at the same time. The
                        planning stages of these projects lasted until the mid 1920's. A
                        few specialized encyclopedias were published, such as the
