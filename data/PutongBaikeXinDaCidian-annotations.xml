            <p>The preface of the New Encyclopaedic Dictionary for Common Use by Huang Moxi
            A certain commentary tells us that “meaning is the content of the word, speech its outer shell”. Just recently people with magnificent rhetoric have again supported this theory [and said, that] is a rule where which can rely on. 
            If Cangjie in ancient times set himself as Ouyang Xiu and Yan Shu, it would be strange for the reforms bought during the era of Qin and Zhou. In fact, the correct definition of words can be seen when people look at the text. 
            The character expresses, [when split]: “speaking” and “governing” and both the inner and the outer part  indicate [what significance the word] governs. 
            This is eloquently stated in the introduction to the writings of Fan Shaoshu by Master Han [Yu] of Changli in his epitaph: They use their own words, besides; the text is organized in the order of words. 
            Each of them plays a certain role. It has been widespread and discussed among one and other.
            Now, the so-called ‘six categories of script’ are continuously changing and human relations are becoming daily more and more complex; everything is everywhere continuously on the move. 
            The pronunciation of words may have remained the same, but their meaning changed, or their meaning been retained but the pronunciation changed, so that more often than not one does not know the function of a word one has used all one’s life. 
            Ever since the opening up of sea communication with countries abroad (during the 19th century), retranslations were made through different foreign languages [into Chinese], 
            the new and the old merge in chaotic fusion; individuals make up their own terms, schools go their own way in their interpretation, things go from one dead end to another and one mistake leads to the next.
            Although the immortal Lu Cun and Gautama were reborn, they were still dizzy. If there in particular is one phenomenon that is totally impossible to understand, 
            this is that the substantial changes in words are also a general rule of evolution, which is true all over the world. 
            And even more, how come that the system devised by Ju [Song] 沮[誦] and Cang [Jie] 蒼頡.[i.e. the Chinese script] is fleeing in fright from under the twenty-six letter alphabet with its sidewise crawl? 
            How can it be that this divine marvel, at its origin accompanied by a rain of millet and the cries of ghosts, has in one fell swoop become almost dumb and blind 
            while the Latin alphabet with a wave made by a single ladle was all alone able to seep in within the four seas and to get accepted all over the place? How could this happen? 
            Alas, there exists a dominant reason for this – namely that our country only has zishu dictionaries listing individual graphs, and leishu - 
            compendia arranged according to certain categories, but no works specializing in the proper usage of words. 
            The different states over there in Europe and America on the other hand have [a situation] that what they call encyclopedic dictionaries always give definitions for terms, things, symbols and numbers. 
            These works all emphasize usage and are strict in regarding to [semantic and grammatical] rules. They are not like our zishu 字書 simplistic and ambiguous or like our leishu 類書 confused and disjointed. 
            That is why [in these Western works] names and facts do not deviate from each other and both their similarities and differences are presented. 
            This is one of the basic driving forces for the power and prosperous of these nations and the development of the talents of their people. 
            In our country, however, all gates remain, as before, closed, leaving not a single crack opened… 
            
            If they insist to continue defending the old-styled way of text composition, then zishu and leishu, although they are both supplementary to each other, 
            will then be useless. Their reform today would show good effects and [ease] communication. When they would be used in school, the quality would be improved. …. 
            
            When I am looking upon my own country and wish to initiate the project of dictionaries, the difficulties faced would be hundred times more than that in other countries. …
            
            And so the head of the Society for the Preservation of National Learning, Shen Cuifen, resolved to compile an encyclopaedic dictionary, therefore I would forget my intellectual shallowness thus determined to take the responsibility. Enlisting the talents of Ma and Zheng, [we]
            explored profound mysteries, analyzed, separating and classifying. In the space of the time it takes to change from fur to linen [one year], a work of a million and a few hundred thousand characters
            was complete. …
            
            As for myself, I am delighted for being a pioneer in providing thing needed at this time, positioning myself [like Chen She] „with the fire covered by a wicker basket and howling like a fox“.

                <p>The preface by Huang himself, which is the 2nd preface of the book, preface is written in a very literary style with allusions to China’s political, 
                   literary and religious history. Huang tries to show that the changing semantic fields of Chinese characters need to be well represented in proper dictionaries. 
                   Unfortunately, until about 1900, the Chinese had  only leishu and cishu, which were not well organized and didn’t comprise a logical structure. 
                   It has been a great enterprise, but he has finished it and thinks, that it will have a share in building up a strong nation and educating its citizens in a way as it happened before in Western societies. .</p>

                <p>“[…] Huang’s encyclopaedia was published with great cultural and economic success […].” (Doleželová, 346). As for its short entries, which let it function as a reference work, 
                    and the complicated preface, the encyclopedia might have been more suitable for a readership with a higher educational background..</p>

                <p>Huang Ren shared admiration for the scholarly achievements of the West, but was deeply rooted in Chinese culture as well. 
                    With this book he wants to show that the West is an object worth studying. He shows a great deal of belief into scientific truths and findings. 
                    In addition he takes a stance against the Manchus, although in a rather implicit way. </p>
