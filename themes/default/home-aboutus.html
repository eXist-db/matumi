                            <p>Research project D11 “Hidden Grammars of Transculturality”, coordinated by Prof. Barbara Mittler and Prof. Madeleine Herren, brings together research on European and Asian encyclopedias. It continues the project “Allgemeinwissen und Gesellschaft” (http://www.enzyklopaedie.ch/) from Zurich University, and integrates Prof. Rudolf G. Wagner’s annotated bibliography and collection of “Chinese Encyclopedic Works 1840-1937, their Japanese and Western Models and Sources” from Heidelberg. In a joint effort, the research group analyzed and compared various aspects of encyclopedic works in the different cultures, and held several international conferences.</p>
                            <p>The Encyclopedia Database was created in 2010 and since then has been filled continually with a growing number of source materials in full-text as well as images. The aim of the database is to provide a strong tool and interactive platform for further analysis of encyclopedic material in different languages. Started by Jens Ostergaard Petersen as an XML-TEI database, it was mainly programmed by Wolfgang Meier of eXistsolutions, while the organization of source materials and coordination of all work was done by Kaja Mueller-Wang. Many students and lecturers also participated in the creation of the database.</p>
                            <p>The first stage of the project (2010-2012) included the completion of main database functionality and the integration of excerpts from nearly 100 encyclopedic works. In the next stage, project members will be concerned with the input of more data, fine tuning on functionality, and enhancement of user-friendliness. </p>
